# FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend such
forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). All statements other than statements of
historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may be forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by
terms such as "may," "will," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "could," "intends," "targets," "projects," "contemplates," "believes," "estimates," "forecasts,"
"predicts," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. Forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, future hash rate capacity, industry and business trends,
equity compensation, business strategy, plans, market growth and our objectives for future operations.

The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are only predictions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current
expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Forward-
looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be
materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to:

*   our ability to achieve profitability, and to maintain profitability, in the future;
*   high volatility in the value attributable to our business;
*   the rapidly changing regulatory and legal environment in which we operate, which may lead to unknown future challenges to operating our business or which
    may subject our business to added costs and/or uncertainty regarding our ability to operate;
*   the availability of financing opportunities, risks associated with economic conditions;
*   economic dependence on regulated terms of service and power rates;
*   dependency on continued growth in blockchain and bitcoin usage;
*   security and cybersecurity threats and hacks;
*   dependency on third parties to maintain our cold and hot wallets that hold our bitcoin;
*   changes to bitcoin mining difficulty;
*   our reliance on a limited number of key employees;
*   changes in network and infrastructure;
*   our ability to successfully integrate our newly acquired operations;
*   the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic;
*   our ability to execute on our business strategy;
*   our ability to remediate the material weakness identified in our internal control over financial reporting included in Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for
    the year ended September 30, 2023;
*   our ability to resolve open comments from the SEC on our public filings and any changes to our disclosures as a result of the resolution of such matters;
*   risks relating to our potential establishment of an in-house function to trade bitcoin for our own account on the bitcoin we have mined, and hedge risk relating to
    our bitcoin holdings; and
*   other risks described in the Company's prior press releases and in its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including under the headings
    "Risk Factors" in the Company's Annual

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023, filed with the SEC on December 1, 2023 (the “Form 10-K”). In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim period presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been reflected herein. The results of operations for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal period, as reported in the Form 10-K, have been omitted.

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CleanSpark, Inc., and the Company’s wholly owned subsidiaries, ATL Data Centers LLC (“ATL”), CleanBlok, CleanSpark DW, LLC, CSRE Norcross, LLC, CSRE Property Management Company, LLC, CSRE Properties Washington, LLC, CSRE Properties Sandersville, LLC, CSRE Properties Dalton, LLC, and CleanSpark HQ, LLC. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation of these entities.

Recently issued accounting pronouncements

In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-08, Intangible - Goodwill and Other - Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60) (“ASC 350-60”). ASC 350-60 requires entities with certain crypto assets to subsequently measure such assets at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in net income in each reporting period. Crypto assets that meet all the following criteria are within the scope of the ASC 350-60:

(1)meet the definition of intangible assets as defined in the Codification

(2)do not provide the asset holder with enforceable rights to or claims on underlying goods, services, or other assets

(3)are created or reside on a distributed ledger based on blockchain or similar technology

(4)are secured through cryptography

(5)are fungible, and

(6)are not created or issued by the reporting entity or its related parties. In addition, entities are required to provide additional disclosures about the holdings of certain crypto assets.

Bitcoin, which is the sole crypto asset mined by the Company, meets each of these criteria. For all entities, the ASC 350-60 amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted for both interim and annual financial statements that have not yet been issued (or made available for issuance). The Company has elected to early adopt the new guidance effective October 1, 2023 resulting in a $4,183 cumulative-effect change to adjust the Company's bitcoin held on October 1, 2023 with the corresponding entry to beginning accumulated deficit.

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Improvements to Disclosures About Reportable Segments, which requires enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. In addition, the amendments enhance interim disclosure requirements, clarify circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss, provide new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment, and contain other disclosure requirements. The new guidance is effective for all public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2020-01 on its consolidated financial statements.

In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as if it had originated the contracts. Under the current business combinations guidance, such assets and liabilities are recognized by the acquirer at fair value on the acquisition date. The Company adopted the provisions of the accounting pronouncement as of October 1, 2023 and the new standard did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the first quarter ended December 31, 2023.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments on October 1, 2020 ("ASU 2016-13"). ASU 2016-13 requires entities to use a new forward-looking "expected loss" model that reflects expected credit losses, including credit losses related to trade receivables, and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates, which generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowances for losses. The Company adopted the ASU effective October 1, 2023, and the adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows.

Liquidity

The Company has cash and cash equivalents of $48,458 and bitcoin (measured at fair value) of $126,951 as of December 31, 2023. As shown in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements, the Company generated a net income from continuing operations of $25,909 during the three months ended December 31, 2023. The Company had cash outflows from operating activities from continuing operations, which were $39,626 during the three months ended December 31, 2023. The Company has cash outflows from investing activities from continuing operations due to its investments in capital expenditures in support of its bitcoin mining operations partially offset by proceeds of bitcoin sales. The Company has generated significant cash inflows from financing activities from continuing operations, primarily attributed to proceeds from equity offerings. During the quarter ended December 31, 2023, the Company sold $43,035 of bitcoin at various times during the quarter and utilized the proceeds to funds its operations. During the quarter ended December 31, 2023, the Company sold $43,035 of bitcoin at various times during the quarter and utilized the proceeds to pay expenditures. However, the Company utilized sufficient cash and bitcoin, which should continue to support its ongoing operations for the next twelve months. The Company intends to continue generating cash from its access to equity financing through its At-the-Market offering facility (see Note 12).

Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial

statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include valuation of derivative assets, available-for-sale
investments, and the valuations of share-based awards. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to
be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions including, but not limited to, the ultimate impact
that the ongoing global supply chain issues may have on the Company's operations.

**Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Revenue from Bitcoin Mining**

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606 - *Revenue from Contracts with Customers* (ASC 606). The core principle of the revenue standard
is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the
company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle:

1.  Identify the contract with the customer
2.  Identify the performance obligations in the contract
3.  Determine the transaction price
4.  Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
5.  Recognize revenue when the Company satisfies a performance obligation

**Step 1:** The Company enters into a contract with a bitcoin mining pool operator (i.e., the customer) to provide computing power to the mining pools. The contracts are
terminable at any time by either party and there are no penalties for contract termination by either party. The Company earns revenue based on the Full-Pay-Per-Share
("FPPS") payout method, set forth by our customer. The calculation has specific components which include network block subsidies, network difficulty, network
transaction fees, and pool operating fees. The network block subsidy consists of newly generated coins and comprises the largest share of the block reward. Network
difficulty is the difficulty required to mine a block on the Bitcoin network, which is a component in the calculation for payout. Network transaction fees consist of fees
paid by the users of the network for the execution of transactions that are included in the block. Pool operating fees are fees charged by the mining pool operator in order
to operate the pool. Network block subsidies are based on the total amount of block subsidies that are expected to be generated on the bitcoin network as a whole during
the 24-hour period beginning at midnight Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) daily, regardless of whether the mining pool operator successfully records a block to the
blockchain. Network difficulty is based on the actual difficulty to mine a block on the Bitcoin network. Network transaction fees are based on the total amount of
transaction fees and block rewards that are actually generated on the blockchain network as a whole during the 24-hour period. Pool operating fees are determined by a
fee rate set forth in the customer's terms of service as a percentage of the actual daily FPPS payout.

The mining pool that the Company contributes its hash computation computing power only provides services for bitcoin mining and the fees charged during the most
recent quarter were 0.19% of the total daily bitcoin mined. Applying the criteria per ASC 606-10-25-1, the contract arises at the point that the Company provides
computing power to the mining pool operator, which is beginning contract day at midnight UTC (contract inception), because customer consumption is in tandem with
daily earnings of delivery of the computing power.

**Step 2:** In order to identify the performance obligations in a contract with a customer, a company must assess the promised goods or services in the contract and identify
each promised good or service that is distinct. A performance obligation meets ASC 606's definition of a "distinct" good or service (or bundle of goods or services) if
both of the following criteria are met:

*   The customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (i.e., the good or
    service is capable of being distinct); and
*   The entity's promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (i.e., the promise to transfer the
    good or service is distinct within the context of the contract).

Based on these criteria, the Company has a single performance obligation in providing computing power services (i.e., hashrate) to the mining pool operator (i.e., customer). The performance obligation of computing power services is fulfilled daily over-time, as opposed to a point in time, because the Company provides the hashrate throughout the day and the customer simultaneously obtains control of it and uses the asset to produce bitcoin. The Company has full control of the mining equipment utilized in the mining pool and if the Company determines it will increase or decrease the processing power of its machines and/or fleet (i.e., for repairs or when power costs are excessive) the computing power provided to the customer will be reduced.

Step 3: The transaction consideration the Company earns is non-cash digital consideration in the form of bitcoin, which the Company measures at fair value as the closing bitcoin price on the date earned as determined from using the price at the inception of each daily contract. According to the customer contract, daily earnings are calculated from midnight-to-midnight UTC time, and the sub-account balance is credited one hour later at 1:00 AM UTC time. The Company utilizes Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), which is also the midnight of UTC time, since this is consistent with our customer contract in calculating our daily earnings from midnight-to-midnight UTC time.

The transaction consideration the Company earns is all variable since it is dependent on the daily computing power provided by the Company. The Company's bitcoins earned through the contractual payout formula is not known until the Company's computational hashrate contributed is fulfilled over-time daily between midnight-to-midnight UTC time. The Company's proportionate amount of the global network transaction fee rewards earned are calculated at the end of each transactional day (midnight to midnight). There are no other forms of variable considerations, such as discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price concessions, incentives, performance bonuses, penalties, or other similar items.

The Company fully constrains all variable consideration as a result of ASC 606-10-32-12a because the amount of consideration is highly susceptible to factors outside of our control as defined by the Company's customer's payout methodology. The variable consideration is constrained until the Company can reasonably estimate the amount of mining rewards by the end of a given transactional day based on the actual amount of computing power provided to the mining pool operators. By then, the Company considers it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of revenues will not occur and includes such variable consideration in the transaction price.

Step 4: The transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation upon verification for the provision of computing power to the mining pool operator. There is a single performance obligation (i.e., computing power or hashrate) for the contract; therefore, all consideration from the mining pool operator is allocated to this single performance obligation.

Step 5: The Company's performance is complete in transferring the hashrate service over-time (midnight to midnight) to the customer and the customer obtains control of that asset.

In exchange for providing computing power, the Company is entitled to a pro-rata share of the fixed bitcoin awards earned over the measurement period, plus a pro-rata fractional share of the global transaction fee rewards for the respective measurement period, less net digital asset fees due to the mining pool operator over the measurement period, as applicable. The transaction consideration the Company receives is non-cash consideration, in the form of bitcoin. The Company measures the bitcoin at fair value on the date earned using the closing price of bitcoin on the date earned (midnight UTC).

There are no deferred revenues or other liability obligations recorded by the Company since there are no payments in advance of the performance. At the end of the 24 hour "midnight-to-midnight" period, there are no remaining performance obligations.

Revenues from data center services

As of September 30, 2023, data center services are no longer provided to external customers. The Company formerly provided data services, such as providing its customers with rack space, power and equipment, and cloud services, such as virtual services, virtual storage, and data backup services, generally based on monthly services provided at a defined price included in the contracts. The performance obligations were the services provided to a customer for the month based on the contract. The transaction price was the price agreed with the customer for the monthly services provided and the revenues are recognized monthly based on the services rendered for the month.

## Cost of Revenues

*Bitcoin mining segment (sole reportable segment)*

The Company includes energy costs and external co-location mining hosting fees in cost of revenues.

## Cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash

Cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. Temporary cash investments are made with high credit quality financial institutions. At times, such investments in U.S. accounts may be in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limit.

The Company does have restricted cash of $1,716 as of December 31, 2023 held in a separate bank account in a certificate of deposit as collateral for utility bonds. The utility bonds are reported in prepaid expense and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet.

## Accounts Receivable, net

Accounts receivable is comprised of uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms. They are initially recorded at the invoiced amount upon the sale of goods or services to customers and do not bear interest. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluation of its customers and management closely monitors outstanding receivables based on factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other information. The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reviewed periodically for collectability. If management determines that collection is unlikely, an allowance that reflects management’s best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected is recorded.

Accounts receivable, net consists of the following:

## Inventory

Inventory balances mainly include supplies inventory used to maintain bitcoin mining facilities and are presented at net realizable value with cost being measured on an average cost method. The Company periodically reviews inventories for unusable and obsolete items. Based on this evaluation, provisions are made to write inventories down to their net realizable value. Inventory was $732 and $809 as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively.

## Prepaid expense and other current assets

The Company records a prepaid expense for costs paid but not yet incurred. Those expected to be incurred within one year are recognized and shown as a short-term prepaid expense. Any costs expected to be incurred outside of one year would be considered other long-term assets.

Other current assets are assets that consist of supplies, deposits and interest receivable. Deposits and interest we expect to receive within one year are shown as short-term. Those we expect to receive outside of one year are shown as other long-term assets.

## Concentration Risk

At times throughout the year, the Company may maintain cash balances in certain bank accounts in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) limits. The cash balance in excess of the FDIC limits was $36,484 and $28,965 as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The accounts offered by the custodian of the Company’s bitcoin, which accounts totaled $126,951 and $56,241 as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively, are not insured by the FDIC. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.

The Company has certain customers and vendors who individually represented 10% or more of the Company’s revenue or capital expenditures. Please refer to Note 16 - Major Customers and Vendors.

**Stock-based compensation**

The Company follows the guidelines in FASB Codification Topic ASC 718-10 Compensation-Stock Compensation, which requires companies to measure the cost of employee and non-employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Stock-based compensation expense for stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company may issue compensatory shares for services including, but not limited to, executive, management, accounting, operations, corporate communication, financial and administrative consulting services. The Company determines the grant date fair value of the options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For equity awards granted by the Company that are contingent upon market-based conditions, the Company fair values these awards using the Monte Carlo simulation model. For discussion of accounting for restricted stock units (“RSUs”), please refer Note 14 – Stock-Based Compensation.

**Earnings (loss) per share**

The Company reports earnings (loss) per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260-10 “Earnings Per Share,” which provides for calculation of “basic” and “diluted” earnings per share. Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an entity. The calculation of diluted net loss per share gives effect to common stock equivalents; however, potential common shares are excluded if their effect is anti-dilutive. All common stock equivalents that consist of options, warrants and restricted stock units were excluded from the calculation of the diluted loss per share.

## Property and equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Construction-in-progress is the construction or development of assets that have not yet been placed in service for their intended use. Depreciation commences once they are ready for their intended use. Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases. Land is not depreciated.

Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows:

<table border="1">

In accordance with the FASB ASC 360-10, Property, Plant and Equipment, the carrying value of property and equipment and other long-lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment. The Company recognizes impairment when the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. Impairment losses, if any, are measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value. During the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company did not record an impairment expense on property and equipment.

## Bitcoin

Bitcoin are included in current assets in the consolidated balance sheets due to the Company’s ability to sell bitcoin in a highly liquid marketplace and such bitcoin holdings are expected to be realized in cash or sold or consumed during the normal operating cycle of the Company.

As a result of adopting ASC 350-60 on October 1, 2023, bitcoin is measured at fair value as of each reporting period (see Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements). The fair value of bitcoin is measured using the period-end closing bitcoin price from its principal market, Coinbase, in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. Since bitcoin is traded on a 24-hour period, the Company utilizes the price as of midnight UTC time, which aligns with the Company’s revenue recognition cut-off. The increase and decrease in fair value from each reporting period is reflected on the consolidated statements of operation as “Gain on fair value of bitcoin, net”. The Company sells bitcoin and such gains and losses from such transactions are measured as the difference between the cash proceeds and the carrying basis of bitcoin as determined on a First-In First-Out (“FIFO”) basis and are also recorded within the same line item “Gain on fair value of bitcoin, net”.

Prior to issuance of the ASU 2023-08 and adoption of ASC 350-60, bitcoin were recorded at cost less impairment and were classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles — Goodwill and Other. Bitcoin was accounted for in connection with the Company’s revenue recognition policy detailed above. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life was not amortized but was assessed for impairment annually, or more frequently, when events or changes in circumstances occurred indicating that it was more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset was impaired. Impairment exists when the carrying amount exceeds its fair value. In testing for impairment for periods under prior accounting guidance, the Company had the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it was more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it was determined that it was not more likely than not that an impairment exists, a quantitative impairment test was not necessary. If the Company concluded otherwise, it was required to perform a quantitative impairment test. The Company elected to perform the quantitative impairment test each period rather than first performing the qualitative assessment. Quantitative impairment was measured using the intraday low bitcoin price from Coinbase in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement. To the extent an impairment loss is recognized, the loss establishes the new cost basis of the asset. Subsequent reversal of impairment losses was not permitted as per ASC 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other.

Bitcoin, which is non-cash consideration earned by the Company through its mining activities, are included as a reconciling item as a cash outflow within operating activities on the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The cash proceeds from the sales of bitcoin are classified based on the holding period in which the bitcoin are held. ASC 350-60 provides guidance on classifying proceeds from bitcoin and concludes that bitcoin converted nearly immediately into cash would qualify as cash flows from operating activities. All other sales would qualify as investing activities. In prior fiscal periods, the Company did not hold its bitcoin for extended periods of time and such sales proceeds prior to the adoption of ASC 350-60, were reported as cash flows from operating activities. Upon adoption, the Company evaluates its sales of bitcoin and will record bitcoin sold nearly immediately as operating cash flows and the remainder will be recorded as investing activities. During the quarter ended December 31, 2023, all proceeds from bitcoin sales were classified as investing activities.

Fair Value Measurement of financial instruments, derivative asset and contingent consideration

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company utilizes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of input, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable.

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. These are typically obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets.

Level 2 Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices included for identical or similar assets and liabilities that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets. These are typically obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments.

Level 3 Unobservable inputs, where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability. These inputs reflect the reporting entity’s own beliefs about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, based on the best information available under the circumstances.

The carrying value of cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses and short-term portion of loan payable approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of the instruments. The carrying amount of the Company’s long-term portion of loan payable is also stated at fair value since the stated rate of interest approximates market rates. Management believes the Company is not exposed to significant interest or credit risks arising from these financial instruments.

The following table presents the Company’s financial instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on the Company’s balance sheets on a recurring basis, and their level within the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023:

December 31, 2023

The activities of the financial instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on the Company’s balance sheets on a recurring basis during the three months ended December 31, 2023 are described in Note 6 - Investments.

**Discontinued Operations**

The Company deemed its energy operations to be discontinued operations due to its strategic decision to strictly focus on its bitcoin mining operations and divest of the majority of its energy assets.

Through its discontinued operations segment, the Company previously provided energy solutions through its wholly-owned subsidiaries CleanSpark, LLC, CleanSpark Critical Power Systems, Inc., GridFabric, LLC, and Solar Watt Solutions, Inc. These solutions consisted of engineering, design and software solutions, Open Automated Demand response, solar, energy storage for microgrid and distributed energy systems. The Company has sold the majority of its assets related to the Energy Segment, which included software and intellectual property, and inventory. See Note 4 – Discontinued Operations.

**3.ACQUISITIONS**

**Acquisitions Relating to Continuing Operations**

**Coinmaker LLC Acquisition - Dalton, GA**

On June 21, 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of two bitcoin mining facilities in Dalton, GA for $9,389. Each of the facilities are located on separate one-acre sites, each of which are under land leases. The combined facilities utilize 20 megawatts of power and operates a total of approximately 6,000 miners. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition, whereby the total purchase price is allocated first to the fair value of the assets acquired and any excess purchase price is allocated to the acquired assets pro-rata. No goodwill is calculated in an asset acquisition.

The allocation of the purchase price of the assets acquired are summarized below:

| ($ in thousands) | Allocation at Acquisition Date |
|---|---|
| Land lease - right of use asset | $ 266 |
| Operating lease liability | (266) |
| Building | 1,328 |
| Infrastructure | 8,061 |
| **Total purchase price** | $ 9,389 |

There have been no subsequent adjustments to the allocation of the purchase price after the preliminary allocation.

**4.DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS**

The Company determined to make available for sale the asset groups related to the energy segment due to its strategic shift to strictly focus on its bitcoin mining operations. As a result, the energy segment’s results of operations have been reclassified as discontinued operations on a retrospective basis for all periods presented. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of this segment are separately reported as “assets and liabilities held for sale” as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023 in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company has since sold the majority of its software and intellectual property assets related to the energy segment and is in the process of selling additional remaining inventory.

The carrying basis represents the valuation of bitcoin at the time the Company earns the bitcoin through mining activities.
The Carrying amount for 2,243 bitcoin held as of the adoption of ASC 350-60, was determined on the "cost less impairment" basis.
The Company's bitcoin holdings are not subject to rehypothecation and do not serve as collateral for any existing loans or agreements. As of December 31, 2023, the
Company held no other crypto currency (except for a de minimis amount of USD Coin).
As of December 31, 2023, the Company held 97% of its bitcoin in cold storage and 3% in hot wallets and as of September 30, 2023 held 95% of its bitcoin in cold
storage and 5% in hot wallets.

6.INVESTMENTS
As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, the Company had total investments of $2,209 and $3,423, respectively, that are comprised of the following:
Investment in Debt Securities (Preferred Stock) and related Embedded Derivative Asset
On November 5, 2019, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the "SPA"), dated as of November 6, with International Land Alliance, Inc.
("ILAL").
Pursuant to the terms of the SPA with ILAL, the Company purchased 1,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock of ILAL (the "ILAL Preferred Stock") for an aggregate
purchase price of $500, less certain expenses and fees. The Series B Preferred Stock accrue cumulative in-kind accruals at a rate of 12% per annum and were
redeemable on August 6, 2020. The ILAL Preferred Stock can be converted into common stock at a variable rate (refer to the discussion on embedded derivative assets
below). This variable conversion ratio will increase by 10% with the occurrence of certain events. Since the investments were not redeemed on August 6, 2020, they are
now redeemable at the Company's option in cash or into common stock, based on the conversion ratio. The ILAL Preferred Stock is recorded as an available-for-sale
("AFS") debt security and is reported at its estimated fair value as of December 31, 2023. Any change in the fair values of AFS debt securities are reported net of
income tax as an element of Other Comprehensive Income.
The Company accrued no interest, net on our available-for-sale debt securities as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The fair value of
investment in Debt Securities is $755 and $726 as of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company has included gain on change in fair value
of preferred stock amounting to $29 for the three months ended December 31, 2023, and $29 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, as part of Other
Comprehensive Income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).
The Company has deemed this variable conversion feature of the ILAL Preferred Stock as an embedded derivative instrument in accordance with ASC Topic No. 815.
This topic requires the Company to account for the conversion

satisfy the eligibility and transaction requirements for use of Form S-3, including General Instruction I.B.6 of Registration Statement on Form S-3, from time to time
through the Agent, or to them, as sales agent and/or principal, on the terms set forth therein.
On January 5, 2024, the Company entered into a new At The Market Offering Agreement (the "2024 ATM Agreement") with the Agent, to create an at-the-market
equity program under which the Company may, but has no obligation to, issue and sell up to the lesser number of shares of the Company's common stock that does not

# Page 34 of 52

```markdown
On January 20, 2021, Scott Bishins (“Bishins”), individually, and on behalf of all others similarly situated (together, the “Class”), filed a class action complaint (the “Class Complaint”) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company, its Chief Executive Officer, Zachary Bradford (“Bradford”), and its Chief Financial Officer at the time, Lori Love (“Love”) (such action, the “Class Action”). Subsequent to the filing of the Class Action, Darshan Hasthantra, as lead Plaintiff (together with Bishins, the “Plaintiffs”) filed an amended complaint (the “Amended Class Complaint”), which named S. Matthew Schultz (“Schultz”) as a defendant (the Company, Bradford and Schultz, collectively, the “Defendants”) and no longer named Love as a defendant.

The Amended Class Complaint alleges that, between December 10, 2020 and August 16, 2021 (the “Class Period”), Defendants made material misstatements and omissions regarding the Company’s acquisition of ATL and its anticipated expansion of bitcoin mining operations and seeks: (a) certification of the Class, (b) an award of compensatory damages to the Class, and (c) an award of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Class in the litigation.

To date, no class has been certified in the Class Action, and the case is moving forward in discovery.

The Company believes that the claims raised in the Amended Class Complaint are without merit. The Company intends to defend itself vigorously against these claims. At this time, the Company is unable to estimate potential losses, if any, related to the Amended Class Complaint.

**Shareholder Derivative Actions**

**Consolidated Ciceri Derivative Actions**

On May 26, 2021, Andrea Ciceri (“Ciceri”), derivatively on behalf of CleanSpark, Inc., filed a verified shareholder derivative action (the “Ciceri Derivative Action”) in the United States District Court in the District of Nevada against certain of the Company’s officers and directors (collectively referred to as “Ciceri Derivative Defendants”) (Ciceri v. Bradford, Schultz, Love, Beynon, McNeill and Wood). On June 22, 2021, Mark Perna (“Perna”) (Ciceri, Perna, and Ciceri Derivative Defendants collectively referred to as the “Parties”) filed a verified shareholder derivative action (the “Perna Derivative Action”) in the same court with similar allegations. On June 29, 2021, the Court consolidated the Ciceri Derivative Action with the Perna Derivative Action (the consolidated case referred to as the “Consolidated Ciceri Derivative Action”). The Consolidated Ciceri Derivative Action asserts claims of breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets and seeks declaratory relief, monetary damages, and imposition of adequate corporate governance and internal controls.

In June 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors appointed a special litigation committee (the “SLC”), comprised of independent Directors and represented by independent counsel to investigate, evaluate and prosecute as appropriate any and all claims asserted in the Consolidated Ciceri Derivative Action as well as the Consolidated Smith Derivative Actions (defined below). On October 23, 2023, the Court stayed the case until July 23, 2024, pending the completion of the SLC’s investigation.

The Company believes that the claims raised in that case are without merit. The Company intends to both defend itself vigorously against these claims and to vigorously prosecute any counterclaims. At this time, the Company is unable to estimate potential losses, if any, related to the Consolidated Ciceri Derivative Action.

**Consolidated Smith Derivative Actions**

On February 21, 2023, Brandon Smith (“Smith”), derivatively on behalf of CleanSpark, Inc., filed a verified shareholder derivative action in the Eighth Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada in and for Clark County against certain of the Company’s officers and directors (Smith v. Bradford, Love, Schultz, Beynon, McNeill and Wood).

On February 24, 2023, Plaintiff Nicholas Iraci (“Iraci”), derivatively on behalf of CleanSpark, Inc., filed a verified shareholder derivative action (the “Iraci Derivative Action”) in the Eighth Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada in and for Clark County against certain of the Company’s officers and directors (Iraci v. Bradford, Love, Schultz, Beynon, McNeill and Wood).

On March 1, 2023, Plaintiff Eric Atanasoff (“Atanasoff”), derivatively on behalf of CleanSpark, Inc., filed a verified shareholder derivative action (the “Atanasoff Derivative Action”) in the Eighth Judicial District Court of the State of

Nevada in and for Clark County against certain of the Company's Officers and Directors (Atanasoff v. Bradford, Schultz, Beynon, McNeill, and Wood).

On March 8, 2023, Plaintiff Travis France ("France"), derivatively on behalf of CleanSpark, Inc., filed a verified shareholder derivative action (the "France Derivative Action") in the Eighth Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada in and for Clark County against certain of the Company's officers and directors (France v. Bradford, Love, Tadayon, Schultz, Beynon, McNeill and Wood).

Ultimately, each of the aforementioned derivative actions were consolidated into the Smith Derivative Action in the Eighth Judicial District Court of Nevada (the "Consolidated Smith Derivative Actions").

The operative Consolidated Smith Derivative Actions assert claims of breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment and corporate waste and seek monetary damages, restitution, declaratory relief, litigation costs, and imposition of adequate corporate governance and internal controls.

On November 6, 2023, the Court stayed the Consolidated Smith Derivative Action for five months pending the completion of the SLC's investigation.

The Company believes that the claims raised in Consolidated Smith Derivative Actions are without merit. The Company intends to both defend itself vigorously against these claims and to vigorously prosecute any counterclaims. At this time, the Company is unable to estimate potential losses, if any, related to the Consolidated Smith Derivative Actions.

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.

16. MAJOR CUSTOMERS AND VENDORS

The Company has one mining pool operator (Foundry Digital) that represented 100% of revenue for the periods ended three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
($ presented in 000's, except for bitcoin price)

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the interim consolidated financial statements and
related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes as disclosed in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 ("Form 10-K"). This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current
expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of
various factors, including those set forth under Part II, Item 1A "Risk Factors" or in other parts of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as those identified in
the "Risk Factors" section of our Form 10-K. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future. See
"Forward-Looking Statements."

Company Overview
We are a bitcoin mining company. We have no intention to mine, purchase or hold any other cryptocurrency at this time or in the foreseeable future (although we held a
de minimis amount of USD Coin ("USDC") as of December 31, 2023). We independently own and operate five data centers in Georgia for a total developed capacity of
230 MW. We are developing an additional 150 MW at our data center in Sandersville, GA. We have a partner in Massena, NY, that hosts 50 MW for us. We design our
infrastructure to responsibly support Bitcoin, the world's most important digital commodity and an essential tool for financial independence and inclusion. We strive to
leave the planet better than we found it by investing in communities that source low-carbon energy, like wind, solar, nuclear, and hydro. We cultivate trust and
transparency among our employees, the communities we operate in, and the people around the world who depend on Bitcoin.
Bitcoin Mining
Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 with the goal of serving as a digital means of exchanging and storing value. Bitcoin is a form of digital currency that depends upon a
consensus-based network and a public ledger called a "blockchain", which contains a record of every bitcoin transaction ever processed. The bitcoin network is the first
decentralized peer-to-peer payment network, powered by users participating in the consensus protocol, with no central authority or middlemen, that has wide network
participation. The authenticity of each bitcoin transaction is protected through digital signatures that correspond with addresses of users that send and receive bitcoin.
Users have full control over remitting bitcoin from their own sending addresses. All transactions on the bitcoin blockchain are transparent, allowing those running the
appropriate software to confirm the validity of each transaction. To be recorded on the blockchain, each bitcoin transaction is validated through a proof-of-work
consensus method, which entails solving complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and post them on the blockchain. This process is called mining. Miners
are rewarded with bitcoins, both in the form of newly created bitcoins and fees in bitcoin, for successfully solving the mathematical problems and providing computing
power to the network.

Factors such as access to computer processing capacity, interconnectivity, electricity cost, environmental factors (such as cooling capacity) and location play important
roles in mining. As of December 31, 2023, our operating mining units were capable of producing over 10.0 exahash per second ("EH/s") of computing power. In bitcoin
mining, "hashrate" is a measure of the computing and processing power and speed by which a mining computer mines and processes transactions on the bitcoin network.
We expect to continue increasing our computing power through 2024 and beyond as we expand our infrastructure at our owned sites in the State of Georgia, seek
strategic acquisition targets, and through strategic co-location agreements. As of the date of this filing, February 8, 2024, we are capable of producing 12.5 EH/s of
computing power. A company's computing power measured in hashrate is generally considered to be one of the most important metrics for evaluating bitcoin mining
companies.

We own approximately 146,000 miners as of December 31, 2023, of which approximately 88,500 are in service and the remainder mainly pertains to new machines
ready to install in the Sandersville, GA expansion. These miners range in age from 2-36 months and have an average age of approximately 11 months. We do not have
scheduled downtime for our miners, however, we periodically perform unscheduled maintenance on our miners, but such downtime has not historically been significant.
When performing unscheduled maintenance, we will typically replace the miner

with a substitute miner to limit overall downtime. The miners owned as of December 31, 2023 have a range of energy efficiency (watts per terahash – “w/th”) of 17.5 to 38 w/th with an average energy efficiency of 26.4 w/th.

We obtain bitcoin as a result of our mining operations, and we sell bitcoin from time to time, to support our operations and strategic growth. We do not currently plan to engage in regular trading of bitcoin (other than as necessary to convert our bitcoin into U.S. dollars) or to engage in hedging activities related to our holding of bitcoin; however, our decisions to hold or sell bitcoin at any given time may be impacted by the bitcoin market, which has been historically characterized by significant volatility. Currently, we do not use a formula or specific methodology to determine whether or when we will sell bitcoins. Rather, decisions to hold or sell bitcoins are currently determined by management by analyzing forecasts and monitoring the market in real time.

The value of bitcoin has historically been subject to wide swings. The following table provides a range of intraday low and intraday high bitcoin prices between October 1, 2022 through December 31, 2023.

<br>
<br>

| Range of intraday bitcoin prices |  |  |  |
| :-------------------------------- | :----------------- | :----------------- | :----------------- |
| Quarterly Reporting Periods Ended |  | Minimum Price | Maximum Price |
| December 31, 2022 |  | $ 15,460 | $ 21,479 |
| March 31, 2023 |  | $ 16,490 | $ 29,190 |
| June 30, 2023 |  | $ 24,750 | $ 31,444 |
| September 30, 2023 |  | $ 24,900 | $ 31,862 |
| December 31, 2023 |  | $ 26,521 | $ 45,000 |

<br>

As of December 31, 2023, we held 3,002 bitcoins. The fair value of our bitcoins as of December 31, 2023 was $126,951 on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Effective October 1, 2023, we adopted ASC 350-60 which required bitcoin to be measured at fair value. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for more details on impact of implementation to the financial statements. As a result, the carrying value of each bitcoin we held at the end of December 31, 2023 and each subsequent reporting period reflects the price of bitcoin quoted on the active exchange at the end of the reporting period. Therefore, negative swings in the market price of bitcoin could have a material impact on our earnings and on the carrying value of our bitcoin.

As of December 31, 2023, we held $0.05 in USDC, which is a digital currency that is fully backed by U.S. dollar assets, with the value of one USDC coin pegged 1:1 to the value of one U.S. dollar.

Through our wholly owned subsidiaries CSRE Properties, LLC, CSRE Property Management Company LLC, CSRE Properties Norcross, LLC, CSRE Properties Washington, LLC, CSRE Properties Sandersville, LLC, CSRE Properties Dalton, LLC and CleanSpark HQ, LLC, we maintain real property holdings.

**Discontinued Operations**

As of June 30, 2022, we deemed our energy operations to be discontinued operations due to our strategic decision to strictly focus on bitcoin mining operations and divest of our energy assets.

Bitcoin Mining Operations

Overview

We operate a fleet of servers commonly known as miners or ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits), which are computer chips customized for a specific use. In the case of bitcoin mining, ASICs calculate the SHA-256 algorithm as efficiently and quickly as possible in order to compete with other miners to solve blocks. Each calculation is a hash, and each machine's computational power is measured in terahash processed per second ("th/s"). One terahash is equal to 1 trillion hashes. The more terahash we produce and contribute into the mining pool, the higher our percentage of the blockchain reward.

There are a variety of factors that influence our ability to mine bitcoin profitability. Our ability to mine profitability is dependent on successfully navigating these fluctuating variables, which include bitcoin's value in USD (the volatility of which is described above), mining difficulty, global hashrate, power prices, fleet energy efficiency, data center energy efficiency, and other factors.

The energy efficiency of a mining fleet helps drive profitability, because the most significant direct expense for bitcoin mining is power. We measure efficiency by the watts of energy required to produce each terahash of processing power ("w/th"). We believe we operate a highly efficient fleet of miners. The table below describes our fleet as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 and describes our miner efficiency and computing power as compared to the global computing power.

(2) Watts of energy required to produce each terahash of processing power.

As of December 31, 2023, our operating hashrate was approximately 1.80% of the total global hashrate, and we received approximately the same percentage of the global blockchain rewards, which as of that date, equaled approximately 15-17 bitcoin per day, excluding the bitcoin earned from network transaction fees. Ultimately, in order to mine profitably, we work to ensure that these mining rewards cover our direct operating costs.

We also incurred hosting fees of $5,574 and profit sharing fees of $1,409 for the three months ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $655, or 11%, and increase of $683, or 94%, as compared to $6,229 and $726, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The hosting fees and profit sharing fees are primarily the result of our co-location agreement with Coinmint. The hosting fees remained consistent for both period since the decrease in KWHs utilized was offset by the increase in the rate charged per KWH.

**Professional fees**

Professional fees, which consists primarily of legal, accounting and consulting fees, were $1,572 for the three months ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of $1,259, or 44%, from $2,831 for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Legal expenses were $158 for the three months ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $1,955 for the three months ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily attributable to no legal settlements during the three months ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $1,010 of legal settlements during the three months ended December 31, 2022. Other professional fees, namely accounting and consulting, were $1,414 for the three months ended December 31, 2023, as compared to $876 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, representing a increase of $538.

**Payroll expenses**

Payroll expenses were $15,321 for the three months ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $5,519, or 56%, from $9,802 for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Our payroll expenses include all compensation related expenses for our employees and mainly include salaries, wages, payroll-related taxes and benefits and non-cash stock-based compensation. Payroll expenses, excluding non-cash stock-based compensation, were $5,368 for the three months ended December 31, 2023, representing an increase of 37% from $3,924 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 mainly attributed to an increase in employee headcount.

We grant stock-based awards to certain employees as a significant portion of our payroll-related costs. Stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash expense, was $9,953 for the three months ended December 31, 2023, an increase of $4,075, or 69%, from $5,878 for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The increase in stock based compensation was mainly attributed to the vesting of a certain market-based restricted stock awards in December 2023.

**General and administrative expenses**

General and administrative expenses increased to $5,003 for the three months ended December 31, 2023 from $3,724 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, representing an increase of $1,279. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in corporate overhead, including, but not limited to, taxes, licenses, and insurance premiums.

**Gain on fair value of bitcoin, net**

Gain on fair value of bitcoin, net for the three months ended December 31, 2023 is $36,041. As discussed in Notes 2 and Note 5 above, the Company adopted the amendments per ASC 350-60 in the current period, and accordingly, we measured crypto assets within the scope of ASC Topic 820 - *Fair Value Measurement* and included the gains and losses from remeasurement in net income. The gain pertains to the change in bitcoin's fair value with ASC Topic 350-60 - *Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Crypto Assets* at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 820 - *Fair Value Measurement* and included the gains and losses from remeasurement in net income. The gain pertains to the change in bitcoin's fair value from adoption date, October 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023.

Prior to adoption of ASC 350-60 - Crypto Assets, bitcoin was classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets and were measured at cost less impairment. Additionally, in the previous guidance, subsequent increases in bitcoin prices are not allowed to be recorded (unrealized gains) unless the bitcoin is sold, at which point the gain is recognized. Accordingly, gains (losses) recognized on fair value of bitcoin in fiscal year 2024 are not comparable to fiscal year 2023.

**Other impairment expense (related to bitcoin)**
```

---


# Page 43 of 52

Impairment expense in the amount of $83 was recognized for the three months ended December 31, 2022. There is no impairment expense related to bitcoin for the three months ended December 31, 2023 due to the adoption of ASC 350-60 (as described in Note 2 and Note 5) which resulted in measuring bitcoin at fair value and recognizing gains or losses from remeasurement of the assets rather than at cost less impairment. The prior year impairment expense consists of bitcoin impairments due to the general decrease in bitcoin prices during the year. Decreases in bitcoin prices for periods subsequent to the mining date were recorded as impairment expense. Under ASC Topic 350 - Goodwill and Other (prior guidance), subsequent increases in bitcoin prices are not allowed to be recorded (unrealized gains) unless the bitcoin is sold, at which point the gain is recognized.

Realized loss on sale of bitcoin

Realized loss on sale of bitcoin was $517 for the three months ended December 31, 2022. As described under the heading "Gain on fair value of bitcoin, net", gains (losses) recognized on bitcoin transactions in fiscal year 2024 are not comparable to fiscal year 2023.

Depreciation and amortization

Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $29,847 for the three months ended December 31, 2023, from $19,329 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, an increase of $10,518. Depreciation expense increased by $10,506, or 56%, during the three months ended December 31, 2023, from $18,827 to $29,333, due to an increase in miners and mining-related equipment being placed in service during the comparative period. Amortization expense for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $514, an increase of $12, or 2%, from $502 for the three months ended December 31, 2022.

Other Income (Expenses)

Other expense was $1,203 for the three months ended December 31, 2023, compared with other expense of $1,605 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, which is a change of $402. Other expense for the three months ended December 31, 2023 consisted primarily of an unrealized loss on derivative security of $1,243 as compared to loss for the same prior year period of $1,271. This change between the periods is the result of a change in fair value of the underlying instrument.
Interest expense in the three months ended December 31, 2023 decreased by $343 to $546 from $889 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 due to lower average debt balances during three months ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022.
Interest income in the three months ended December 31, 2023 increased from the prior year balance was due to an increase in short-term overnight investments.

Net income (loss) from Continuing Operations

Net income from continuing operations for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $25,909 as compared to net loss from continuing operations of $30,488 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, for the reasons discussed above.

Net income (loss)

Net income for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was $25,909, a fluctuation of $54,940 compared to net loss of $29,031 for the three months ended December 31, 2022, for the reasons stated above.

Non-GAAP Measure

We present adjusted EBITDA, which is not a measurement of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). Our non-GAAP "Adjusted EBITDA" excludes (i) impacts of interest, taxes, and depreciation; (ii) our share-based compensation expense, unrealized gains/losses on securities, and, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration with respect to previously completed acquisitions, all of which

Liquidity and Capital Resources
($ presented in 000's)
Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are working capital, capital expenditures, public company costs and general corporate needs. We expect these needs to
continue as we further develop and grow our business. Our principal sources of liquidity have been and are expected to be our cash and cash equivalents and bitcoin
inventory.
As of December 31, 2023, we had total current assets of $181,705, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, inventory, prepaid expenses and other current assets, bitcoin,
investment in debt security and related derivative asset, current assets held for sale, and total assets in the amount of $862,731. Our total current liabilities and total
liabilities as of December 31, 2023 were $42,393 and $52,170, respectively. We had working capital of $139,312 as of December 31, 2023. We sell the bitcoin we mine
to fund operations and to fund capital expenditures. In addition, we have access to equity financing through our At-the-Market offering facility (see Note 12 -
Stockholders' Equity and Note 17 - Subsequent Events to our consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q).
We believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand, together with cash we expect to generate from future operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and
capital expenditure requirements for a period of at least twelve months from the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We are likely to require additional capital
to respond to technological advancements, competitive dynamics or technologies, customer demands, business opportunities, challenges, acquisitions or unforeseen
circumstances and in either the short-term or long-term may determine to engage in equity or debt financings. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing
on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly
limited. In particular, the ongoing impacts of inflation and rising interest rates, and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine have resulted in, and may continue to result
in, significant disruption and volatility in the global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital. If we are unable to raise additional funds when or on the
terms desired, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Material Cash Requirements
We are a party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. These obligations impact our short-term and long-term
liquidity and capital resource needs. Certain contractual obligations are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, while others are considered
future commitments. Our contractual obligations primarily consist of cancelable purchase commitments with various parties to purchase goods or services, primarily
miners and equipment, entered into in the normal course of business and operating leases. For information regarding our other contractual obligations, refer to Note 15 -
Commitments and Contingencies in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended December 31, 2023, and Note 17 - Commitments and Contingencies
included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on December 1, 2023.
We regularly evaluate opportunities to expand our business, including through potential acquisitions of businesses or assets. We will evaluate a variety of sources of
capital in connection with financing any future possible acquisitions, including the incurrence of debt, sales of stock or bitcoin, or using cash on hand. We may also use
the Company's stock as transaction consideration, as we have done in the past.

Operating Activities
Operating activities from continuing operations used $39,626 in cash for the three months ended December 31, 2023, as compared to providing $4,703 in cash for the
three months ended December 31, 2022. Our depreciation and amortization of $29,847, stock based compensation of $9,953, and a decrease in prepaid and other current
assets of $9,010 were the main components of our operating cash inflow for the three months ended December 31, 2023, offset primarily by cash outflows for bitcoin
mining of $73,786, net income of $25,909, and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $8,255. Our cash provided by operating activities during the
three months ended December 31, 2022 was primarily driven by net loss for the period of $29,031, proceeds from the sale of bitcoin of $34,067, gain on change in fair
value of bitcoin of $83, stock based compensation of $5,878, depreciation and amortization of $19,329, increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $3,265,
partially offset by mining of bitcoin of $27,746, realized gain on sale of bitcoin of $517, and increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $1,862.
Investing Activities
Investing activities from continuing operations used $32,818 during the three months ended December 31, 2023, as compared with using $59,011 for the three months
ended December 31, 2022. Our payments on miner (including miner deposits) of $48,858, purchase of fixed assets of $27,503, were the main components of our
investing cash outflow for the three months ended December 31, 2023. This was offset by cash proceeds received from the sale of bitcoin of $43,035. Our payments on
miner deposits of $31,540, the acquisition of Mawson of $22,518, and purchase of fixed assets of $4,953 were the main components of our investing cash outflow for
the three months ended December 31, 2022.
Financing Activities
Cash flows generated from financing activities of continuing operations during the three months ended December 31, 2023 amounted to $92,095, when compared to
$32,971 for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Our cash flows from financing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2023 consisted primarily of
proceeds from the underwritten offering of $99,336 partially offset by payments on loans in the amount of $1,701. Our cash flows from financing activities for the three
months ended December 31, 2022 mainly consisted of proceeds from underwritten offerings of $41,344 partially offset by payments on loans in the amount of $8,430.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and base
our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
the judgments we make about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Because these estimates can vary depending on
the situation, actual results may differ from these estimates. Making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant
uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material
impact on our results of operations, financial position and statement of cash flows.
There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to those disclosed in our Form 10-K. For a description of our critical
accounting policies and estimates, see Part I, Item 1, Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in our notes to the consolidated financial statements in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Please refer to Note 2 in our unaudited consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for recently adopted accounting
pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
The following discussion about the Company's market risk exposures involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in
the forward-looking statements.
Market Price Risk of Bitcoin. The Company holds a significant amount of bitcoin; therefore, it is exposed to the impact of market price changes in bitcoin on its bitcoin
holdings. This exposure would generally manifest itself in the following areas:
•The Company accounts for its bitcoin holdings as indefinite lived intangible assets and records impairment charges whenever the carrying value of bitcoin
holdings on the balance sheet exceeds their fair market value. Subsequent recovery of bitcoin prices would not impact the carrying value of bitcoin on the balance
sheet, as recovery of previously recorded impairment charges are not allowed under current U.S. GAAP.
•Declines in the fair market value of bitcoin will impact the cash value that would be realized if the Company were to sell its bitcoin for cash, therefore having a
negative impact on its liquidity.
At December 31, 2023, the Company held approximately 3,002 bitcoins and the fair value of a single bitcoin was approximately $42,290, meaning that the fair value of
its bitcoin holdings on that date was approximately $127 million.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Limitation on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in our periodic and current reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and
procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management
is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act).
Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2023, our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below.
Material Weakness and Remediation Plan
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified
and included in
management assessment:
16


---


# Page 48 of 52

```markdown
•Information and Technology Controls: Certain individual control deficiencies related to information technology (“IT”) general controls and report reviews aggregate into a material weakness, as follows:
oControls were not fully documented and responding to all of the Complementary User Entity Controls forwarded through Software as a Service (SaaS) vendor audit reports in the design and implementation of suggested controls.
oThere were not always appropriate IT controls related to information produced by the entity (IPE), including spreadsheets, that are relevant to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

This material weakness did not result in any identified misstatements to the financial statements, and there were no changes to previously released financial results. Based on this material weakness, management concluded that at December 31, 2023, internal control over financial reporting was not effective.

Our independent registered public accounting firm, MaloneBailey, LLP, has issued an adverse audit report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, which appears on page F-2 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on December 1, 2023.

Remediation

The Company’s Board of Directors and management take internal control over financial reporting and the integrity of its financial statements seriously. Management has been implementing and continues to implement measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions include the following:
•establish more specific controls to respond to Complementary User Entity Controls forwarded through SaaS vendor audit reports in the design and implementation of suggested controls;
•expand the management and governance over IT system controls, including the creation of a Systems Analyst position and hiring to fill this position;
•establish more specific controls to gain additional comfort over the completeness and accuracy of IPE, including data used in spreadsheets used in the preparation of consolidated financial statements; and
•implement enhanced process controls around internal user access management including provisioning, removal, and periodic review.

We believe that these actions will remediate the material weakness, once management has performed its assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting including the remedial measures described above. The weakness will not be considered remediated, however, until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. We expect that the remediation of this material weakness will be fully completed prior to the end of fiscal year 2024.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Other than as described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2023 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
