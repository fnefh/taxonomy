# FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend such
forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). All statements other than statements of
historical facts contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may be forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by
terms such as "may," "will," "should," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "could," "intends," "targets," "projects," "contemplates," "believes," "estimates," "forecasts,"
"predicts," "potential" or "continue" or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. Forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q include, but are not limited to, statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, future hash rate capacity, industry and business trends,
equity compensation, business strategy, plans, market growth and objectives for future operations.

The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are only predictions. We have based these forward-looking statements largely on our current
expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Forward-
looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be
materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to:

*   our ability to achieve profitability, and to maintain profitability, in the future;
*   high volatility in the value attributable to our business;
*   the rapidly changing regulatory and legal environment in which we operate, which may lead to unknown future challenges to operating our business or which
    may subject our business to added costs and/or uncertainty regarding our ability to operate;
*   the availability of financing opportunities and risks associated with economic conditions;
*   economic dependence on regulated terms of service and power rates;
*   dependency on continued growth in blockchain and bitcoin usage;
*   security and cybersecurity threats and hacks;
*   dependency on third parties to maintain our cold and hot wallets that hold our bitcoin;
*   changes to bitcoin mining difficulty;
*   our reliance on a limited number of key employees;
*   changes in network and infrastructure;
*   our ability to successfully integrate our newly acquired operations;
*   bitcoin halving;
*   our ability to execute on our business strategy;
*   our ability to remediate the material weakness identified in our internal control over financial reporting included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
    fiscal year ended September 30, 2023;
*   our ability to resolve open comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on our public filings and any changes to our disclosures as a
    result of the resolution of such matters;
*   risks relating to our potential establishment of an in-house function to trade bitcoin for our own account on the bitcoin we have mined, and hedge risk relating to
    our bitcoin holdings; and

CLEANSPARK, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited, $ in thousands, except per share and per bitcoin and per terahash amounts)
1.ORGANIZATION
CleanSpark is a bitcoin mining company. The Company independently owns and operates five data centers in Georgia and three data centers in Mississippi for a total
developed capacity of 420 megawatts ("MW") and 435 MW as of March 31, 2024 and April 4, 2024, respectively. The Company has completed an additional 50 MW of
data center infrastructure in Sandersville, GA, which is pending the commissioning of a utility transformer before it goes into service and the Company is currently
finalizing the development of an additional 15 MW expansion at its Dalton, GA location. An independent data center operation in Massena, NY, hosts 50 MW for the
Company. The Company does not currently host miners for any other companies. CleanSpark designs its infrastructure to responsibly support bitcoin, the world's most
important digital commodity and an essential tool for financial independence and inclusion.
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation
The accompanying unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America and the rules of the SEC and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto
contained in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, filed with the SEC on December 1, 2023 (the
"Form 10-K"). In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the
results of operations for the interim period presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been reflected herein. The results of operations for the interim period
are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosures
contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal period, as reported in the Form 10-K, have been omitted.
The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CleanSpark, Inc., and the Company's wholly owned, capitalized, and operating
subsidiaries, ATL Data Centers LLC ("ATL"), CleanBlok, Inc., CleanSpark DW, LLC, CleanSpark GLP, LLC, CSRE Properties Norcross, LLC, CSRE Property
Management Company, LLC, CSRE Properties, LLC, CSRE Properties Washington, LLC, CSRE Properties Sandersville, LLC, CSRE Properties Dalton, LLC,
Dalton15, LLC, CleanSpark MS, LLC, CSRE Properties Mississippi, LLC, CSRE Properties Vicksburg, LLC, MS Data, LLC, and CleanSpark HQ, LLC. All
intercompany transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation of these entities.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
On March 21, 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2024-01 ("ASU 2024-01"), which clarifies how
an entity determines whether a profits interest or similar award is (1) within the scope of ASC 718 or (2) not a share-based payment arrangement and therefore within the
scope of other guidance. The guidance in ASU 2024-01 applies to all entities that issue profits interest awards as compensation to employees or nonemployees in
exchange for goods or services. ASU 2024-01 is effective for public business entities for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods
within those periods. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2024-01 on its consolidated financial statements.
In December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-08, Intangible - Goodwill and Other - Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60) ("ASC 350-60").
ASC 350-60 requires entities with certain crypto assets to subsequently measure such assets at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in net income in each
reporting period. Crypto assets that meet all the following criteria are within the scope of ASC 350-60:
(1)meet the definition of intangible assets as defined in the Codification;
F-9

# Page 15 of 58

(2)do not provide the asset holder with enforceable rights to or claims on underlying goods, services, or other assets;
(3)are created or reside on a distributed ledger based on blockchain or similar technology;
(4)are secured through cryptography;
(5)are fungible; and
(6)are not created or issued by the reporting entity or its related parties. In addition, entities are required to provide additional disclosures about the holdings of
certain crypto assets.
Bitcoin, which is the sole crypto asset mined by the Company, meets each of these criteria. For all entities, the ASC 350-60 amendments are effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted for both interim and annual financial statements that have
not yet been issued (or made available for issuance). If an entity adopts the amendments in an interim period, it must adopt them as of the beginning of the fiscal year
that includes that interim period. The Company has elected to early adopt the new guidance effective October 1, 2023 resulting in a $4,183 cumulative-effect change to
adjust the Company's bitcoin held on October 1, 2023 with the corresponding entry to beginning accumulated deficit.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, which established a new income tax disclosure requirement in addition to modifying and eliminating certain existing
requirements. Under the new guidance, entities must consistently categorize and provide greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation. Companies
must also further disaggregate income taxes paid. Companies are required to apply the guidance to annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company
does not intend to early adopt this standard.
In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Improvements to Disclosures About Reportable Segments ("ASU 2023-07"), which requires enhanced disclosures
about significant segment expenses. In addition, the amendments enhance interim disclosure requirements, clarify circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple
segment measures of profit or loss, provide new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment, and contain other disclosure
requirements. The new guidance is effective for all public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2023-07 on its consolidated financial
statements.
In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with
Customers, which requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition
date in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as if it had originated the contracts. Under the current business combinations guidance, such
assets and liabilities are recognized by the acquirer at fair value on the acquisition date. The Company adopted the provisions of the accounting pronouncement as of
October 1, 2023 and the new standard did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the six months ended March 31, 2024.
Liquidity
The Company had cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, of $323,052 and bitcoin (measured at fair value) of $357,981 as of March 31, 2024. As shown in
the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements, the Company generated a net income from continuing operations of $152,644 during the six months
ended March 31, 2024. The Company had cash outflows from operating activities from continuing operations, which were $82,525 during the six months ended March
31, 2024. The Company had cash outflows from investing activities from continuing operations due to its investments in capital expenditures in support of its bitcoin
mining operations partially offset by proceeds of bitcoin sales. The Company generated significant cash inflows from financing activities from continuing operations,
primarily attributed to proceeds from equity offerings. The Company generates non-cash consideration in the form of bitcoin, that the Company will sell to generate cash
to funds its operations. During the six months ended March 31, 2024, the Company sold $43,103 of bitcoin at various times during the period and utilized the proceeds
to pay expenditures. However, the Company utilized portions of its equity offerings to offset its cash used in operating and investing activities. The Company has
sufficient cash and bitcoin, which should continue to

support its ongoing operations for the next twelve months. The Company intends to continue generating cash from its access to equity financing through its at-the-
market offering facility (see Note 12).

Use of Estimates
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the
consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates include valuation of derivative
assets, available-for-sale investments, the valuations of share-based awards and the valuations of tangible assets acquired in asset acquisitions. The Company bases its
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions including, but not limited to, the ultimate impact that the ongoing global supply chain issues may have on the Company's
operations.
Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Revenue from Bitcoin Mining
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). The core principle of the revenue standard
is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the
company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The following five steps are applied to achieve that core principle:

1.Identify the contract with the customer
2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract
3. Determine the transaction price
4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract
5. Recognize revenue when the company satisfies a performance obligation
Step 1: The Company operates in the bitcoin mining industry and has identified its bitcoin mining pool operator as its customer. The Company enters into a contract
with a bitcoin mining pool operator (the "customer") to provide hash computation computing power to the mining pools. The contracts are terminable at any time by
either party, the contract term is shorter than a 24-hour period, the contracts are continuously renewed, and there are no penalties for contract termination by either party.
The Company earns revenue based on the Full-Pay-Per-Share ("FPPS") payout method, set forth by our customer. The calculation has specific components which
include network block subsidies, network difficulty, network transaction fees, and pool operating fees. The network block subsidy consists of newly generated bitcoins
and comprises the largest share of the block reward. Network difficulty is the difficulty required to mine a block on the bitcoin network. Network transaction fees consist
of fees paid by the users of the network for the execution of transactions that are included in the block. Pool operating fees are fees charged by the mining pool operator
in order to operate the pool. Network block subsidies are based on the total amount of block subsidies that are expected to be generated on the bitcoin network as a whole
during a 24-hour period beginning at midnight Universal Time Coordinated (UTC) daily, regardless of whether the mining pool operator successfully records a block to
the blockchain. Network difficulty is based on the actual difficulty to mine a block on the bitcoin network. Network transaction fees are based on the total amount of
transaction fees that are actually generated on the blockchain network as a whole during a 24-hour period. Pool operating fees are determined by a fee rate set forth in
the customer's terms of service as a percentage of the actual daily FPPS payout.

The mining pool that the Company contributes its hash computation computing power to only provides services for bitcoin mining and the fees charged during the most
recent quarter were 0.19% of the total daily bitcoin mined. Applying the criteria per ASC 606-10-25-1, the contract arises at the point that the Company provides hash
computation computing power to the mining pool operator, which is considered contract inception, because customer consumption is in tandem with delivery of the
computing power.

Step 2: In order to identify the performance obligations in a contract with a customer, a company must assess the promised goods or services in the contract and identify
each promised good or service that is distinct. A performance

obligation meets ASC 606's definition of a "distinct" good or service (or bundle of goods or services) if both of the following criteria are met:

• The customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (i.e., the good or service is capable of being distinct); and

• The entity's promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (i.e., the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract).

Based on these criteria, the Company has a single performance obligation in providing computing power services (i.e., hashrate) to the mining pool operator (i.e., customer). The performance obligation of computing power services is fulfilled over time, as opposed to a point in time, because the Company provides the hash computation computing power throughout the day and the customer simultaneously obtains control of it and uses the asset to produce bitcoin. The Company has full control of the mining equipment utilized in the mining pool, and if the Company determines it will increase or decrease the hashrate computation computing power of its machines and/or fleet (i.e., for repairs or when power costs are excessive) the computing power provided to the customer will be increased or reduced.

Step 3: The transaction consideration the Company receives is non-cash digital consideration in the form of bitcoin, which the Company measures at fair value as the closing bitcoin price on the date of contract inception as determined by the Company's principal market of bitcoin, Coinbase, and such price is not materially different from using the opening bitcoin price on the date of contract inception. According to the customer contract, daily earnings are calculated from midnight-to-midnight UTC time, and the payout is made one hour later at 1:00 AM UTC time after the preceding midnight-to-midnight 24-hour period. The Company utilizes midnight Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), which is also the midnight of UTC time, since this is consistent with our customer contract in calculating our daily non-cash digital consideration from midnight-to-midnight UTC time.

The transaction consideration the Company earns is all variable since it is dependent on the daily computing power provided by the Company. The Company's bitcoins earned through the contractual payout formula is not known until the Company's hash computation computing power contributed over the daily measurement period is fulfilled over-time between midnight-to-midnight UTC time. The Company's proportionate amount of the network transaction fee rewards earned are calculated at the end of each transactional day (midnight to midnight). There are no other forms of variable considerations, such as discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price concessions, incentives, performance bonuses, penalties, or other similar items.

Step 4: The transaction price is allocated to the single performance obligation upon verification for the provision of hash computation computing power to the mining pool operator. There is a single performance obligation (i.e., hash computation computing power or hashrate) for the contract; therefore, all consideration from the mining pool operator is allocated to this single performance obligation.

Step 5: The Company's performance is complete in transferring the hash computation computing power over time to the customer and the customer obtains control of the contributed hashrate.

There are no deferred revenues or other liability obligations recorded by the Company since there are no payments in advance of the performance, and there are no remaining performance obligations after providing hash computation computing power.

Revenues from Data Center Services

As of September 30, 2023, data center services are no longer provided to external customers. The Company formerly provided data services, such as providing its customers with rack space, power and equipment, and cloud services, such as virtual services, virtual storage, and data backup services, generally based on monthly services provided at a defined price included in the contracts. The performance obligations were the services provided to a customer for the month based on the contract. The transaction price was the price agreed with the customer for the monthly services provided and the revenues are recognized monthly based on the services rendered for the month.

Cost of revenues

The Company includes energy costs and external co-location mining hosting fees in cost of revenues.

Cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash

Cash and cash equivalents include all cash balances and highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. Temporary cash investments are made with high credit quality financial institutions. At times, such investments in U.S. accounts may be in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") insurance limits.

The Company had restricted cash of $2,992 as of March 31, 2024 held in a separate bank account in a certificate of deposit as collateral for utility bonds. The utility bonds are reported in prepaid expense and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Accounts receivable, net

Accounts receivable is comprised of uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms. They are initially recorded at the invoiced amount upon the sale of goods or services to customers and do not bear interest. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluation of its customers, and management closely monitors outstanding receivables based on factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other information. The carrying amount of accounts receivable is reviewed periodically for collectability. If management determines that collection is unlikely, an allowance that reflects management's best estimate of the amounts that will not be collected is recorded.

Accounts receivable, net consists of the following:

| ($ in thousands) | March 31, 2024 | September 30, 2023 |
|---|---|---|
| Accounts Receivable, gross | $ - | $ 353 |
| Provision for doubtful allowances | - | (348 ) |
| Total Accounts Receivable, net | $ - | $ 5 |

Inventory

Inventory balances mainly include supplies inventory used to maintain bitcoin mining facilities and are presented at net realizable value with cost being measured on an average cost method. The Company periodically reviews inventories for unusable and obsolete items. Based on this evaluation, provisions are made to write inventories down to their net realizable value. Inventory was $991 and $809 as of March 31, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.

Prepaid expense and other current assets

The Company records a prepaid expense for costs paid but not yet incurred. Those expected to be incurred within one year are recognized and shown as a short-term prepaid expense. Any costs expected to be incurred outside of one year would be considered other long-term assets.

Other current assets are assets that consist of supplies, deposits and interest receivable. Deposits and interest we expect to receive within one year are shown as short-term. Those we expect to receive outside of one year are shown as other long-term assets.

Concentration Risk

At times throughout the year, the Company may maintain cash balances in certain bank accounts in excess of FDIC limits. The cash balance in excess of the FDIC limits was $22,638 and $28,965 as of March 31, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The accounts offered by the custodian of the Company's bitcoin, which accounts totaled $357,981 and $56,241 as of March 31, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively, are not insured by the FDIC. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.

The Company has certain customers and vendors who individually represented 10% or more of the Company's revenue or capital expenditures. Please refer to Note 16 - Major Customers and Vendors.

## Stock-based compensation

The Company follows the guidelines in FASB Codification Topic ASC 718-10 Compensation-Stock Compensation, which requires companies to measure the cost of employee and non-employee services received in exchange for an award of an equity instrument based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Stock-based compensation expense for stock options is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Company may issue compensatory shares for services including, but not limited to, executive, management, accounting, operations, corporate communication, financial and administrative consulting services. The Company determines the grant date fair value of the options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For equity awards granted by the Company that are contingent upon market-based conditions, the Company fair values these awards using the Monte Carlo simulation model. For discussion of accounting for restricted stock units, please refer Note 14 – Stock-Based Compensation.

## Earnings (loss) per share

The Company reports earnings (loss) per share in accordance with FASB ASC 260-10 Earnings Per Share, which provides for calculation of “basic” and “diluted” earnings per share. Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an entity. The calculation of diluted net income (loss) per share gives effect to common stock equivalents; however, potential common shares are excluded if their effect is antidilutive. All common stock equivalents that consist of options, warrants and restricted stock units were excluded from the calculation of the diluted

Bitcoin, which is non-cash consideration earned by the Company through its mining activities, are included as a reconciling item as a cash outflow within operating activities on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flow. The cash proceeds from the sales of bitcoin are classified based on the holding period in which the bitcoin are held. ASC 350-60 provides guidance on classifying proceeds from bitcoin and concludes that bitcoin converted nearly immediately into cash would qualify as cash flows from operating activities. All other sales would qualify as investing activities. In prior fiscal periods, the Company did not hold its bitcoin for extended periods of time and such sales proceeds prior to the adoption of ASC 350-60 were reported as cash flows from operating activities. Upon adoption, the Company evaluates its sales of bitcoin and records bitcoin sold nearly immediately as operating cash flows and the remainder will be recorded as investing activities. During the six months ended March 31, 2024, all proceeds from bitcoin sales were classified as investing activities.

Fair Value Measurement of financial instruments, derivative asset and contingent consideration

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Company utilizes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of input, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable:

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. These are typically obtained from real-time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets.

Level 2 Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices included for identical or similar assets and liabilities that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets. These are typically obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments.

Level 3 Unobservable inputs, where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability. These inputs reflect the reporting entity’s own beliefs about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, based on the best information available under the circumstances.

The carrying value of cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses and short-term portion of loan payable approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of the instruments. The carrying amount of the Company’s long-term portion of loan payable is also stated at fair value since the stated rate of interest approximates market rates. Management believes the Company is not exposed to significant interest or credit risks arising from these financial instruments.

The following table presents the Company’s financial instruments that are measured and recorded at fair value on the Company’s balance sheets on a recurring basis and their level within the fair value hierarchy as of March 31, 2024 and September 30, 2023:

6.INVESTMENTS
As of March 31, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company had total investments of $1,288 and $3,423, respectively, that are comprised of the following:
Investment in Debt Securities (Preferred Stock) and related Embedded Derivative Asset
On November 5, 2019, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the "SPA"), dated as of November 6, with International Land Alliance, Inc.
("ILAL").
Pursuant to the terms of the SPA with ILAL, the Company purchased 1,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock of ILAL (the "ILAL Preferred Stock") for an aggregate
purchase price of $500, less certain expenses and fees. The Series B Preferred Stock accrue cumulative in-kind accruals at a rate of 12% per annum and were
redeemable on August 6, 2020. The ILAL Preferred Stock can be converted into common stock at a variable rate (refer to the discussion on embedded derivative assets
below). This variable conversion ratio will increase by 10% with the occurrence of certain events. Since the investments were not redeemed on August 6, 2020, they are
now redeemable at the Company's option in cash or into common stock, based on the conversion ratio. The ILAL Preferred Stock is recorded as an available-for-sale
("AFS") debt security and is reported at its estimated fair value as of March 31, 2024. Any change in the fair values of AFS debt securities are reported net of income
tax as an element of Other Comprehensive Income.
The Company accrued no interest, net on our available-for-sale debt securities as of March 31, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The fair value of investment
in Debt Securities was $784 and $726 as of March 31, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company has included gain on change in fair value of preferred
stock amounting to $58 for the six months ended March 31, 2024, and $58 for the six months ended March 31, 2023, as part of Other Comprehensive Income in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).
The Company has deemed this variable conversion feature of the ILAL Preferred Stock as an embedded derivative instrument in accordance with ASC Topic No. 815.
This topic requires the Company to account for the conversion feature on its balance sheet at fair value and account for changes in fair value as a derivative gain or loss.
Unrealized gain or loss on fair valuation of this embedded feature is recognized as income or loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive
Income (Loss).
Total fair value of investment in derivative assets as of March 31, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was $505 and $2,697, respectively. The Company fair values the debt
security as a straight debt instrument based on liquidation value and accrued interest to date. The fair value of the derivative asset is based on the difference in the fair
value of the debt security determined as a straight debt instrument and the fair value of the debt security if converted as of the reporting

through the Agent, or to them, as sales agent and/or principal, on the terms set forth therein.
On January 5, 2024, the Company entered into a new At The Market Offering Agreement (the "2024 ATM Agreement") with the Agent, to create an at-the-market
equity program under which the Company may, but has no obligation to, issue and sell up to the lesser number of shares of the Company's common stock that does not
exceed (a) $500,000 of shares of common stock, or (b) the number of authorized but unissued shares of common stock (less the number of shares of common stock
issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange of any outstanding securities of the Company or otherwise reserved from the Company's authorized capital stock). In
connection with the Company's entry into the 2024 ATM Agreement, the ATM Agreement was terminated. From the inception of the 2024 ATM Agreement through
March 31, 2024, the Company issued and sold 34,075,408 shares under the 2024 ATM Agreement for net proceeds of $487,500.

Legal contingencies

In addition to the legal matters disclosed below, the Company may from time to time be subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course
of its business activities. The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for
amounts above management's expectations, the Company's financial condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.

Bishins v. CleanSpark, Inc. et al.

On January 20, 2021, Scott Bishins ("Bishins"), individually, and on behalf of all others similarly situated (together, the "Class"), filed a class action complaint in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company, its Chief Executive Officer, Zachary Bradford ("Bradford"), and its Chief
Financial Officer at the time, Lori Love ("Love") (such action, the "Class Action"). Subsequent to the filing of the Class Action, Darshan Hasthantra, as lead Plaintiff
(together with Bishins, the "Plaintiffs"), filed an amended complaint (the "Amended Class Complaint"), which named S. Matthew Schultz ("Schultz") as a defendant (the
Company, Bradford and Schultz, collectively, the "Defendants") and no longer named Love as a defendant.

The Amended Class Complaint alleges that, between December 10, 2020 and August 16, 2021 (the "Class Period"), Defendants made material misstatements and
omissions regarding the Company's acquisition of ATL and its anticipated expansion of bitcoin mining operations and seeks: (a) certification of the Class, (b) an award
of compensatory damages to the Class, and (c) an award of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Class in the litigation.

To date, no class has been certified in the Class Action, and the case is moving forward in discovery.

The Company believes that the claims raised in the Amended Class Complaint are without merit. The Company intends to defend itself vigorously against these claims.
At this time, the Company is unable to estimate potential losses, if any, related to the Amended Class Complaint.

Consolidated Ciceri Derivative Actions

On May 26, 2021, Andrea Ciceri ("Ciceri"), derivatively on behalf of CleanSpark, Inc., filed a verified shareholder derivative action (the "Ciceri Derivative Action") in
the United States District Court in the District of Nevada against certain of the Company's officers and directors (collectively referred to as "Ciceri Derivative
Defendants") (Ciceri v. Bradford, Schultz, Love, Beynon, McNeill and Wood). On June 22, 2021, Mark Perna ("Perna") (Ciceri, Perna, and Ciceri Derivative
Defendants collectively referred to as the "Parties") filed a verified shareholder derivative action (the "Perna Derivative Action") in the same court against the same
Ciceri Derivative Defendants, making substantially similar allegations. On June 29, 2021, the Court consolidated the Ciceri Derivative Action with the Perna Derivative
Action in accordance with a stipulation among the Parties (the consolidated case referred to as the "Consolidated Ciceri Derivative Action"). The Consolidated Ciceri
Derivative Action asserts claims of breach of fiduciary duties,

unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, and waste of corporate assets and seeks declaratory relief, monetary damages, and the imposition of adequate corporate governance and internal controls.

In June 2023, the Company’s Board of Directors appointed a special litigation committee (the “SLC”), comprised of independent Directors and represented by independent counsel, to intervene in the case, investigate, evaluate and prosecute as appropriate any and all claims asserted in the Consolidated Ciceri Derivative Action as well as the Consolidated Smith Derivative Actions (defined below). On October 23, 2023, the Court stayed the case until July 23, 2024, pending the completion of the SLC’s investigation.

The Company believes that the claims raised in the Consolidated Ciceri Derivative Action are without merit. The Company intends to both defend itself vigorously against these claims and to vigorously prosecute any counterclaims. At this time, the Company is unable to estimate potential losses, if any, related to the Consolidated Ciceri Derivative Action.

**Consolidated Smith Derivative Actions**

On February 21, 2023, Brandon Smith (“Smith”), derivatively on behalf of CleanSpark, Inc., filed a verified shareholder derivative action in the Eighth Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada in and for Clark County against certain of the Company’s officers and directors (Smith v. Bradford, Love, Schultz, Beynon, McNeill and Wood).

On February 24, 2023, Plaintiff Nicholas Iraci (“Iraci”), derivatively on behalf of CleanSpark, Inc., filed a verified shareholder derivative action in the Eighth Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada in and for Clark County against certain of the Company’s officers and directors (Iraci v. Bradford, Love, Schultz, Beynon, McNeill and Wood).

On March 1, 2023, Plaintiff Eric Atanasoff (“Atanasoff”), derivatively on behalf of CleanSpark, Inc., filed a verified shareholder derivative action in the Eighth Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada in and for Clark County against certain of the Company’s Officers and Directors (Atanasoff v. Bradford, Schultz, Beynon, McNeill, and Wood).

On March 8, 2023, Plaintiff Travis France (“France”), derivatively on behalf of CleanSpark, Inc., filed a verified shareholder derivative action in the Eighth Judicial District Court of the State of Nevada in and for Clark County against certain of the Company’s officers and directors (France v. Bradford, Love, Tadyon, Schultz, Beynon, McNeill and Wood).

Ultimately, each of the aforementioned derivative actions were consolidated into the Smith Derivative Action in the Eighth Judicial District Court of Nevada (the “Consolidated Smith Derivative Actions”).

The operative Consolidated Smith Derivative Actions assert claims of breach of fiduciary duties, unjust enrichment and corporate waste and seek monetary damages, restitution, declaratory relief, litigation costs, and the imposition of adequate corporate governance and internal controls.

On November 6, 2023, the Court stayed the Consolidated Smith Derivative Actions for five months pending the completion of the SLC’s investigation. On March 26, 2024, the SLC moved for an extension of the stay, which was granted on April 23, 2024, through July 8, 2024.

The Company believes that the claims raised in Consolidated Smith Derivative Actions are without merit. The Company intends to both defend itself vigorously against these claims and to vigorously prosecute any counterclaims. At this time, the Company is unable to estimate potential losses, if any, related to the Consolidated Smith Derivative Actions.

<p>As of March 31, 2024, we held 5,021 bitcoins. As of March 31, 2024, the Company held 58% of its bitcoin in cold storage and 42% in hot wallets. The fair value of our bitcoins as of March 31, 2024 was $357,981 on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Effective October 1, 2023, we adopted ASC 350-60, which requires bitcoin to be measured at fair value. See Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for more details on the impact of implementation to the financial statements. As a result, the carrying value of each bitcoin we held at December 31, 2023 and each subsequent reporting period reflects the price of one bitcoin quoted on the active exchange, Coinbase, at the end of the reporting period. Therefore, negative swings in the market price of bitcoin could have a material impact on our earnings and on the carrying value of our bitcoin.</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2023, we held $0.05 in USD Coin (“USDC”), which is a digital currency that is fully backed by U.S. dollar assets, with the value of one USDC coin pegged 1:1 to the value of one U.S. dollar. As of March 31, 2024, the Company did not hold any digital currency other than bitcoin.</p>

<p><b>Discontinued Operations</b></p>
<p>As of June 30, 2022, we deemed our energy operations to be discontinued operations due to our strategic decision to strictly focus on bitcoin mining operations and divest of our energy assets.</p>

Bitcoin Mining Operations

Overview

We operate a fleet of servers commonly known as miners or ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits), which are computer chips customized for a specific use. In the case of bitcoin mining, ASICs calculate the SHA-256 algorithm as efficiently and quickly as possible in order to compete with other miners to solve blocks. Each calculation is a hash, and each machine's computational power is measured in terahash processed per second ("th/s"). One terahash is equal to 1 trillion hashes. The more terahash we produce and contribute into the mining pool, the higher our percentage of the blockchain reward.

There are a variety of factors that influence our ability to mine bitcoin profitability. Our ability to mine profitability is dependent on successfully navigating these fluctuating variables, which include bitcoin's value in USD (the volatility of which is described above), mining difficulty, block rewards and halving, global hashrate, power prices, fleet energy efficiency, data center energy efficiency, and other factors.

The energy efficiency of a mining fleet helps drive profitability, because the most significant direct expense for bitcoin mining is power. We measure efficiency by the watts of energy required to produce each terahash of processing power. We believe we operate a highly efficient fleet of miners. The table below describes our fleet as of March 31, 2024 and 2023 and our miner efficiency and computing power as compared to the global computing power.

(1) Total global hashrate obtained from YCHARTS (https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_network_hash_rate).
(2) Watts of energy required to produce each terahash of processing power.

As of March 31, 2024, our operating hashrate was approximately 2.9% of the total global hashrate, and we received approximately the same percentage of the global blockchain rewards, which as of that date equaled approximately 25-27 bitcoin per day, excluding the bitcoin earned from network transaction fees. Ultimately, in order to mine profitably, we work to ensure that these mining rewards cover our direct operating costs.

 <p>(1) Weighted average cost of mining one bitcoin is calculated by dividing the sum of total energy expense and other direct costs of mining non-energy utilities (owned facilities) and total hosting fee expense (hosted facilities) by the total bitcoin mined during the respective periods.</p>
 <p>(2) Average revenue of each bitcoin mined is calculated by dividing the sum of bitcoin mining revenue for both owned and hosted facilities by the total number of bitcoin mined during the respective periods. We have determined that Coinbase is the principal market for valuing bitcoin transactions and uses the daily closing prices as the source of recording revenue. See the table "Range of intraday bitcoin prices" for information on the range of intraday bitcoin prices for quarterly periods since October 1, 2022.</p>

in determining whether it is economical to operate its mining equipment. As a result, the Company does not consider the sunk costs or depreciation of past capital investments in its historical or
forecasted breakeven analysis. If depreciation and financing costs of our miner fleet were factored into the above cost of mining analysis, the total "cost to mine one bitcoin" would increase by
$13,652 and $10,221 per bitcoin mined for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, bringing the total "cost to mine one bitcoin" to $30,534 and $21,951, respectively. If
depreciation and financing costs of our miner fleet were factored into the above cost of mining analysis for the six months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the total "cost to mine one bitcoin" would
increase by $13,139 and $10,729 per bitcoin mined, respectively, bringing the total "cost to mine one bitcoin" to $28,738 and $23,132, respectively.
Power prices are the most significant cost driver for our wholly owned locations, and energy costs represented 26.6% and 48.4% as expressed as a percentage of bitcoin
mining revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and were 29.7% and 56.9% for the six months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023,
respectively. For our co-locations, hosting fees (which comprise direct operating costs of the third-party operator with energy as the largest cost) and profit sharing were
a combined 62.0% and 61.0% as a percentage of bitcoin mining revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and were 61.7% and
67.5% for the six months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Energy prices can be highly volatile and global events (including the war in Ukraine and the resulting natural gas shortage) caused power prices to increase nationwide
in 2022. All of our wholly owned and operated sites in the State of Georgia and our hosted miners in New York State are currently subject to variable prices and market
rate fluctuations with respect to wholesale power costs. Such prices are governed by power purchase agreements which vary by location, and said prices can change hour
to hour. While this renders energy prices less predictable, it also gives us greater ability and flexibility to actively manage the energy we consume with an eye towards
increasing profitability and energy efficiency. Energy prices are also highly sensitive to weather events, such as winter storms and polar vortices, which increase the
demand for power regionally. When such events occur, we may curtail our operations to avoid using power at increased rates. The average power prices we paid in our
owned facilities for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 were $0.043 and $0.046 per kilowatt hour, respectively, and were $0.043 and $0.052 per kilowatt
hour for the six months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At our hosting facilities, the hosting fee as compared to KWHs utilized in the hosted facilities was
$0.075 and $0.059 per kilowatt hour for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was $0.071 and $0.061 per kilowatt hour for the six months
ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
The management team makes real-time determinations on the need and timing during which we should curtail our operations. We curtail when power prices exceed the
value we would receive for the corresponding fixed bitcoin reward. This means if bitcoin's value decreases or energy prices increase, our curtailment will increase;
likewise, when bitcoin's value increases and energy prices decrease, our curtailment will decrease. The management team manages this decision on an hour-by-hour
basis across all our sites, both wholly owned and hosted.
In the three months ended December 31, 2022, energy prices spiked nationwide due to weather events and, as a result, we curtailed a total of 15% of our fleet, with
December being the month with the greatest curtailment. Our active curtailment strategy allowed us to avoid excessive cost during these events, but it also resulted in
decreased production. The Company did not have significant curtailment during the three months or six months ended March 31, 2024.

Results of continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023
*($ presented in 000's, except for average bitcoin price)*

**Bitcoin mining revenue**

We earned $111,799 in bitcoin mining revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2024, which was an increase of $69,311, or 163%, as compared with $42,488
for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Bitcoin mining revenues are recorded net of bitcoin mining fees charged by our sole mining pool operator that equaled
approximately 0.15% of gross bitcoin mining revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2024, and are determined by two main drivers: quantity of bitcoin mined
and the price of bitcoin on the date the bitcoin is mined. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we mined 2,031 bitcoin with an average bitcoin price of
$55,029 as compared to 1,871 bitcoin with an average bitcoin price of $22,706 during the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in bitcoin mining revenue
for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was attributable to the increase in the bitcoin mined during the period and the increase in the average bitcoin price as
compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in the quantity of bitcoin mined was primarily driven by the increased number of our miners in
operation,

which increased to approximately 133,000 compared to 71,000, an increase of 87% between March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024. The increase in miners in operation increases our hashrate, which is our total computational power, and which when understood in the context of global hashrate, determines how much bitcoin we are able to mine.

Other services revenues

Other services revenues pertain to our former data center operations for which we earned $58 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. In fiscal year 2023 we ceased data center operations.

Cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense)

Our cost of revenues were $34,298 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, an increase of $12,216, or 55%, as compared with $22,082 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. These costs were primarily related to energy costs to operate the miners within our owned facilities, which were $26,228 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, an increase of $10,742, or 69%, as compared to $15,486 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in energy costs was due to the increases in the volume of miners operating in our owned locations. We continually evaluate energy and bitcoin prices and periodically will curtail our mining operations when it is advantageous to do so.

We also incurred hosting fees of $6,565 and profit sharing fees of $1,505 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, an increase of $1,377, or 27%, and increase of $286, or 23%, as compared to $5,188 and $1,219, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The hosting fees and profit sharing fees were primarily the result of our co-location agreement with Coinmint. The hosting fees increased period over period due to increased rates charged per KWH even though KWHs utilized decreased slightly.

Professional fees

Professional fees, which consisted primarily of legal, accounting and consulting fees, were $2,208 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, a decrease of $1,542, or 41%, from $3,750 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Legal expenses were $772 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to $3,339 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. This decrease was primarily attributable to no legal settlements during the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to $2,700 of legal settlements during the three months ended March 31, 2023. Other professional fees, namely accounting and consulting, were $1,432 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to $411 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, representing an increase of $1,021.

Payroll expenses

Payroll expenses were $16,820 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, an increase of $7,070, or 73%, from $9,750 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Our payroll expenses include all compensation related expenses for our employees and mainly include salaries, wages, payroll-related taxes and benefits and non-cash stock-based compensation. Payroll expenses, excluding non-cash stock-based compensation, were $7,023 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, representing an increase of 75% from $4,007 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, mainly attributed to an increase in employee headcount.

We grant stock-based awards to certain employees as a significant portion of our payroll-related costs. Stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash expense, was $9,797 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, an increase of $4,054, or 71%, from $5,743 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in stock based compensation was mainly attributed to the vesting of a certain market-based restricted stock awards in February 2024.

General and administrative expenses

General and administrative expenses increased to $6,819 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 from $4,329 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, representing an increase of $2,490. This increase was primarily attributable

to increases in corporate overhead, including, but not limited to, property taxes and insurance premiums (primarily due to the substantial increase in owned assets).

**Gain on fair value of bitcoin, net**

Gain on fair value of bitcoin, net for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $119,702. As discussed in Notes 2 and Note 5 above, the Company adopted the amendments per ASC 350-60 in the current period; accordingly, we measured crypto assets within the scope of ASC Topic 350-60 - Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Crypto Assets at fair value in accordance with ASC Topic 820 - Fair Value Measurement and included the gains and losses from remeasurement in net income. The gain pertains to the change in bitcoin's fair value from December 31, 2023 to March 31, 2024.

Prior to the adoption of ASC 350-60 - Crypto Assets, bitcoin was classified as indefinite-lived intangible assets and were measured at cost less impairment. Additionally, in the previous guidance, subsequent increases in bitcoin prices are not allowed to be recorded (unrealized gains) unless the bitcoin is sold, at which point the gain is recognized. Accordingly, gains (losses) recognized on fair value of bitcoin in fiscal year 2024 are not comparable to fiscal year 2023.

**Other impairment expense (related to bitcoin)**

Impairment expense in the amount of $194 was recognized for the three months ended March 31, 2023. There was no impairment expense related to bitcoin for the three months ended March 31, 2024 due to the adoption of ASC 350-60 (as described in Note 2 and Note 5) which resulted in measuring bitcoin at fair value and recognizing gains or losses from remeasurement of the assets rather than at cost less impairment. The prior year impairment expense consisted of bitcoin impairments due to the general decrease in bitcoin prices during the year. Decreases in bitcoin prices for periods subsequent to the mining date were recorded as impairment expense. Under ASC 350-60, no impairment expense (prior guidance), subsequent increases in bitcoin prices are not allowed to be recorded (unrealized gains) unless the bitcoin is sold, at which point the gain is recognized.

**Realized gain on sale of bitcoin**

Realized gain on sale of bitcoin was $1,422 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. As described under the heading "Gain on fair value of bitcoin, net" gains (losses) recognized on bitcoin transactions in fiscal year 2024 are not comparable to fiscal year 2023.

**Depreciation and amortization**

Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $32,187 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, from $21,346 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, an increase of $10,841, or 51%. Depreciation expense increased by $10,838, or 52%, during the three months ended March 31, 2024, to $31,666 from $20,828, due to an increase in miners, mining equipment and infrastructure being placed in service during the comparative period. Amortization expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $521, an increase of $3, or 1%, from $518 for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

**Other Income (Expenses)**

Other income, net was $1,209 for the three months ended March 31, 2024, compared with other expense, net of $680 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, which is a change of $1,889. Other income (expenses) for the three months ended March 31, 2024 consisted primarily of interest income of $2,684 as compared to $52 in the same prior year period. This was partially offset by unrealized loss on derivative security of $949 as compared to gain for the same prior year period of $56.

Interest expense in the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased by $273 to $526 from $799 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 due to lower average debt balances during three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023.

Interest income in the three months ended March 31, 2024 increased to $2,684 from $52 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 due to an increase in short-term overnight investments.

**Net income (loss) from Continuing Operations**

Net income from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $126,735 as compared to net loss from continuing operations of $18,166 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, for the reasons discussed above.

**Net income (loss)**

Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $126,735, a fluctuation of $145,195 compared to net loss of $18,460 for the three months ended March 31, 2023, for the reasons stated above.

**Results of continuing operations for the six months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023**
*($ presented in 000's, except for average bitcoin price)*

**Bitcoin mining revenue**

We earned $185,585 in bitcoin mining revenue during the six months ended March 31, 2024, which was an increase of $115,351, or 164%, as compared with $70,234 for the six months ended March 31, 2023. Bitcoin mining revenues are recorded net of bitcoin mining fees charged by our sole mining pool operator that equaled approximately 0.17% of gross bitcoin mining revenues for the six months ended March 31, 2024 and are determined based on the price of bitcoin on the date the bitcoin is mined. During the six months ended March 31, 2024, we mined 4,051 bitcoin with an average bitcoin price of $45,811 as compared to 3,401 bitcoin with an average bitcoin price of $20,651 during the six months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in the bitcoin mined during the six months ended March 31, 2024 was attributable to the increase in the bitcoin mined during the period and the increase in the average bitcoin price as compared to the six months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in the quantity of bitcoin mined was primarily driven by the increased number of our miners in operation, which increased to approximately 133,000 compared to 71,000, an increase of 62,000, between March 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024. The increase in miners in operation increases our hashrate, which is our total computational power, and which when understood in the context of global hashrate, determines how much bitcoin we are able to mine.

**Other services revenues**

Other services revenues pertain to our former data center operations for which we earned $131 for the six months ended March 31, 2023. In fiscal year 2023 we ceased data center operations.

**Cost of revenues (exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense)**

Our cost of revenues were $63,194 for the six months ended March 31, 2024, an increase of $20,696, or 49%, as compared with $42,498 for the six months ended March 31, 2023. These costs were primarily related to energy costs to operate the miners within our owned facilities, which were $48,099 for the six months ended March 31, 2024, an increase of $19,347 or 67% as compared to $28,752 for the six months ended March 31, 2023. The increase in energy costs was due to the increases in the volume of miners operating in our owned locations partially offset by the reduction in the average cost per KWHs, which approximated $0.043/KWH for the six months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to an average cost of $0.052/KWH for the six months ended March 31, 2023. We continually evaluate energy and bitcoin prices and periodically will curtail our mining operations when it is advantageous to do so.

We also incurred hosting fees of $12,140 and profit sharing fees of $2,911 for the six months ended March 31, 2024, an increase of $723, or 6%, and increase of $966, or 94%, as compared to $11,417 and $1,945, respectively, for the six months ended March 31, 2023. The hosting fees and profit sharing fees were primarily the result of our co-location

**Non-GAAP Measure**

We present adjusted EBITDA, which is not a measurement of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). Our non-GAAP "Adjusted EBITDA" excludes (i) impacts of interest, taxes, and depreciation; (ii) our share-based compensation expense, unrealized gains/losses on securities, and, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration with respect to previously completed acquisitions, all of which are non-cash items that we believe are not reflective of our general business performance, and for which the accounting requires management judgment, and the resulting expenses could vary significantly in comparison to other companies; (iii) non-cash impairment losses related to long-lived assets (including goodwill); (iv) legal fees related to litigation and various transactions, which fees management does not believe are reflective of our ongoing operating activities; (v) gains and losses on disposal of assets, the majority of which are related to obsolete or unrepairable machines that

Management believes that providing this non-GAAP financial measure that excludes these items allows for meaningful comparisons between the Company's core business operating results and those of other companies in our industry, and provides the Company and its management with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating its own core business operating results over different periods of time. In addition to management's internal use of non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, management believes that adjusted EBITDA is also useful to investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis. Management believes the foregoing to be the case even though some of the excluded items involve cash outlays and some of them recur on a regular basis (although management does not believe any of such items are normal operating expenses necessary to generate our bitcoin related revenues). For example, we expect that share-based compensation expense, which is excluded from adjusted EBITDA, will continue to be a significant recurring expense over the coming years and is an important part of the compensation provided to certain employees, officers, and directors. Additionally, management does not consider any of the excluded items to be expenses necessary to generate our bitcoin related revenue.

The Company's adjusted EBITDA measure may not be directly comparable to similar measures provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently. The Company's adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income (loss) or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. Although management utilizes internally and presents adjusted EBITDA, we only utilize that measure supplementally and do not consider it to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results.

Accordingly, adjusted EBITDA is not meant to be considered in isolation of, and should be read in conjunction with, the information contained in our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.

The following is a reconciliation of our non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP measure (i.e., net income (loss)) for the periods indicated:

Liquidity and Capital Resources
($ presented in 000's)
Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are working capital, capital expenditures, public company costs and general corporate needs. We expect these needs to
continue as we further develop and grow our business. Our principal sources of liquidity have been and are expected to be our cash and cash equivalents and bitcoin
inventory.
As of March 31, 2024, we had total current assets of $687,771, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, inventory, prepaid expenses and other current assets, bitcoin,
investment in debt security and related derivative asset, current assets held for sale, and total assets in the amount of $1,537,315. Our total current liabilities and total
liabilities as of March 31, 2024 were $55,026 and $74,398, respectively. We had working capital of $632,745 as of March 31, 2024. We sell the bitcoin we mine to fund
operations and to fund capital expenditures. In addition, we have access to equity financing through our At-the-Market offering facility (see Note 12 - Stockholders'
Equity and Note 17 - Subsequent Events to our consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q).
We believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand, together with cash we expect to generate from future operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and
capital expenditure requirements for a period of at least twelve months from the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We are likely to require additional capital
to respond to technological advancements, competitive dynamics or technologies, customer demands, business opportunities, challenges, acquisitions or unforeseen
circumstances and in either the short-term or long-term may determine to engage in equity or debt financings. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing
on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly
limited. In particular, the ongoing impacts of inflation and rising interest rates, and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine have resulted in, and may continue to result
in, significant disruption and volatility in the global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital. If we are unable to raise additional funds when or on the
terms desired, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Material Cash Requirements
We are a party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties. These obligations impact our short-term and long-term
liquidity and capital resource needs. Certain contractual obligations are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of March 31, 2024, while others are considered
future commitments. Our contractual obligations primarily consist of cancelable purchase commitments with various parties to purchase goods or services, primarily
miners and equipment, entered into in the normal course of business and operating leases. For information regarding our other contractual obligations, refer to Note 15 -
Commitments and Contingencies in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2024, and Note 17 - Commitments and Contingencies included
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on December 1, 2023.
We regularly evaluate opportunities to expand our business, including through potential acquisitions of businesses or assets. We will evaluate a variety of sources of
capital in connection with financing any future possible acquisitions, including the incurrence of debt, sales of stock or bitcoin, or using cash on hand. We may also use
the Company's stock as transaction consideration, as we have done in the past.

Operating Activities
Operating activities from continuing operations for the six months ended March 31, 2024 used $82,525 in cash primarily due to net income of $152,644, adjusted by
adding non-cash adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash of depreciation and amortization of $62,034, stock based compensation of $19,750 and subtracting non-
cash bitcoin mining revenues of $185,585 and gain on fair value of bitcoin, net of $155,743. Changes in operating assets and liabilities generating a net total of $18,784
of cash.
Operating activities from continuing operations for the six months ended March 31, 2023 provided $11,127 in cash primarily due to net loss of $47,491, adjusted by
adding non-cash adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash of depreciation and amortization of $40,675, stock based compensation of $11,621 and subtracting non-
cash bitcoin mining revenues of $70,234. The Company also sold bitcoin that it held for a short period of time for net cash proceeds of $76,203. Changes in operating
assets and liabilities generated a total of $817 of cash.
Investing Activities
Investing activities from continuing operations used $231,565 during the six months ended March 31, 2024, as compared with using $113,525 for the six months ended
March 31, 2023. Our payments on miners (including miner deposits) of $208,850 and purchase of fixed assets of $42,986 were the main components of our investing
cash outflow for the six months ended March 31, 2024. This was offset in part by cash proceeds received from the sale of bitcoin of $43,103. Our payments on miner
deposits of $69,238, the acquisition of Mawson of $22,518, and the purchase of fixed assets of $21,769 were the main components of our investing cash outflow for the
six months ended March 31, 2023.
Financing Activities
Cash flows generated from financing activities of continuing operations during the six months ended March 31, 2024 amounted to $608,343, when compared to $89,069
for the six months ended March 31, 2023. Our cash flows from financing activities for the six months ended March 31, 2024 consisted primarily of proceeds from the
underwritten offering of $629,074 partially offset by payments on taxes on shares withheld for net settlement of restricted stock units of $17,139 and payments on loans
in the amount of $3,467. Our cash flows from financing activities for the six months ended March 31, 2023 mainly consisted of proceeds from underwritten offerings of
$99,506 partially offset by payments on loans in the amount of $10,433.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience and on various
other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for the judgments we make about the carrying value of
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Because these estimates can vary depending on the situation, actual results may differ from these
estimates. Making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our
control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial
position and statement of cash flows.
There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as compared to those disclosed in our Form 10-K. For a description of our critical
accounting policies and estimates, see Part I, Item 1, Note 2, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in our notes to the consolidated financial statements in this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Please refer to Note 2 in our unaudited consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for recently adopted accounting
pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
The following discussion about the Company's market risk exposures involves forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in
the forward-looking statements.
Market Price Risk of Bitcoin. The Company holds a significant amount of bitcoin; therefore, it is exposed to the impact of market price changes in bitcoin on its bitcoin
holdings. This exposure would generally manifest itself in the following areas:
•The Company accounts for its bitcoin holdings at fair value and records changes in fair value throughout the periods being reported.
•Declines in the fair market value of bitcoin will impact the cash value that would be realized if the Company were to sell its bitcoin for cash, therefore having a
negative impact on its liquidity.
At March 31, 2024, the Company held approximately 5,021 bitcoins and the fair value of a single bitcoin was approximately $71,300, meaning that the fair value of its
bitcoin holdings on that date was approximately $358 million. A 10% increase or decrease in the fair value of bitcoin as of March 31, 2024, would have increased or
decreased the total cash value that could be realized if the Company were to sell its bitcoin for cash by approximately $35.8 million.
Item 4. Controls and Procedures
Limitation on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in our periodic and current reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and
procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving
the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management
is required to apply judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act).
Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of March 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective due to the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting described below.
Material Weakness and Remediation Plan
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material
misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified
and included in management's assessment:
19

---


# Page 53 of 58

```markdown
• Information and Technology Controls: Certain individual control deficiencies related to information technology (“IT”) general controls and report reviews aggregate into a material weakness, as follows:
o Controls were not fully documented responding to all of the Complementary User Entity Controls forwarded through Software as a Service (SaaS) vendor audit reports in the design and implementation of suggested controls.
o There were not always appropriate IT controls related to information produced by the entity (IPE), including spreadsheets, that are relevant to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

This material weakness did not result in any identified material misstatements to the financial statements, and there were no changes to previously released financial results. Based on this material weakness, management concluded that at March 31, 2024, internal control over financial reporting was not effective.

Our independent registered public accounting firm, MaloneBailey, LLP, has issued an adverse audit report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2023, which begins on page F-1 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on December 1, 2023.

**Remediation**

The Company’s Board of Directors and management take internal control over financial reporting and the integrity of its financial statements seriously. Management has been implementing and continues to implement remedial measures designed to ensure that control deficiencies contributing to the material weakness are remediated, such that these controls are designed, implemented, and operating effectively. The remediation actions include the following:

• establish more specific controls to respond to Complementary User Entity Controls forwarded through SaaS vendor audit reports in the design and implementation of suggested controls;
• expand the management and governance over IT system controls, including the creation of a Systems Analyst position and hiring to fill this position;
• establish more specific controls to gain additional comfort over the completeness and accuracy of IPE, including data used in spreadsheets used in the preparation of consolidated financial statements; and
• implement enhanced internal user access management including provisioning, removal, and periodic review.

We believe that these actions will remediate the material weakness, once management has performed its assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting including the remedial measures described above. The material weakness will not be considered remediated, however, until the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. We expect that the remediation of this material weakness will be fully completed prior to the end of fiscal year 2024.

**Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting**

Other than as described above, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
