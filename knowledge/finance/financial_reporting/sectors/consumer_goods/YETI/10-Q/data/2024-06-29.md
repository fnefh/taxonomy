## CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical or current fact included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements containing words such as "anticipate," "assume," "believe," "can," "have," "contemplate," "continue," "could," "design," "due," "estimate," "expect," "forecast," "goal," "intend," "likely," "may," "might," "objective," "plan," "predict," "project," "potential," "seek," "should," "target," "will," "would," and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operational performance or other events. For example, all statements made relating to our future expectations relating to our recent acquisitions, expected market or macroeconomic environment, estimated and projected costs, expenditures, and growth rates, plans and objectives for future operations, growth, or initiatives, or strategies are forwardlooking statements. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those that are expected and, therefore, you should not unduly rely on such statements. The risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements include but are not limited to: economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions; our ability to maintain and strengthen our brand and generate and maintain ongoing demand and prices for our products; our ability to successfully design, develop and market new products; our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products and our results of operations; our ability to effectively manage our growth and supply chain; our ability to expand into additional consumer markets, and our success in doing so; the success of our international expansion plans; our ability to compete effectively in the outdoor and recreation market and protect our brand; the level of customer spending for our products, which is sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors; our ability to attract and retain skilled personnel and senior management, and to maintain the continued efforts of our management and key employees; our ability to protect our intellectual property; claims by third parties that we have infringed on their intellectual property rights; our involvement in legal or regulatory proceedings or audits; product recalls, warranty liability, product liability, or other claims against us; problems with, or loss of, our third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers, or an inability to obtain raw materials; our ability to timely obtain shipments and deliver products; risks related to manufacturer concentrations; fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials, equipment, labor, and transportation and subsequent manufacturing delays or increased costs; legal, regulatory, economic, political and public health risks associated with international trade; risks associated with tariffs; the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations; our ability to appropriately address emerging environmental, social and governance matters and meet our environmental, social and governance goals; our and our suppliers' and partners' ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations; our relationships with our national, regional, and independent retail partners, who account for a significant portion of our sales; seasonal and quarterly variations in our business; financial difficulties facing our retail partners; the impact of catastrophic events or failures of our information systems, including due to cybersecurity incidents, on our operations and the operations of our manufacturing partners; our ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms; the impact of our indebtedness on our ability to invest in the ongoing needs of our business; impairment to our goodwill or other intangible assets; changes in tax laws or unanticipated tax liabilities; changes to our estimates or judgments; our ability to successfully execute our share repurchase program and its impact on stockholder value and the volatility of the price of our common stock; strategic transactions targeting us; the impact of stockholder activism, takeover proposals, proxy contests or short sellers; disruptions or diversions of our management's attention due to acquisitions or investments in other companies; and the risks and uncertainties described in detail in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023, as such risk factors may be amended, supplemented or superseded from time to time by other reports we file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

These forward-looking statements are made based upon detailed assumptions and reflect management's current expectations and beliefs. While we believe that these assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect actual results.

The forward-looking statements included herein are made only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.

## NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

## 1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

## Organization and Business

Headquartered in Austin, Texas, YETI Holdings, Inc. is a global designer, retailer, and distributor of innovative outdoor products. From coolers and drinkware to bags and apparel, YETI products are built to meet the unique and varying needs of diverse outdoor pursuits, whether in the remote wilderness, at the beach, or anywhere life takes you. We sell our products through our wholesale channel, including independent retailers, national, and regional accounts across a wide variety of end user markets, as well as through our direct-to-consumer ("DTC") channel, which includes our websites, YETI Authorized on the Amazon Marketplace, our corporate sales program, and our retail stores. We operate in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, Hong Kong, China, Singapore, and Japan. In the first quarter of 2024, we acquired Mystery Ranch, LLC, which is a designer and manufacturer of durable load-bearing backpacks, bags, and pack accessories.

The terms "we," "us," "our," "YETI" and "the Company" as used herein and unless otherwise stated or indicated by context, refer to YETI Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

## Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and the rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Accordingly, our financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of our results of operations for the interim periods. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 30, 2023 is derived from the audited financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the year ended December 30, 2023, which should be read in conjunction with these unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.

## Use of Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses during the reporting period and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements. Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be made with certainty. Estimates may change as new events occur, when additional information becomes available and if our operating environment changes. Actual results could differ from our estimates.

## Fiscal Year End

We have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the Saturday closest in proximity to December 31, such that each quarterly period will be 13 weeks in length, except during a 53-week year when the fourth quarter will be 14 weeks. Our fiscal year ending December 28, 2024 ("2024") is a 52-week period. The first quarter of our fiscal year 2024 ended on March 30, 2024, the second quarter ended on June 29, 2024, and the third quarter ends September 28, 2024. Our fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 ("2023") was also a 52-week period. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to our fiscal years and the associated quarters, months, and periods of those fiscal years. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial results presented herein represent the three and six months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023.

## Table of Contents

## Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable are recorded net of estimated credit losses.Our allowance for credit losses was $0.6 million as of June 29, 2024 and $0.5 million as of December 30, 2023, respectively.

## Business Combinations

We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. We allocate the purchase consideration to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination based on their acquisition-date fair values. We use our best estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as the uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances that are initially recorded in connection with a business combination. These estimates are reevaluated and adjusted, if needed, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, and are recorded as adjustments to goodwill. Any adjustments to the acquired assets and liabilities assumed that are identified subsequent to the measurement period are recorded in earnings.

## Inventory

Inventories are comprised primarily of finished goods and are carried at the lower of cost (primarily using weighted-average cost method) or market (net realizable value).At June 29, 2024 and December 30, 2023, inventory reserves were $3.5 million and $2.2 million, respectively.

## Fair Value of Financial Instruments

For financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis, fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset, or pay to transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In the absence of such data, fair value is estimated using internal information consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction. In determining fair value, observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions; preference is given to observable inputs. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:

- Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
- Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.
- Level 3: Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.

Our financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and bank indebtedness. The carrying amount of cash, accounts receivable, and accounts payable, approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying amount of our long-term bank indebtedness approximates fair value based on Level 2 inputs since our senior secured credit facility (the "Credit Facility") carries a variable interest rate that is based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR").

## Supplier Finance Program Obligations

We have a supplier finance program ("SFP") with a financial institution which provides certain suppliers the option, at their sole discretion, to participate in the program and sell their receivables due from us for early payment. Participating eligible suppliers negotiate the terms directly with the financial institution and we have no involvement in establishing those terms nor are we a party to these agreements. Our payments associated with the invoices from the suppliers participating in the SFP are made to the financial institution according to the original invoice. The outstanding payment obligations under the SFP program recorded within accounts payable in our condensed consolidated balance sheets at June 29, 2024 and December 30, 2023 were $105.9 million and $77.3 million, respectively.

## Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50) - Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations , which requires disclosures intended to enhance the transparency of supplier finance programs. The ASU requires buyers in a supplier finance program to disclose sufficient information about the program to allow a user of financial statements to understand the program's nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which is effective for our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. We adopted provisions of this ASU in the first quarter of 2023, with the exception of the amendment on rollforward information, which we adopted in the first quarter of 2024 for our Annual Report for fiscal year 2024. Adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

## Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures . The new standard requires enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses and other segment items and requires companies to provide all annual disclosures about segments in interim periods. All disclosure requirements under ASU 2023-07 are also required for public entities with a single reportable segment. The ASU is effective for the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending December 28, 2024, and subsequent interim periods, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures . The amendments in this update are intended to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures primarily through changes to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the ASU to determine its impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

## 2. ACQUISITIONS

## Mystery Ranch Acquisition

On February 2, 2024, we completed the acquisition of all of the equity interests of Mystery Ranch, LLC ("Mystery Ranch"), a designer and manufacturer of durable load-bearing backpacks, bags, and pack accessories. The total purchase price consideration was $36.2 million, net of a preliminary working capital adjustment and cash acquired of $2.1 million. We are integrating the Mystery Ranch operations and products into our business to further expand our capabilities in our bags category. The acquisition was funded with cash on hand.

We accounted for the acquisition as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting which requires, among other things, assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at fair value as of the acquisition date. The purchase price allocation is preliminary and based upon valuation information available to determine the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, including goodwill, and is subject to change, primarily for final adjustments to net working capital as additional information is obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed at the valuation date.

The following table summarizes the preliminary amounts recorded for acquired assets and assumed liabilities at the acquisition date (in thousands):

Table of Contents

| Cash                                      | 2,051    |
|-------------------------------------------|----------|
| Accounts receivable, net                  | 3,940    |
| Inventory  (1)                            | 17,164   |
| Prepaid expenses and other current assets | 3,858    |
| Property and equipment                    | 512      |
| Operating lease right-of-use assets       | 1,087    |
| Goodwill                                  | 18,600   |
| Intangible assets                         | 5,500    |
| Total assets acquired                     | 52,712   |
| Current liabilities                       | (13,744) |
| Non-current liabilities                   | (753)    |
| Total liabilities assumed                 | (14,497) |
| Net assets acquired                       | 38,215   |

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The goodwill recognized is attributable to the expansion of our backpack and bag offerings and expected synergies from integrating Mystery Ranch's products into our product portfolio. The goodwill will be deductible for income tax purposes. The intangible assets recognized consist of a trade name and customer relationships and have useful lives which range from 8 to 15 years.

Pro forma results are not presented as the impact of this acquisition is not material to our consolidated financial results. The net sales and earnings impact of this acquisition was not material to our consolidated financial results for the three and six months ended June 29, 2024.

## Butter Pat Acquisition

During the three months ended March 30, 2024, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Butter Pat Industries, LLC ("Butter Pat"), a designer and manufacturer of cast iron cookware. We are integrating Butter Pat products into our product portfolio to further expand our capabilities in the cookware category. This transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition and is not material to our consolidated financial statements.

## 3. REVENUE

## Contract Balances

Accounts receivable represent an unconditional right to receive consideration from a customer and are recorded at net invoiced amounts, less an estimated allowance for credit losses.

Contract liabilities are recorded when the customer pays consideration before the transfer of a good to the customer and thus represent our obligation to transfer the good to the customer at a future date. Our contract liabilities include advance cash deposits received from customers for certain customized product orders and unredeemed gift card liabilities. As products are shipped and control transfers, we recognize contract liabilities as revenue.

During the second quarter of 2023, we began issuing gift cards as remedies in connection with our voluntary recalls. We recognize sales from gift cards as they are redeemed for products. As of June 29, 2024, $ 3.4 million of our contract liabilities represented unredeemed gift card liabilities.

The following table provides information about accounts receivable and contract liabilities at the periods indicated (in thousands):

Table of Contents

|                          | June 29, 2024   | December 30, 2023   |

| Accounts receivable, net | 159,050         | 95,774              |
| Contract liabilities     | (9,770)         | (22,437)            |

For the six months ended June 29, 2024, we recognized $22.1 million of revenue that was previously included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the period.

## 6. INCOME TAXES

Income tax expense was $16.9 million and $12.8 million for the three months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023, respectively. The increase in income tax expense was due to higher income before income taxes. The effective tax rate was 25% for each of the three months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023.

Income tax expense was $23.4 million and $16.7 million for the six months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023, respectively. The increase in income tax expense was due to higher income before income taxes. The effective tax rate was 26% for each of the six months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023.

Deferred tax liabilities were $2.2 million as of June 29, 2024 and $4.0 million as of December 30, 2023, which is presented in other liabilities on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet.

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development enacted model rules for a new global minimum tax framework, also known as Pillar Two, and certain governments globally have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, legislation to address Pillar Two. For the six months ended June 29, 2024, the impact of Pillar Two on our consolidated financial statements was not material.

For interim periods, our income tax expense and resulting effective tax rate are based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate adjusted for the effects of items required to be treated as discrete to the period, including changes in tax laws, changes in estimated exposures for uncertain tax positions, and other items.

## 7. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

In May 2024, the Company's stockholders approved the 2024 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan ("2024 Plan"), which replaced the 2018 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2018 Plan"). The 2024 Plan provides for an aggregate limit of up to 3,500,000 shares (subject to certain equitable adjustments and share counting rules as described in the 2024 Plan) of common stock that may be granted pursuant to awards granted under the 2024 Plan. Following the stockholder approval of the 2024 Plan, no new awards will be granted under the 2018 Plan. Awards outstanding under the 2018 Plan or the 2012 Equity and Incentive Compensation Plan (the "2012 Plan") will continue to remain outstanding according to their terms. Shares subject to stock awards granted under the 2018 Plan or the 2012 Plan (a) that expire or terminate without being exercised or (b) that are forfeited under an award, return to the 2024 Plan.

We recognized non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $8.8 million and $7.3 million for the three months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023, respectively. For the six months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023, we recognized stock-based compensation expense of $17.3 million and $14.1 million, respectively. At June 29, 2024, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $65.1 million for all stock-based compensation plans is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years.

Stock-based activity for the six months ended June 29, 2024 is summarized below (in thousands, except per share data):

## 8. EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share includes the effect of all potentially dilutive securities, which include dilutive stock options and other stock-based awards.

The following table sets forth the calculation of earnings per share and weighted-average common shares outstanding at the dates indicated (in thousands, except per share data):

|                                                    | Three Months Ended   | Three Months Ended   | Six Months Ended   | Six Months Ended   |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|

| Net income                                         | $ 50,396             | $ 38,071             | $ 66,251           | $ 48,635           |
| Weighted-average common shares outstanding-basic   | 84,794               | 86,677               | 85,575             | 86,603             |
| Effect of dilutive securities                      | 674                  | 519                  | 738                | 538                |
| Weighted-average common shares outstanding-diluted | 85,468               | 87,196               | 86,313             | 87,141             |
| Earnings per share                                 |                      |                      |                    |                    |
| Basic                                              | $ 0.59               | $ 0.44               | $ 0.77             | $ 0.56             |
| Diluted                                            | $ 0.59               | $ 0.44               | $ 0.77             | $ 0.56             |

Effects of potentially dilutive securities are presented only in periods in which they are dilutive. For each of the three and six months ended June 29, 2024, outstanding stock-based awards representing0.1 million shares of common stock were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share, because their effect would be anti-dilutive. For the three and six months ended July 1, 2023, outstanding stock-based awards representing 0.2 million and 0.3 million shares of common stock, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings, because their effect would be anti-dilutive.

## 9. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

On February 1, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of the Company's common stock (the "Share Repurchase Program").As of Ju ne 29, 2024, $200 million remained under the Share Repurchase Program.

As part of the Share Repurchase Program, on February 27, 2024, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the "ASR Agreement")with G oldman Sachs & Co. LLC ("Goldman Sachs") to repurchase $100 million of YETI's common stock. Pursuant to the ASR Agreement, we made a payment of $10 0 million to Goldman Sachs and received an initial delivery of 1, 998,501 shares of YETI's common stock (the "Initial Shares"), representing 80% of the total shares that we expected to receive under the ASR Agreement based on the market price of $40.03 per share at the time of delivery of the Initial Shares. The ASR Agreement was accounted for as an equity transaction. The fair value of the Initial Shares of $80.0 million was recorded as a treasury stock transaction. The remaining$20.0 million was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.

On April 25, 2024, we settled the transactions contemplated by the ASR Agreement, resulting in a final delivery of642,674 shares (the "Final Shares"). The total number of shares repurchased under the ASR Agreement was 2,641,175 at an average cost per share of $37.86, based on the volume-weighted average share price of YETI's common stock during the calculation period under the ASR Agreement.

At the time they were received, the Initial Shares and Final Shares resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares calculation for basic and diluted earnings per share.

## 10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

## Claims and Legal Proceedings

We are involved in various claims and legal proceedings, some of which are covered by insurance. We believe that our existing claims and proceedings, and the potential losses relating to such contingencies, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

## Product Recall Reserves

In January 2023, we notified the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC") of a potential safety concern regarding the magnet-lined closures of our Hopper M30 Soft Cooler, Hopper M20 Soft Backpack Cooler, and SideKick Dry gear case (the "affected products") and initiated a global stop sale of the affected products. In February 2023, we proposed a voluntary recall of the affected products to the CPSC, and other relevant global regulatory authorities, which we refer to as the "voluntary recalls" herein unless otherwise indicated. In March 2023, we announced separate, voluntary recalls of the affected products in collaboration with the CPSC and subsequently began processing recall claims and returns. As a result, we established reserves as of December 31, 2022, for unsalable inventory on-hand as well as expected future returns, the estimated cost of recall remedies for consumers with affected products, and other recall-related costs.

During 2023, we began processing recall returns and claims, and based on such experience and trends, we reevaluated our assumptions and adjusted our estimated recall expense reserve. In the second quarter of 2023, we updated our recall reserve assumptions, which increased the estimated recall expense reserve by $8.5 million.

The reserve for the estimated product recall costs is included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The reserve for the estimated product recall costs is based on i) expected consumer participation rates; and ii) the estimated costs of the consumer's elected remedy in the recalls, including the estimated cost of either product replacements or gift card elections, logistics costs, and other recall-related costs. The reserve for the estimated product recall expenses was $6.9 million and $13.1 million as of June 29, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively.

The following table summarizes the activity of the reserve for the estimated product recall expenses (in thousands):

## Business Overview

Headquartered in Austin, Texas, YETI is a global designer, retailer, and distributor of innovative outdoor products. From coolers and drinkware to bags and apparel, YETI products are built to meet the unique and varying needs of diverse outdoor pursuits, whether in the remote wilderness, at the beach, or anywhere life takes you.

We have an unwavering commitment to outdoor and recreation communities, and we are relentless in our pursuit of building superior products for people to confidently enjoy life outdoors and beyond.

We distribute our products through a balanced omni-channel platform, consisting of our wholesale and direct-to-consumer ("DTC") channels. In our wholesale channel, we sell our products through select national and regional accounts and an assemblage of independent retail partners throughout the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and Japan, among others. We carefully evaluate and select retail partners that have an image and approach that are consistent with our premium brand and pricing. Our domestic national and regional specialty retailers include Dick's Sporting Goods, REI, Academy Sports + Outdoors, Bass Pro Shops, Ace Hardware, Scheels, and Tractor Supply Company. We sell our products in our DTC channel to customers through our websites and YETI Authorized on the Amazon Marketplace, as well as in our retail stores. Additionally, we offer customized products with licensed trademarks and original artwork through our websites and our corporate sales program. Our corporate sales program offers customized products to corporate customers for a wide-range of events and activities, and in certain instances may also offer products to re-sell. In the first quarter of 2024, we acquired Mystery Ranch, LLC, which is a designer and manufacturer of durable load-bearing backpacks, bags, and pack accessories.

## Product Introductions and Updates

During the first quarter of 2024, we expanded our drinkware offerings with the launch of a new stackable 16 oz. Rambler cup, and introduced new seasonal colorways.

During the second quarter of 2024, we continued the expansion of our drinkware offerings with the launch of our new Rambler French Press in two sizes, our Flask and Shot Glasses, and new seasonal colorways. We also expanded our hard cooler offerings with two new sizes within our Roadie cooler family.

## Acquisitions

During the first quarter of 2024, we completed the acquisitions of Mystery Ranch, LLC ("Mystery Ranch"), a designer and manufacturer of durable load-bearing backpacks, bags, and pack accessories, and Butter Pat Industries, LLC ("Butter Pat"), a designer and manufacturer of cast iron cookware. We are integrating Mystery Ranch and Butter Pat operations and products into our business to further expand our capabilities in the bags and cookware categories. See Note 2- Acquisitions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information about these acquisitions.

## Macroeconomic Conditions

There is significant uncertainty regarding how macroeconomic trends, including sustained high levels of inflation and higher interest rates, will impact consumer demand. While some of these conditions have negatively impacted consumer discretionary spending behavior, we continue to see strong overall demand for our products. We have, however, seen instances of consumer sensitivity to higher price points, which has negatively impacted our financial results.

The recent disruptions of container shipping traffic through the Red Sea and surrounding waterways have continued to negatively affect transit times and freight costs for goods manufactured in Asia and destined to Europe, and to a smaller extent the Americas. In addition to these ongoing disruptions, freight rates increased industry-wide towards the end of the second quarter of 2024. Although such effects have not materially impacted our business to date, the continuation or worsening of these conditions may materially impact our operations and financial results through the remainder of 2024.

A worsening of any of the macroeconomic trends or uncertainties discussed herein may adversely impact our business, operations, and financial results in the future. We will continue to monitor and, if necessary, strive to mitigate the effects of the macroeconomic environment on our business.

## Product Recall Reserves

In January 2023, we notified the Consumer Products Safety Commission ("CPSC") of a potential safety concern regarding the magnet-lined closures of our Hopper M30 Soft Cooler, Hopper M20 Soft Backpack Cooler, and SideKick Dry gear case (the "affected products") and initiated a global stop sale of the affected products. In February 2023, we proposed a voluntary recall of the affected products to the CPSC and other relevant global regulatory authorities. Accordingly, we established reserves for unsalable inventory on-hand, as well as expected future returns, the estimated cost of recall remedies for consumers with affected products, and other recall-related costs as of December 31, 2022.

In March 2023, we announced separate, voluntary recalls of the affected products in collaboration with the CPSC. During the second quarter of 2023, we began processing recall returns and claims and based on such experience and trends, we reevaluated our assumptions and adjusted our estimated recall expense reserve. As a result, we updated our recall reserve assumptions, which increased the estimated recall expense reserve by $8.5 million during the second quarter of 2023.

As a result of the net unfavorable recall reserve adjustment and other incurred costs, for the three and six months ended July 1, 2023, we recorded a reduction to net sales of $24.5 million primarily related to higher estimated future recall-related gift card elections; recorded a benefit in cost of goods sold of $5.1 million and $6.3 million, respectively, primarily related to lower estimated costs of future product replacement remedy elections and logistics costs, and lower recall-related costs; and recorded a benefit in SG&A expenses primarily related to lower estimated other recall-related costs of $10.7 million and $10.5 million, respectively. The total unfavorable impact to operating income related to the recalls was $8.7 million and $7.7 million for the three and six months ended July 1, 2023, respectively.

In addition, our 2023 sales were materially adversely impacted by the stop sales of the affected products. In the fourth quarter of 2023, we introduced our redesigned and improved versions of the affected products.

During 2024, we have not recorded any adjustments to our recall reserves. As a result, the product recall had no impact to our consolidated financial results for the three and six months ended June 29, 2024.

The ultimate impact from the recalls may differ materially from our estimates, and may harm our business, financial condition and results of operation.

## General

## Components of Our Results of Operations

Net Sales. Net sales are comprised of wholesale channel sales to our retail partners and sales through our DTC channel. Net sales in both channels reflect the impact of product returns as well as discounts for certain sales programs or promotions.

We discuss the net sales of our products in our two primary categories: Coolers & Equipment and Drinkware. Our Coolers & Equipment category includes hard coolers, soft coolers, bags, outdoor equipment, and cargo, as well as accessories and replacement parts for these products. Our Drinkware category is primarily composed of our stainless-steel drinkware products and related accessories. In addition, our Other category is primarily comprised of ice substitutes and YETI-branded gear, such as shirts, hats, and other miscellaneous products.

Gross profit. Gross profit reflects net sales less cost of goods sold, which primarily includes the purchase cost of our products from our third-party contract manufacturers, inbound freight and duties, product quality testing and inspection costs, depreciation expense of our molds, tooling, and equipment, and the cost of customizing products. We calculate gross margin as gross profit divided by net sales. Our DTC channel generally generates higher gross margin than our wholesale channel due to differentiated pricing between these channels.

Selling, general, and administrative expenses. Selling, general, and administrative ("SG&A") expenses consist primarily of marketing costs, employee compensation and benefits costs, costs of our outsourced warehousing and logistics operations, costs of operating on third-party DTC marketplaces, professional fees and services, non-cash stock-based compensation, cost of product shipment to our customers, depreciation and amortization expense, and general corporate infrastructure expenses. Our variable expenses, including outbound freight, online marketplace fees, third-party logistics fees, and credit card processing fees, will vary as they are dependent on our sales volume and our channel mix. Our DTC channel variable SG&A costs are generally higher as a percentage of net sales than our wholesale channel distribution costs.

Fiscal Year. We have a 52- or 53-week fiscal year that ends on the Saturday closest in proximity to December 31, such that each quarterly period will be 13 weeks in length, except during a 53-week year when the fourth quarter will be 14 weeks. Our fiscal year ending December 28, 2024 ("2024") is a 52-week period. The first quarter of our fiscal year 2024 ended on March 30, 2024, the second quarter ended on June 29, 2024, and the third quarter ends on September 28, 2024. Our fiscal year ended December 30, 2023 ("2023") was also a 52-week period. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to our fiscal years and the associated quarters, months, and periods of those fiscal years. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial results presented herein represent the three and six months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023.

## Net Sales

Net sales increased $60.9 million, or 15%, to $463.5 million for the three months ended June 29, 2024, compared to the three months ended July 1, 2023. Net sales for the three months ended July 1, 2023 included an unfavorable impact of $24.5 million related to a recall reserve adjustment. Excluding the recall-related impact from the second quarter of 2023, net sales increased $36.4 million, or 9%, due to growth in both our Wholesale and DTC channels. Net sales for the second quarter of 2024 and 2023 also include $2.3 million and $12.5 million, respectively, of sales related to gift card redemptions in connection with recall remedies.

Net sales in our channels were as follows:

- · DTC channel net sales increased $24.0 million, or 11%, to $250.4 million, compared to $226.4 million in the prior year quarter, due to growth in both Coolers & Equipment and Drinkware. DTC channel net sales included an unfavorable impact of $8.1 million in the second quarter of 2023 related to a recall reserve adjustment. DTC channel mix was 54% in the second quarter of 2024 compared to 56% in the second quarter of 2023.
- · Wholesale channel net sales increased $37.0 million, or 21%, to $213.1 million, compared to $176.2 million in the same period last year, due to growth in both Coolers & Equipment and Drinkware. Wholesale channel net sales included an unfavorable impact of $16.4 million in the second quarter of 2023 related to a recall reserve adjustment.

Net sales in our two primary product categories were as follows:

- · Drinkware net sales increased by $13.1 million, or 6%, to $246.5 million, compared to $233.4 million in the prior year quarter, driven by the continued expansion and innovation of our Drinkware product offerings and new seasonal colorways.
- · Coolers & Equipment net sales increased by $49.3 million, or 31%, to $205.9 million, compared to $156.6 million in the same period last year, driven by strong performance in soft coolers and bags. Coolers & Equipment net sales included an unfavorable impact of $24.5 million in the second quarter of 2023 related to a recall reserve adjustment.

Net sales in the U.S. increased $41.0 million, or 12%, to $386.9 million for the three months ended June 29, 2024. Net sales in international locations increased $19.9 million, or 35%, to $76.6 million for the three months ended June 29, 2024. For the three months ended July 1, 2023, net sales in the U.S. and international locations included an unfavorable impact of $23.9 million and $0.6 million, respectively, related to a recall reserve adjustment. Net sales in international locations represented 17% and 14% of total net sales in the second quarter of 2024 and 2023, respectively.

## Gross Profit

Gross profit increased $49.5 million, or 23%, to $264.3 million, compared to $214.8 million in the prior year quarter. Gross profit for the three months ended July 1, 2023 included an unfavorable impact of $19.4 million related to a recall reserve adjustment. Gross margin rate increased 360 basis points to 57.0% from 53.4% in the prior year quarter. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by:

- · lower inbound freight rates, which favorably impacted gross margin by 320 basis points;
- · the favorable impact of an unfavorable reserve adjustment in the prior year quarter associated with our voluntary product recalls, which favorably impacted gross margin in the current year quarter by 150 basis points;
- · lower product costs, which favorably impacted gross margin by 90 basis points;

## Table of Contents

These were partially offset by:

- · the unfavorable impact of the amortization of inventory fair value step-up in connection with the Mystery Ranch acquisition, which unfavorably impacted gross margin by 70 basis points;
- · the unfavorable impact of strategic price decreases on certain hard cooler products implemented during the first quarter of 2024, which unfavorably impacted gross margin by 50 basis points; and
- · other impacts, which unfavorably impacted gross margin by 80 basis points.

## Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses

SG&A expenses increased $32.4 million, or 20%, to $196.9 million for the three months ended June 29, 2024, compared to $164.5 million for the three months ended July 1, 2023. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased 160 basis points to 42.5% for the three months ended June 29, 2024 from 40.9% for the three months ended July 1, 2023. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by:

- · an increase in variable expenses of $7.6 million (decreasing SG&A as a percent of net sales by 20 basis points) primarily associated with higher net sales, and comprised of higher distribution costs including higher third-party logistics fees, online marketplace fees, and outbound freight rates;
- · an increase in non-variable expenses of $14.1 million (decreasing SG&A as a percent of net sales by 90 basis points) comprised of higher employee costs, mainly due to investments in headcount to support future growth and non-cash stock-based compensation expense, investments in marketing expenses and higher information technology expenses; and
- · the unfavorable impact of a favorable $10.7 million reserve adjustment in the prior year quarter associated with our voluntary product recalls (increasing SG&A as a percent of net sales by 270 basis points).

## Non-Operating Expenses

Interest expense, net was $0.5 million for the three months ended June 29, 2024, compared to $0.7 million for the three months ended July 1, 2023, primarily due to an increase in interest income.

Other income was $0.4 million for the three months ended June 29, 2024, compared to other income of $1.2 million for the three months ended July 1, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to lower foreign currency gains on intercompany balances.

Income tax expense was $16.9 million for the three months ended June 29, 2024, compared to $12.8 million for the three months ended July 1, 2023. The increase in income tax expense was due to higher income before income taxes. The effective tax rate was 25% for each of the three months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023.

Net sales in international locations increased $35.7 million, or 34%, to $142.2 million for the six months ended June 29, 2024. For the six months ended July 1, 2023, net sales in the U.S. and international locations included an unfavorable impact of $23.9 million and $0.6 million, respectively, related to a recall reserve adjustment. Net sales in international locations represented 18% and 15% of total net sales in first six months of 2024 and 2023, respectively.

## Gross Profit

Gross profit increased $82.4 million, or 22%, to $459.1 million compared to $376.7 million in the prior year period. Gross profit for the six months ended July 1, 2023 included an unfavorable impact of $18.2 million related to a recall reserve adjustment. Gross margin rate increased 360 basis points to 57.0% from 53.4% in the same period last year. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by:

- · lower inbound freight rates, which favorably impacted gross margin by 340 basis points;
- · lower product costs, which favorably impacted gross margin by 140 basis points; and
- · the favorable impact of an unfavorable reserve adjustment in the prior year quarter associated with our voluntary product recalls, which favorably impacted gross margin in the current year quarter by 70 basis points;

## Table of Contents

These were partially offset by:

- · the unfavorable impact of the amortization of inventory fair value step-up in connection with the Mystery Ranch acquisition, which unfavorably impacted gross margin by 60 basis points;
- · the unfavorable impact of strategic price decreases on certain hard cooler products implemented during the first quarter of 2024, which unfavorably impacted gross margin by 40 basis points;
- · the unfavorable impact of customization costs, on higher customization sales mix, which unfavorably impacted gross margin by 30 basis points; and
- · other impacts, which unfavorably impacted gross margin by 60 basis points.

## Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses

SG&A expenses increased by $54.6 million, or 18%, to $365.9 million for the six months ended June 29, 2024 compared to $311.3 million for the six months ended July 1, 2023. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses increased by 140 basis points to 45.5% for the six months ended June 29, 2024 compared to 44.1% for the six months ended July 1, 2023. The increase in SG&A expenses was primarily driven by:

- · an increase in variable expenses of $13.0 million (decreasing SG&A as a percent of net sales by 10 basis points) primarily associated with higher net sales, and comprised of higher distribution costs, including higher third-party logistics fees, online marketplace fees, and outbound freight rates;
- · an increase in non-variable expenses of $31.1 million (no impact on SG&A as a percent of net sales) comprised of higher employee costs, mainly due to investments in headcount to support future growth and non-cash stock-based compensation expense, investments in marketing expenses, higher information technology expenses, and asset impairments, partially offset by lower warehousing costs; and
- · the unfavorable impact of a favorable $10.5 million reserve adjustment in the prior year period associated with our voluntary product recalls (increasing SG&A as a percent of net sales by 150 basis points).

## Non-Operating Expenses

Interest income, net was $0.1 million for the six months ended June 29, 2024, compared to income expense, net of $1.3 million for the six months ended July 1, 2023, primarily due to an increase in interest income.

Other expense was $3.7 million for the six months ended June 29, 2024, compared to other income of $1.3 million for the six months ended July 1, 2023. The change in other expense was primarily due to foreign currency losses on intercompany balances for the six months ended June 29, 2024 versus foreign currency gains on intercompany balances for the six months ended July 1, 2023.

Income tax expense was $23.4 million for the six months ended June 29, 2024, compared to $16.7 million for the six months ended July 1, 2023. The increase in income tax expense was due to higher income before income taxes. The effective tax rate was 26% for each of the six months ended June 29, 2024 and July 1, 2023.

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

## General

Our cash requirements have principally been for working capital purposes, long-term debt repayments, and capital expenditures. We fund our working capital and our capital investments from cash flows from operating activities, cash on hand, and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"). Pursuant to our recent share repurchase plan described below, we also plan to use cash to repurchase shares of our common stock. We believe that our current operating performance, existing cash position, and borrowings available under our Revolving Credit Facility, will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs and cash requirements over the next twelve months and foreseeable future.

## Current Liquidity

As of June 29, 2024, we had a cash balance of $212.9 million, working capital (excluding cash) of $242.5 million, and $300.0 million of borrowings available under the Revolving Credit Facility.

## Table of Contents

## Credit Facility

Our Credit Facility provides for a $300.0 million Revolving Credit Facility and an $84.4 million term loan ("Term Loan A").

On February 26, 2024, we amended the Credit Facility, leaving the material terms of the Credit Facility substantially unchanged, with the exception of a definitional update and a change to make a Hedging Agreement (as defined in the Credit Facility) entered into in connection with an accelerated share purchase program a permitted Hedging Agreement under the Credit Facility.

At June 29, 2024, we had $80.2 million principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under the Term Loan A under the Credit Facility and no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Term Loan A and the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR") or the Alternate Base Rate (each as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus an applicable rate ranging from 1.75% to 2.50% for Term SOFR-based loans and from 0.75% to 1.50% for Alternate Base Rate-based loans, depending upon our total Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). Additionally, a commitment fee ranging from 0.200% to 0.300%, determined by reference to a pricing grid based on our net leverage ratio, is payable on the average daily unused amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility. The weighted-average interest rate for borrowings under Term Loan A was 7.09% during the three months ended June 29, 2024.

The Credit Facility requires us to comply with certain covenants, including financial covenants regarding our total net leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio. Fluctuations in these ratios may increase our interest expense. Failure to comply with these covenants and certain other provisions of the Credit Facility, or the occurrence of a change of control, could result in an event of default and an acceleration of our obligations under the Credit Facility or other indebtedness that we may incur in the future. At June 29, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility.

## Share Repurchase Program

On February 1, 2024, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million (exclusive of fees and commissions) of YETI's common stock (the "Share Repurchase Program"). The common stock may be repurchased from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market, through various methods, including, but not limited to, open market, privately negotiated, or accelerated share repurchase transactions. Repurchases under the share repurchase program may also be made pursuant to a plan adopted under Rule 10b5-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The timing, manner, price, and actual amount of share repurchases will be determined by management based on various factors, including, but not limited to, stock price, economic and market conditions, other capital allocation needs and opportunities, and corporate and regulatory considerations. YETI has no obligation to repurchase any amount of our common stock, and such repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time. As of June 29, 2024, $200 million remained available under the Share Repurchase Program

As part of the Share Repurchase Program, on February 27, 2024, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (the "ASR Agreement") with Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC ("Goldman Sachs") to repurchase $100 million of YETI's common stock. Pursuant to the ASR Agreement, we made a payment of $100 million to Goldman Sachs and received an initial share delivery of 1,998,501 shares of our common stock. We received a final delivery of an additional 642,674 shares on April 25, 2024. The ASR resulted in the total repurchase of 2,641,175 shares. See Note 9-Stockholders' Equity of the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about the Share Repurchase Program.

## Material Cash Requirements

Other than as disclosed above, there have been no material changes in our material cash requirements for contractual and other obligations, including capital expenditures, as disclosed under "Material Cash Requirements" included in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023 filed with the SEC.

## Operating Activities

Cash flows related to operating activities are dependent on net income, non-cash adjustments to net income, and changes in working capital. The increase in cash used by operating activities during the six months ended June 29, 2024 compared to cash provided by operating activities during the six months ended July 1, 2023 is primarily due to an increase in cash used for working capital, adjusted for non-cash items for the periods compared, partially offset by an increase in net income. The increase in cash used for working capital was primarily due to an increase in inventory.

## Investing Activities

The increase in cash used in investing activities during the six months ended June 29, 2024 was primarily related to the acquisition of Mystery Ranch and increased purchases of intangible assets.

## Financing Activities

The increase in cash used by financing activities during the six months ended June 29, 2024 was primarily driven by repurchases of common stock in connection with our $100 million ASR Agreement.

## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. A discussion of the accounting policies that management considers critical in that they involve significant management judgments and assumptions, require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and because they are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results is included in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023 filed with the SEC. Other than as described below, there have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies.

## Business Combinations

We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. We allocate the purchase consideration to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination based on their acquisition-date fair values. We use our best estimates and assumptions to determine the fair value of tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as the uncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances that are initially recorded in connection with a business combination. These estimates are reevaluated and adjusted, if needed, during the measurement period of up to one year from the acquisition date, and are recorded as adjustments to goodwill. Any adjustments to the acquired assets and liabilities assumed that are identified subsequent to the measurement period are recorded in earnings.

## Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

There have been no material changes to our market risk exposures or management of market risk from those disclosed in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included under Item 7A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 30, 2023.

## Item 4. Controls and Procedures

## Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act")) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding disclosures. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 29, 2024.

## Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

During the quarter ended June 29, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

## Inherent Limitations in Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures, or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake or fraud. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by individuals or groups of persons or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements in our public reports due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.
