# Forward-Looking Statements

This Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Report") contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
All statements other than statements of historical or current fact included in this Report are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements
containing words such as "anticipate," "assume," "believe," "can," "have," "contemplate," "continue," "could," "design," "due," "estimate," "expect,"
"forecast," "goal," "intend," "likely," "may," "might," "objective," "plan," "predict," "project," "potential," "seek," "should," "target," "will," "would," and
other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of the timing or nature of future operational performance or other events. For example, all
statements made relating to growth strategies, the estimated and projected costs, expenditures, and growth rates, plans and objectives for future operations, growth, or
initiatives, or strategies are forward-looking statements. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ
materially from those that are expected and, therefore, you should not unduly rely on such statements. The risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements include but are not limited to the risks and uncertainties listed below under "Risk
Factors Summary" and further described under the heading "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of this Report, as such risk factors may be amended, supplemented or
superseded from time to time by other reports we file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

These forward-looking statements are made based upon detailed assumptions and reflect management's current expectations and beliefs. While we believe that
these assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is
impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect actual results.

The forward-looking statements included herein are made only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking
statement as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law.

# Risk Factors Summary
Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. The following is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our securities speculative
or risky, all of which are more fully described below in the section titled "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of this Report. This summary should be read in conjunction
with the "Risk Factors" section and should not be relied upon as an exhaustive summary of the material risks facing our business. In addition to the following summary,
you should consider the information set forth in the "Risk Factors" section and the other information contained in this Report before investing in our securities.

# Risks Related to Our Business, Operations and Industry
*   A significant reduction in demand for our products could harm our results of operations.
*   If we are unable to successfully design, develop and market new products, our business may be harmed.
*   Our business could be harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast our results of operations and growth rate.
*   We may not be able to effectively manage our growth.
*   Our marketing strategy may not be successful with existing and future customers.
*   If we fail to attract new customers, or fail to do so in a cost-effective manner, we may not be able to increase sales.
*   We may not be successful in expanding into additional markets.
*   If we fail to compete effectively, we could lose our market position.
*   If we are unable to protect or preserve our brand image and proprietary rights, our business may be harmed.
*   Problems with, or loss of, our suppliers or an inability to obtain raw materials could harm our business and results of operations.
*   If we fail to timely and effectively obtain shipments of products from our manufacturers and deliver products to our retail partners and customers, our business
    and results of operations could be harmed.
*   Our business is subject to the risk of manufacturer concentrations.
*   Our results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products.
*   Our business could be harmed if we fail to execute our internal plans to transition our supply chain and certain other business processes to a global scale.
*   Our profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on pricing.
*   Some of our manufacturing relationships are not exclusive, which means that these manufacturers could produce similar products for our competitors.
*   Fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials, equipment, labor, and transportation could cause manufacturing delays or increase our costs.
*   Many of our products are manufactured by third parties outside of the United States, and our business may be harmed by legal, regulatory, economic, political
    and public health risks associated with international trade and those markets.
*   As current tariffs are implemented, or if additional tariffs or other restrictions are placed on foreign imports or any related counter-measures are taken by other
    countries, our business and results of operations could be harmed.
*   A significant portion of our sales are to independent retail partners, and if they cease to carry our current products or choose not to carry new products that we
    develop, our brand as well as our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.
*   We depend on our retail partners to display and present our products to customers, and our failure to maintain and further develop our relationships with our
    retail partners could harm our business.
*   If our plans to increase sales through our DTC channel are not successful, our business and results of operations could be harmed.
*   If we do not successfully implement our future retail store expansion, our growth and profitability could be harmed.
*   Insolvency, credit problems or other financial difficulties that could confront our retail partners could expose us to financial risk.
*   If our independent suppliers and manufacturing partners do not comply with ethical business practices or with applicable laws and regulations, our reputation,
    business, and results of operations could be harmed.
*   We are subject to payment-related risks that may result in higher operating costs or the inability to process payments, either of which could harm our business,
    financial condition and results of operations..
*   Our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new markets may make it more difficult to execute our international expansion plan and
    cause our business and growth to suffer.
*   Our financial results and future growth could be harmed by currency exchange rate fluctuations.
*   We may become involved in legal or regulatory proceedings and audits.
*   Our business involves the potential for product recalls, product liability, and other claims against us, which could adversely affect our reputation, earnings and
    financial condition.
*   Our business is subject to the risk of catastrophic events, and to interruption by problems such as terrorism, public health crises, cyberattacks, or failure of key
    information technology systems.

Table of Contents
*   Our results of operations are subject to seasonal and quarterly variations, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.
*   We are subject to many hazards and operational risks that can disrupt our business, some of which may not be insured or fully covered by insurance.

Risks Related to Market and Global Economic Conditions
*   The COVID-19 pandemic could continue to adversely affect our business, sales, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and our ability to access current or obtain new lending facilities.
*   During a downturn in the economy, consumer purchases of discretionary items are affected, which could materially harm our sales, profitability, and financial condition.

Risks Related to Information Technology and Security
*   We rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.
*   We collect, store, process, and use personal and payment information and other customer data, which subjects us to regulation and other legal obligations related to privacy, information security, and data protection.
*   Any material disruption or breach of our information technology systems or those of third-party partners could materially damage our customer and business partner relationships, and subject us to significant reputational, financial, legal, and operational consequences.

Risks Related to our Financial Condition and Tax Matters
*   We depend on cash generated from our operations to support our growth, and we may need to raise additional capital, which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.
*   Our indebtedness may limit our ability to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and if we are unable to comply with the covenants in our current Credit Facility, our liquidity and results of operations could be harmed.
*   If our goodwill, other intangible assets, or fixed assets become impaired, we may be required to record a charge to our earnings.
*   Changes in tax laws or unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability.
*   The uncertainty regarding the phase-out of LIBOR may negatively impact our operating results.
*   Our results of operations could be harmed if a material number of our retail partners were not able to meet their payment obligations.

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock
*   Any future failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could harm us.
*   Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of the Company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, and limit the market price of our common stock.
*   Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.
*   YETI Holdings, Inc. is a holding company with no operations of its own and, as such, it depends on its subsidiaries for cash to fund its operations and expenses, including future dividend payments, if any.

General Risk Factors
*   Our future success depends on the continuing efforts of our management and key employees, and on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel and senior management.
*   If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect or change significantly, our results of operations could be harmed.
*   We may be the target of strategic transactions, which could divert our management's attention and otherwise disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business.
*   We may acquire or invest in other companies, which could divert our management's attention, result in dilution to our stockholders, and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our results of operations.
*   We may be subject to liability if we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties.

# Our Market
Our premium products are designed for use in a wide variety of activities, from professional to recreational and outdoor to indoor, and can be used year round. As a result, the markets we serve are broad as well as deep, including, for example, outdoor, housewares, home and garden, outdoor living, industrial, and commercial. While our product reach extends into numerous and varied markets, we currently primarily serve the United States outdoor recreation market. The outdoor recreation products market is a large, growing, and diverse economic sector, which includes consumers of all genders, ages, ethnicities, and income levels.

Additionally, we are expanding internationally as we continue to grow our presence in North America (including Canada), Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and Europe. We are expanding internationally by focusing on brand awareness, wholesale expansion, and our DTC channel. We believe there are meaningful growth opportunities by expanding into additional international markets, such as Asia, as many of the market dynamics and premium, performance-based consumer needs that we have successfully identified domestically are also valued in these markets.

# Product Design and Development
We design and develop our products to provide superior performance and functionality in a variety of environments. Our products are carefully designed and rigorously tested to maximize performance while minimizing complexity, allowing us to deliver highly functional products with simple, clean, and distinct designs.

We expand our existing product families and enter new product categories by designing solutions grounded in consumer insights and relevant product knowledge. We use high-quality materials, as well as advanced design and manufacturing processes, to create premium products that redefine consumer expectations and deliver best-in-class product performance. We continue to expand our product line by introducing anchor products, followed by product expansions, such as additional sizes and colorways, and then offering accessories.

To ensure our continued success in bringing category-redefining products to market, our marketing and product development teams collaborate to identify consumer needs and wants to drive our robust product roadmap. We use our purpose-built, state-of-the-art research and development center to generate design prototypes and test performance. We follow a disciplined, stage-gate product development process that is designed to provide consistent quality control while optimizing speed-to-market. We collaborate with our YETI Ambassadors, a diverse group of men and women throughout the United States and select international markets, comprised of world-class anglers, hunters, rodeo cowboys, barbecue pitmasters, surfers, brewmasters, fitness experts, skateboarders, and outdoor adventurers who embody our brand, and industry professionals to test our prototypes and provide feedback that is incorporated into final product designs. Once we approve the final design and specifications of a new product, we partner with global suppliers and specialized manufacturers to produce our products according to our exacting performance and quality standards.

# Marketing
We employ a wide range of marketing tactics and outlets to cultivate our relationships with experts, serious enthusiasts, and everyday consumers, including a combination of traditional, digital, social media, and grass-roots initiatives to support our premium brand, in addition to original short films and high-quality content for YETI.com.

# Supply Chain and Quality Assurance
We manage a global supply chain of highly qualified, third-party manufacturing and logistics partners to produce and distribute our products. The primary raw materials and components used by our manufacturing partners include polyethylene, polyurethane foam, stainless-steel, polyester fabric, zippers, and other plastic materials and coatings. We believe many of these materials are available from multiple vendors. We stipulate approved suppliers and control the specifications for key raw materials used in our products. We do not directly source significant amounts of these raw materials and components.

We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We match sourcing partnerships to deliver flexibility and scalability to support multiple product introductions and evolving channel strategies. Our global supply chain management team researches materials and equipment; qualifies raw material suppliers; vets potential manufacturing partners for advanced production and quality assurance processes; directs our production planning; approves and manages product purchasing plans; and oversees product transportation. Additionally, we work closely with our manufacturing partners regarding product quality and manufacturing process efficiency.

Many of our core products are manufactured in the United States, China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Poland, and Malaysia. In addition, we have third-party
manufacturing partners in Mexico and Italy. To mitigate the concentration risk in our supply chain, we are pursuing a higher diversification of manufacturing partners,
with both sourcing and geographical advantages and, over time, intend to shift the current allocation of production to a better balance among them. See Note 1 of the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further discussion of concentration risk. We hold our manufacturers to rigorous quality and product
conformance standards through frequent involvement and regular product inspecting. We own the molds and tooling used in the production of our products, create and
provide the specifications for our products, and work closely with our manufacturing partners to improve production yields and efficiency. Our manufacturers do not
have unique skills, technologies, processes, or intellectual property that prevent us from migrating to other manufacturing partners.

To ensure consistent product quality, we provide detailed specifications for our products and inspect finished goods both at our manufacturing partners as well as
upon delivery to our United States-based third-party logistics partners. As part of our quality assurance program, we have developed and implemented comprehensive
product inspection and facility oversight processes that are performed by our employees and third-party service providers who work closely with our suppliers to assist
them in meeting our quality standards, as well as improving their production yields and throughput.

**Distribution and Inventory Management**

We utilize global third-party logistics providers to warehouse and distribute finished products from our distribution facilities in Dallas, Texas and Salt Lake City,
Utah to support our domestic operations, and in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the Netherlands to support our international operations. These logistics providers
manage various distribution activities, including product receipt, warehousing, certain limited product inspection activities, and coordinating outbound shipping.

We manage our inventory levels by analyzing product sell-through, forecasting demand, and placing orders with our manufacturers before we receive firm orders
from customers to ensure sufficient availability.

**Competition**

We compete in the large outdoor and recreation market and may compete in other addressable markets. Competition in our markets is based on a number of factors
including product quality, performance, durability, styling, and price, as well as brand image and recognition. We believe that we have been able to compete
successfully on the basis of our brand, superior design capabilities and product development, our DTC capabilities, as well as the breadth of our national, regional, and
independent retail partners.

In the Coolers & Equipment category, we compete against established, well-known, and legacy cooler brands, such as Igloo and Coleman, as well as numerous
other brands and retailers that offer competing products. The popularity of YETI products and the YETI brand has attracted numerous new competitors including
Pelican, OtterBox, and others, as well as private label brands. In the Drinkware category, we compete against well-known brands such as HydroFlask, as well as
numerous other brands and retailers that offer competing products.

The outdoor and recreation market is highly fragmented and highly competitive, with low barriers to entry. Our current and potential competitors may be able to
develop and market superior products or sell similar products at lower prices. These companies may have competitive advantages, including larger retailer bases, global
product distribution, greater financial strength, superior relations with suppliers and manufacturing partners, or larger marketing budgets and brand recognition.

**Seasonality**

We expect our sales to include a seasonal component. We expect our net sales to be highest in the fourth and second quarters, due in part to seasonal holiday
demand, followed by the third quarter, and the lowest sales in the first quarter. We expect that this seasonality will continue to be a factor in our results of operations and
sales. See "Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic" above for additional information of the impact of COVID-19 on our seasonality for 2020.

**Intellectual Property and Brand Protection**

We own the patents, trademarks, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights that support key aspects of our brand and products. We believe these intellectual property rights, combined with our brand, are not only our most distinctive product design, performance, and brand name and reputation, provide us with a competitive advantage. We pursue the registration of our patents, trademarks, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights in various jurisdictions throughout the world where we believe the protection afforded by registration is desirable based on a number of factors, including the nature of the intellectual property, the size of the market, the level of competition, and the cost of maintaining the registration. We also monitor the use of our intellectual property rights by third parties and enforce our rights against those who infringe or otherwise misuse them. We have a significant number of patents and pending patent applications in the United States and in foreign countries. We also have a significant number of trademark registrations and applications in the United States and in foreign countries. We believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our business and we intend to continue to seek intellectual property protection for our new products and processes those who infringe or otherwise misuse them.

**Item 1A. Risk Factors**

Our business, financial condition and operating results can be affected by a number of risks and uncertainties, whether currently known or unknown, any one or more of which could, directly or indirectly, cause our actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past, or from anticipated future, results of operations and financial condition. The risks discussed below are not the only ones facing our business but do represent those risks that we believe are material to us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Risks Related to Our Business, Operations and Industry**

*Our business depends on maintaining and strengthening our brand to generate and maintain ongoing demand for our products, and a significant reduction in such demand could harm our results of operations.*

The YETI name and premium brand image are integral to the growth of our business, as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business. Our success depends on the value and reputation of our brand, which, in turn, depends on factors such as the quality, design, performance, functionality, and durability of our products, the image of our e-commerce platform and retail partner floor spaces, our communication activities, including advertising, social media, and public relations, and our management of the customer experience, including direct interfaces through customer service. Maintaining, promoting, and positioning our brand are important to expanding our customer base and will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide consistent, high-quality customer experiences. We intend to continue making substantial investments in these areas in order to maintain and enhance our brand, and such investments may not be successful. Ineffective marketing, negative publicity, product diversion to unauthorized distribution channels, product or manufacturing defects, counterfeit products, unfair labor practices, and failure to protect the intellectual property rights in our brand are some of the potential threats to the strength of our brand, and those and other factors could rapidly and severely diminish customer confidence in us. Furthermore, these factors could cause our customers to lose the personal connection they feel with the YETI brand. We believe that maintaining and enhancing our brand image in our current markets and in new markets where we have limited brand recognition is important to expanding our customer base. If we are unable to maintain or enhance our brand in current or new markets, our growth strategy and results of operations could be harmed.

*If we are unable to successfully design, develop and market new products, our business may be harmed.*

The market for products in the outdoor and recreation products industry is characterized by new product introductions, frequent enhancements to existing products, and changing customer demands, needs and preferences. To maintain and increase sales, we must continue to introduce new products and improve or enhance our existing products on a timely basis to respond to new and evolving consumer preferences. The success of our new and enhanced products depends on many factors, including anticipating consumer preferences, finding innovative solutions to consumer problems, differentiating our products from those of our competitors, and maintaining the strength of our brand. The design and development of our products is costly, and we typically have several products in development at the same time. Problems in the design or quality of our products, or delays in product introduction, may harm our brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any new products that we develop and market may not generate sufficient revenues to recoup their development, production, marketing, selling and other costs.

*Our business could be harmed if we continue to be unable to accurately forecast our results of operations and growth rate.*

We are not currently able to accurately forecast our results of operations and growth rate. Forecasts are particularly challenging as we expand into new markets and geographies, develop and market new products, and face further uncertainty related to the duration and impact of the rapidly evolving COVID-19 pandemic. Our historical sales, expense levels, and profitability may not be an appropriate basis for forecasting future results.

Failure to accurately forecast our results of operations and growth rate could cause us to make poor operating decisions and we may not be able to adjust in a timely
manner. Consequently, actual results could be materially lower than anticipated. Even if the markets in which we compete expand, we cannot assure you that our
business will grow at similar rates, if at all. Furthermore, if we fail to accurately forecast our results of operations and growth rate, we may experience excess inventory
levels or a shortage of product to deliver to our customers. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale
of excess inventory at discounted prices or in less preferred distribution channels, which could impair our brand image and harm our gross margin. In addition, if we
underestimate our growth rate and the demand for our products, our manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet our customer requirements, and this
could result in delays in the shipment of our products and our ability to recognize revenue, lost sales, as well as damage to our reputation and retailer and distributor
relationships. For more information regarding the inventory risk related to our inability to accurately forecast our results of operations, please see
operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products."
We may not be able to effectively manage our growth.
Our results of
As we grow our business, slower growing or reduced demand for our products, increased competition, a decrease in the growth rate of our overall market, failure to
develop and successfully market new products, or the maturation of our business or market could harm our business. We have made and expect to continue to make
significant investments in our research and development and sales and marketing organizations, expand our operations and infrastructure both domestically and
internationally, design and develop new products, and enhance our existing products. In addition, in connection with operating as a public company, we will incur
significant additional legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. If our sales do not increase at a sufficient rate to offset these
increases in our operating expenses, our profitability may decline in future periods.
We have expanded our operations rapidly since our inception. Our employee headcount and the scope and complexity of our business have increased substantially
over the past several years. We have only a limited history operating our business at its current scale. Our management team does not have substantial tenure working
together. Consequently, if our operations continue to grow at a rapid pace, we may experience difficulties in managing this growth and building the appropriate
processes and controls. Future rapid growth may increase the strain on our resources, and we could experience operating difficulties, including difficulties in sourcing,
logistics, recruiting, maintaining internal controls, marketing, designing innovative products, and meeting consumer needs. If we do not adapt to meet these evolving
challenges, the strength of our brand may erode, the quality of our products may suffer, we may not be able to deliver products on a timely basis to our customers, and
our corporate culture may be harmed.
Our marketing strategy of associating our brand and products with activities rooted in passion for the outdoors may not be successful with existing and future
customers.
We believe that we have been successful in marketing our products by associating our brand and products with activities rooted in passion for the outdoors. To
sustain long-term growth, we must continue to successfully promote our products to consumers who identify with or aspire to these activities, as well as to individuals
who simply value products of uncompromising quality and design. If we fail to continue to successfully market and sell our products to our existing customers or expand
our customer base, our sales could decline, or we may be unable to grow our business.
If we fail to attract new customers, or fail to do so in a cost-effective manner, we may not be able to increase sales.
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to attract customers in a cost-effective manner. In order to expand our customer base, we must appeal to and attract
customers ranging from serious outdoor enthusiasts to individuals who simply value products of uncompromising quality and design. We have made, and we expect that
we will continue to make, significant investments in attracting new customers, including through the use of corporate partnerships, YETI Ambassadors, traditional,
digital, and social media, original YETI films, and participation in, and sponsorship of, community events. Marketing campaigns can be expensive and may not result in
the cost-effective acquisition of customers. Further, as our brand becomes more widely known, future marketing campaigns may not attract new customers at the same
rate as past campaigns. If we are unable to attract new customers, or fail to do so in a cost-effective manner, our growth could be slower than we expect and our business
will be harmed.

Our growth depends, in part, on expanding into additional consumer markets, and we may not be successful in doing so.

We believe that our future growth depends not only on continuing to reach our current core demographic, but also continuing to broaden our retail partner and
customer base. The growth of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to expand our retail partner and customer bases in the United States, as well as
in international markets, including Canada, Australia, Europe, and Japan. In these markets, we may face challenges that are different from those we currently encounter,
including competitive, merchandising, distribution, hiring, and other difficulties. We may also encounter difficulties in attracting customers due to a lack of consumer
familiarity with or acceptance of our brand, or a resistance to paying for premium products, particularly in international markets. We continue to evaluate marketing
efforts and other strategies to expand the customer base for our products. In addition, although we are investing in sales and marketing activities to further penetrate
newer regions, including expansion of our dedicated sales force, we cannot assure you that we will be successful. If we are not successful, our business and results of
operations may be harmed.

*The markets in which we compete are highly competitive and include numerous other brands and retailers that offer a wide variety of products that compete with our
products; if we fail to compete effectively, we could lose our market position.*

The markets in which we compete are highly competitive, with low barriers to entry. Numerous other brands and retailers offer a wide variety of products that
compete with our coolers, drinkware, and other products, including our bags, storage, and outdoor lifestyle products and accessories. Competition in these product
markets is based on a number of factors including product quality, performance, durability, styling, brand image and recognition, and price. We believe that we are one
of the market leaders in both the U.S. premium cooler and U.S. premium stainless-steel drinkware markets. We believe that we have been able to compete successfully
largely on the basis of our brand, superior design capabilities, and product development, as well as on the breadth of our independent retailers, national, and regional
retail partners, and growing DTC channel. Our competitors may be able to develop and market higher quality products that compete with our products, sell their products
for lower prices, adapt to changes in consumers' needs and preferences more quickly, devote greater resources to the design, sourcing, distribution, marketing, and sale of
their products, or generate greater brand recognition than us. In addition, as we expand into new product categories, we have faced, and will continue to face, different
and, in some cases, more formidable competition. We believe many of our competitors and potential competitors have significant competitive advantages, including
longer operating histories, ability to leverage their sales efforts and marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of products, global product distribution, larger and
broader retailer bases, more established relationships with a larger number of suppliers and manufacturing partners, greater brand recognition, larger or more effective
brand ambassador and endorsement relationships, greater financial strength, larger research and development teams, larger marketing budgets, and more distribution and
other resources than we do. Some of our competitors may aggressively discount their products or offer other attractive sales terms in order to gain market share, which
could result in pricing pressures, reduced profit margins, or lost market share. If we are not able to overcome these potential competitive challenges, effectively market
our current and future products, and otherwise compete effectively against our current or potential competitors, our prospects, results of operations, and financial
condition could be harmed.

*Competitors have imitated and attempted to imitate, and will likely continue to imitate or attempt to imitate, our products and technology. If we are unable to protect
or preserve our brand image and proprietary rights, our business may be harmed.*

As our business continues to expand, our competitors have imitated or attempted to imitate, and will likely continue to imitate or attempt to imitate, our product
designs and branding, which could harm our business and results of operations. Only a portion of the intellectual property used in the manufacture and design of our
products is patented, and we therefore rely significantly on trade secrets, trade and service marks, trade dress, and the strength of our brand. We regard our patents, trade
dress, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and similar proprietary rights as critical to our success. We also rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements
with our employees, consultants, suppliers, manufacturers, and others to protect our proprietary rights. Nevertheless, the steps we take to protect our proprietary rights
against infringement or other violation may be inadequate, and we may experience difficulty in effectively limiting the unauthorized use of our patents, trademarks,
trade dress, and other intellectual property and proprietary rights worldwide. We also cannot guarantee that others will not independently develop technology with the
same or similar function to any proprietary technology we rely on to conduct our business and differentiate ourselves from our competitors. Because a significant portion
of our products are manufactured overseas in countries where counterfeiting is more prevalent, and we intend to increase our sales overseas over the long term, we may
experience increased counterfeiting of our products. Unauthorized use or invalidation of our patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade dress, trade secrets, or other
intellectual property or proprietary rights may cause significant damage to our brand and harm our results of operations.

While we actively develop and protect our intellectual property rights, there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected in all countries in which we
conduct our business or that we will prevail when defending our patent, trademark, and proprietary rights. Additionally, we could incur significant costs and management
distraction in pursuing claims to enforce our

intellectual property rights through litigation and defending any alleged counterclaims. If we are unable to protect or preserve the value of our patents, trade dress,
trademarks, copyrights, or other intellectual property rights for any reason, or if we fail to maintain our brand image due to actual or perceived product or service quality
issues, adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation, or other reasons, our brand and reputation could be damaged, and our business may be harmed.

*We rely on third-party contract manufacturers, and problems with, or loss of, our suppliers or an inability to obtain raw materials could harm our business and
results of operations.*

Our products are produced by third-party contract manufacturers. We face the risk that these third-party contract manufacturers may not produce and deliver our
products on a timely basis or at all. We have experienced, and will likely continue to experience, operational difficulties with our manufacturers. These difficulties
include reductions in the availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications and regulatory and customer requirements, insufficient
quality control, failures to meet production deadlines, failure to achieve our product quality standards, increases in costs of materials, and manufacturing or other
business interruptions. The ability of our manufacturers to effectively satisfy our production requirements could also be impacted by manufacturer financial difficulty or
damage to their operations caused by fire, terrorist attack, riots, natural disaster, public health issues such as the current COVID-19 pandemic (or other future pandemics
or epidemics), or other events. The failure of any manufacturer to perform to our expectations could result in supply shortages or delays for certain products and harm
our business. If we experience significantly increased demand, or if we need to replace an existing manufacturer due to lack of performance, we may be unable to
supplement or replace our manufacturing capacity on a timely basis or on terms that are acceptable to us, which may increase our costs, reduce our margins, and harm
our ability to deliver our products on time. For certain of our products, it may take a significant amount of time to identify and qualify a manufacturer that has the
capability and resources to produce our products to our specifications in sufficient volume and satisfy our service and quality control standards.

The capacity of our manufacturers to produce our products is also dependent upon the availability of raw materials. Our manufacturers may not be able to obtain
sufficient supply of raw materials, which could result in delays in deliveries of our products by our manufacturers or increased costs. Any shortage of raw materials or
inability of a manufacturer to produce or ship our products in a timely manner, or at all, could impair our ability to ship orders of our products in a cost-efficient, timely
manner and could cause us to miss the delivery requirements of our customers. As a result, we could experience cancellations of orders, refusals to accept deliveries, or
reductions in our prices and margins, any of which could harm our financial performance, reputation, and results of operations.

*If we fail to timely and effectively obtain shipments of products from our manufacturers and deliver products to our retail partners and customers, our business and
results of operations could be harmed.*

Our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. However, we cannot control all of the factors that might affect the timely
and effective procurement of our products from our third-party contract manufacturers and the delivery of our products to our retail partners and customers.

Our third-party contract manufacturers ship most of our products to our distribution centers in Dallas, Texas, and Salt Lake City, Utah. Our reliance on only two
geographical locations for our distribution centers makes us more vulnerable to natural disasters, weather-related disruptions, accidents, system failures, public health
issues such as the current COVID-19 pandemic (or other future pandemics or epidemics), or other unforeseen events that could delay or impair our ability to fulfill
retailer orders and/or ship merchandise purchased on our website, which could harm our sales. We import our products, and we are also vulnerable to risks associated
with products manufactured abroad, including, among other things: (a) risks of damage, destruction, or confiscation of products while in transit to our distribution
centers; and (b) transportation and other delays in shipments, including as a result of heightened security screening, port congestion, and inspection processes or other
port-of-entry limitations or restrictions in the United States. In order to meet demand for a product, we have chosen in the past, and may choose in the future, to arrange
for additional quantities of the product, if available, to be delivered through air freight, which is significantly more expensive than standard shipping by sea and,
consequently, could harm our gross margins. Failure to procure our products from our third-party contract manufacturers and deliver merchandise to our retail partners
and DTC channel in a timely, effective, and economically viable manner could reduce our sales and gross margins, damage our brand, and harm our business.

We also rely on the timely and free flow of goods through open and operational ports from our suppliers and manufacturers. Labor disputes or disruptions at ports,
our common carriers, or our suppliers or manufacturers could create significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts,
strikes, or other disruptions during periods of significant importing or manufacturing, potentially resulting in delayed or canceled orders by customers, unanticipated
inventory accumulation or shortages, and harm to our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

In addition, we rely upon independent third party and in-house carriers for product shipments from our distribution centers to our retail partners and customers who purchase through our B2B Channel. We may be able to choose a different shipping carrier on a truly limited basis if a feasible alternative shipping route and, depending on the nature of the product, may not result in additional costs or delays. We may not be able to provide products and services to meet our customers' most urgent needs.

Many of our products are manufactured by third parties outside of the United States, and our business may be harmed by legal, regulatory, economic, political and
public health risks associated with international trade and those markets.

Many of our core products are manufactured in China, the Philippines, Vietnam, Taiwan, Poland, and Malaysia. In addition, we have third-party manufacturing
partners in Mexico and Italy. Our reliance on suppliers and manufacturers in foreign markets creates risks inherent in doing business in foreign jurisdictions, including:
(a) the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations, including trade and labor restrictions and laws relating to the importation and taxation of
goods; (b) weaker protection for intellectual property and other legal rights than in the United States, and practical difficulties in enforcing intellectual property and
other rights outside of the United States; (c) compliance with U.S. and foreign laws relating to foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
("FCPA"), the UK Bribery Act 2010 ("Bribery Act"), regulations of the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Controls ("OFAC"), and U.S. anti-money laundering
regulations, which respectively prohibit U.S. companies from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, operating
in certain countries, or maintaining business relationships with certain restricted parties as well as engaging in other corrupt and illegal practices; (d) economic and
political instability and acts of terrorism in the countries where our suppliers are located; (e) public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics, in the countries
where our suppliers and manufacturers are located; (f) transportation interruptions or increases in transportation costs; and (g) the imposition of tariffs or non-tariff
barriers on components and products that we import into the United States or other markets. For example, the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in increased
travel restrictions, supply chain disruptions, and extended shutdown of certain businesses around the globe. This public health crises or any further political
developments or health concerns in markets in which our products are manufactured could result in social, economic and labor instability, adversely affecting the supply
of our products and, in turn, our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, we cannot assure you that our directors, officers, employees,
representatives, manufacturers, or suppliers have not engaged and will not engage in conduct for which we may be held responsible, nor can we assure you that our
manufacturers, suppliers, or other business partners have not engaged and will not engage in conduct that could materially harm their ability to perform their contractual
obligations to us or even result in our being held liable for such conduct. Violations of the FCPA, the Bribery Act, OFAC restrictions, or other export control, anti-
corruption, anti-money laundering, and anti-terrorism laws or regulations may result in severe criminal or civil penalties, and we may be subject to other related
liabilities, which could harm our business, financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.
As current tariffs are implemented, or if additional tariffs or other restrictions are placed on foreign imports or any related counter-measures are taken by other
countries, our business and results of operations could be harmed.
The Trump Administration has put into place tariffs and other trade restrictions and signaled that it may additionally alter trade agreements and terms between the
United States and China, the European Union, Canada, and Mexico, among others, including limiting trade and/or imposing tariffs on imports from such countries. In
addition, China, the European Union, Canada, and Mexico, among others, have either threatened or put into place retaliatory tariffs of their own. As announced tariffs
are implemented, or additional tariffs or other restrictions are placed on foreign imports, including on any of our products manufactured overseas for sale in the United
States, or any related counter-measures are taken by other countries, our business and results of operations may be materially harmed.
Current and additional tariffs have the potential to significantly raise the cost of our products, particularly our Drinkware. In such a case, there can be no assurance
that we will be able to shift manufacturing and supply agreements to non-impacted countries, including the United States, to reduce the effects of the tariffs. As a result,
we may suffer margin erosion or be required to raise our prices, which may result in the loss of customers, negatively impact our results of operations, or otherwise
harm our business. In addition, the imposition of tariffs on products that we export to international markets could make such products more expensive compared to those
of our competitors if we pass related additional costs on to our customers, which may also result in the loss of customers, negatively impact our results of operations, or
otherwise harm our business.

A significant portion of our sales are to independent retail partners. If these independent retail partners cease to carry our current products or choose not to carry
new products that we develop, our brand as well as our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.

For 2019 and 2020, approximately 18% and 14%, respectively, of our gross sales were made to independent retail partners. These retail partners may decide to
emphasize products from our competitors, to redeploy their retail floor space to other product categories, or to take other actions that reduce their purchases of our
products. We do not receive long-term purchase commitments from our independent retail partners, and orders received from our independent retail partners are
cancellable. Factors that could affect our ability to maintain or expand our sales to these independent retail partners include: (a) failure to accurately identify the needs of
our customers; (b) a lack of customer acceptance of new products or product expansions; (c) unwillingness of our independent retail partners and customers to attribute
premium value to our new or existing products or product expansions relative to competing products; (d) failure to obtain shelf space from our retail partners; (e) new,
well-received product introductions by competitors; (f) damage to our relationships with independent retail partners due to brand or reputational harm; (g) delays or
defaults on our retail partners' payment obligations to us; and (h) store closures, decreased foot traffic, recession or other adverse effects resulting from public health
crises such as the current COVID-19 pandemic (or other future pandemics or epidemics).

We cannot assure you that our independent retail partners will continue to carry our current products or carry any new products that we develop. If these risks
occur, they could harm our brand as well as our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, store closures, decreased foot traffic and recession resulting
from the COVID-19 pandemic will adversely affect the performance and will likely adversely affect the financial condition of many of these customers. The foregoing
are expected to have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.

We depend on our retail partners to display and present our products to customers, and our failure to maintain and further develop our relationships with our retail
partners could harm our business.

We sell a significant amount of our products through knowledgeable national, regional, and independent retail partners. Our retail partners service customers by
stocking and displaying our products, explaining our product attributes, and sharing our brand story. Our relationships with these retail partners are important to the
authenticity of our brand and the marketing programs we continue to deploy. Our failure to maintain these relationships with our retail partners or financial difficulties
experienced by these retail partners could harm our business.

We have key relationships with national retail partners. For both 2019 and 2020, one national retail partner accounted for approximately 15% and 9% of our gross
sales, respectively. If we lose any of our key retail partners or any key retail partner reduces its purchases of our existing or new products or its number of stores or
operations or promotes products of our competitors over ours, our sales would be harmed. Because we are a premium brand, our sales depend, in part, on retail partners
effectively displaying our products, including providing attractive space and point of purchase displays in their stores, and training their sales personnel to sell our
products. If our retail partners reduce or terminate those activities, we may experience reduced sales of our products, resulting in lower gross margins, which would
harm our results of operations.

If our plans to increase sales through our DTC channel are not successful, our business and results of operations could be harmed.

For 2020, our DTC channel accounted for 53% of our net sales. Part of our growth strategy involves increasing sales through our DTC channel. However, we have
limited operating experience executing the retail component of this strategy. The level of customer traffic and volume of customer purchases through our country and
region-specific YETI websites or other e-commerce initiatives are substantially dependent on our ability to provide a content-rich and user-friendly website, a hassle-free
customer experience, sufficient product availability, and reliable, timely delivery of our products. If we are unable to maintain and increase customers' use of our
website, allocate sufficient product to our website, and increase any sales through our website, our business, and results of operations could be harmed.

We currently have a limited number of country and region-specific YETI websites and are planning to expand our e-commerce platform to others. These countries
may impose different and evolving laws governing the operation and marketing of e-commerce websites, as well as the collection, storage, and use of information on
customers interacting with those websites. We may incur additional costs and operational challenges in complying with these laws, and differences in these laws may
cause us to operate our business differently, and less effectively, in different territories. If so, we may incur additional costs and may not fully realize the investment in
our international expansion.

If we do not successfully implement our future retail store expansion, our growth and profitability could be harmed.

We have and may continue to expand our existing DTC channel by opening new retail stores. We opened and currently operate retail stores in Austin, Texas,
Charleston, South Carolina, Chicago, Illinois, Dallas, Texas, Denver, Colorado, Ft. Lauderdale, Florida, and West Palm Beach, Florida. Our ability to open new retail
stores in a timely manner and operate them profitably depends on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:

*   our ability to manage the financial and operational aspects of our retail growth strategy, including making appropriate investments in our software systems,
    information technology, and operational infrastructure;
*   our ability to identify suitable locations, including our ability to gather and assess demographic and marketing data to accurately determine customer demand
    for our products in the locations we select;
*   our ability to negotiate favorable lease agreements;
*   our ability to properly assess the potential profitability and payback period of potential new retail store locations;
*   the availability of financing on favorable terms;
*   our ability to secure required governmental permits and approvals and our ability to effectively comply with state and local employment and labor laws, rules,
    and regulations;
*   our ability to hire and train skilled store operating personnel, especially management personnel;
*   the availability of construction materials and labor and the absence of significant construction delays or cost overruns;
*   our ability to provide a satisfactory mix of merchandise that is responsive to the needs of our customers living in the areas where new retail stores are
    established;
*   our ability to establish a supplier and distribution network able to supply new retail stores with inventory in a timely manner;
*   our competitors, or our retail partners, building or leasing stores near our retail stores or in locations we have identified as targets for a new retail store;
*   customer demand for our products;
*   governmental orders requiring adherence to social distancing practices, temporary store closures, or reduced hours; and
*   general economic and business conditions affecting consumer confidence and spending and the overall strength of our business.

We have limited experience in opening retail stores and may not be able to successfully address the risks that they entail. For example, due to the current COVID-
19 pandemic, which resulted in widespread government mandated temporary store closures or reduced hours during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 that may be re-
imposed by governmental authorities in certain geographies to reduce the spread of COVID-19, our ability to implement our full retail store strategy, achieve desired net
sales growth and maintain consistent levels of profitability in our retail stores has been, and continues to be, disrupted. In order to pursue our retail store strategy, we
will be required to expend significant cash resources prior to generating any sales in these stores. We may not generate sufficient sales from these stores to justify these
expenses, which could harm our business and profitability. The substantial management time and resources, which any future retail store expansion strategy may
require, could also result in disruption to our existing business operations, which may decrease our net sales and profitability.

Insolvency, credit problems or other financial difficulties that could confront our retail partners could expose us to financial risk.

We sell to the large majority of our retail partners on open account terms and do not require collateral or a security interest in the inventory we sell them.
Consequently, our accounts receivable with our retail partners are unsecured. Insolvency, credit problems, or other financial difficulties confronting our retail partners
could expose us to financial risk. These actions could expose us to risks if they are unable to pay for the products they purchase from us. Financial difficulties of our
retail partners could also cause them to reduce their sales staff, use of attractive displays, number or size of stores, and the amount of floor space dedicated to our
products. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic caused public health officials to recommend precautions to mitigate the spread of the virus that resulted in widespread
temporary store closures or reduced store hours for our retail partners during the second quarter of 2020. These actions had a significant unfavorable impact on our
wholesale business during the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Significant uncertainty about the ultimate duration and severity of the spread of COVID-19, uncertainties
regarding consumer willingness to visit retail stores during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the future, and the overall economic impact of COVID-19 and the related
impact on consumer confidence and spending may lead to a material reduction in sales of our products by our retail partners. Any reduction in sales by, or loss of, our
current retail partners or customer demand, or credit risks associated with our retail partners, could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

If our independent suppliers and manufacturing partners do not comply with ethical business practices or with applicable laws and regulations, our reputation,
business, and results of operations could be harmed.

Our reputation and our customers' willingness to purchase our products depend in part on our suppliers', manufacturers', and retail partners' compliance with
ethical employment practices, such as with respect to child labor, wages and benefits, forced labor, discrimination, safe and healthy working conditions, and with all
legal and regulatory requirements relating to the conduct of their businesses. We do not exercise control over our suppliers, manufacturers, and retail partners and cannot
guarantee their compliance with ethical and lawful business practices. If our suppliers, manufacturers, or retail partners fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations,
safety codes, employment practices, human rights standards, quality standards, environmental standards, production practices, or other obligations, norms, or ethical
standards, our reputation and brand image could be harmed, and we could be exposed to litigation and additional costs that would harm our business, reputation, and
results of operations.

We are subject to payment-related risks that may result in higher operating costs or the inability to process payments, either of which could harm our business,
financial condition and results of operations..

For our DTC sales, as well as for sales to certain retail partners, we accept a variety of payment methods, including credit cards, debit cards, electronic funds
transfers, electronic payment systems, and gift cards. Accordingly, we are, and will continue to be, subject to significant and evolving regulations and compliance
requirements, including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in increased costs and liability, and reduce the ease of use of
certain payment methods. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, as well as electronic payment systems, we pay interchange and other fees,
which may increase over time. We rely on independent service providers for payment processing, including credit and debit cards. If these independent service providers
become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us, or if the cost of using these providers increases, our business could be harmed. We are also subject to
payment card association operating rules and agreements, including data security rules and agreements, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds
transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data
security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for losses incurred by card issuing banks or customers, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, lose
our ability to accept credit or debit card payments from our customers, or process electronic fund transfers or facilitate other types of payments. Any failure to comply
could significantly harm our brand, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our plans for international expansion may not be successful; our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new markets may make it more
difficult to execute our expansion strategy and cause our business and growth to suffer.

Continued expansion into markets outside the United States, including Canada, Australia, Europe and Japan, is one of our key long-term strategies for the future growth
of our business. There are, however, significant costs and risks inherent in selling our products in international markets, including: (a) failure to effectively translate and
establish our core brand identity, particularly in markets with a less-established heritage of outdoor and recreational activities; (b) time and difficulty in building a
widespread network of retail partners; (c) increased shipping and distribution costs, which could increase our expenses and reduce our margins; (d) potentially lower
margins in some regions; (e) longer collection cycles in some regions; (f) increased competition from local providers of similar products; (g) compliance with foreign
laws and regulations, including taxes and duties, enhanced privacy laws, rules, and regulations, and product liability laws, rules, and regulations, particularly in the
European Union; (h) establishing and maintaining effective internal controls at foreign locations and the associated increased costs; (i) increased counterfeiting and the
uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and practical difficulties of enforcing rights abroad; (j) compliance with anti-bribery, anti-
corruption, sanctions, and anti-money laundering laws, such as the FCPA, the Bribery Act, and OFAC regulations, by us, our employees, and our business partners;
(k) currency exchange rate fluctuations and related effects on our results of operations; (1) economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in foreign
economies and markets; (m) compliance with tax, employment, immigration, and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad; (n) workforce uncertainty in
countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States; (o) business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism,
natural disasters, including earthquakes, typhoons, floods, and fires, public health issues, including the outbreak of a pandemic or contagious disease, such as COVID-
19, or xenophobia resulting therefrom; (p) the imposition of tariffs on products that we import into international markets that could make such products more expensive
compared to those of our competitors; (q) that our ability to expand internationally could be impacted by the intellectual property rights of third parties that conflict with
or are superior to ours; and (r) other costs and risks of doing business internationally.

These and other factors could harm our international operations and, consequently, harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Further, we
may incur significant operating expenses as a result of our planned international expansion, and it may not be successful. We have limited experience with regulatory
environments and market practices internationally, and

The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely affect our business, sales, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and our ability to access capital or obtain new funding facilities.

We have been impacted in Venezuela, SPAIN, USA, COVID-19 has spread globally, including to every state in the United States, and has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments in many countries have implemented various measures to slow the spread of the virus, including travel restrictions, border closures, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders, and shutdowns of non-essential businesses. These measures have disrupted global supply chains, including our own, and have resulted in a significant decrease in demand for our products. The impact includes, but is not limited to:

*   the possibility of material retail store closures or reduced operating hours and/or decreased retail traffic;

In addition, privacy laws, rules, and regulations are constantly evolving in the United States and abroad and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another.
For example, in June 2018, the State of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020, and created new
individual privacy rights for California consumers and place increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling certain personal data. Further, as we expand
internationally, we are subject to additional privacy rules, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, many of which are significantly more
stringent than those in the United States. Complying with these evolving obligations is costly, and any failure to comply could give rise to unwanted media attention and
other negative publicity, damage our customer and consumer relationships and reputation, and result in lost sales, fines, or lawsuits, and may harm our business and
results of operations.

**Any material disruption or breach of our information technology systems or those of third-party partners could materially damage our customer and business
partner relationships and subject us to significant reputational, financial, legal, and operational consequences.**

We depend on our information technology systems, as well as those of third parties, to design and develop new products, operate our website, host and manage our
services, store data, process transactions, respond to user inquiries, and manage inventory and our supply chain as well as to conduct and manage other activities. Any
material disruption or slowdown of our systems or those of third parties that we depend upon, including a disruption or slowdown caused by our or their failure to
successfully manage significant increases in user volume or successfully upgrade our or their systems, system failures, viruses, ransomware, security breaches, or other
causes, could cause information, including data related to orders, to be lost or delayed, which could result in delays in the delivery of products to retailers and customers
or lost sales, which could reduce demand for our products, harm our brand and reputation, and cause our sales to decline. If changes in technology cause our information
systems, or those of third parties that we depend upon, to become obsolete, or if our or their information systems are inadequate to handle our growth, particularly as we
increase sales through our DTC channel, we could damage our customer and business partner relationships and our business and results of operations could be harmed.

We interact with many of our consumers through our e-commerce platforms, and these systems face similar risks of interruption or attack. Consumers increasingly
utilize these services to purchase our products and to engage with our brand. If we are unable to continue to provide consumers a user-friendly experience and evolve our
platform to satisfy consumer preferences, the growth of our e-commerce business and our net revenues may be negatively impacted. If this software contains errors,
bugs or other vulnerabilities which impede or halt service, this could result in damage to our reputation and brand, loss of users, or loss of revenue.

**Risks Related to our Financial Condition and Tax Matters**

**We depend on cash generated from our operations to support our growth, and we may need to raise additional capital, which may not be available on terms
acceptable to us or at all.**

We primarily rely on cash flow generated from our sales to fund our current operations and our growth initiatives. As we expand our business, we will need
significant cash from operations to purchase inventory, increase our product development, expand our manufacturer and supplier relationships, pay personnel, pay for
the increased costs associated with operating as a public company, expand internationally, and further invest in our sales and marketing efforts. If our business does not
generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund these activities and sufficient funds are not otherwise available from our current or future credit facility, we may
need additional equity or debt financing. If such financing is not available to us on satisfactory terms, our ability to operate and expand our business or to respond to
competitive pressures could be harmed. Moreover, if we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, the ownership
of our existing stockholders may be diluted. The holders of new securities may also have rights, preferences or privileges which are senior to those of existing holders of
common stock. In addition, any indebtedness we incur may subject us to covenants that restrict our operations and will require interest and principal payments that could
create additional cash demands and financial risk for us.

Our indebtedness may limit our ability to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and if we are unable to comply with the covenants in our current Credit
Facility, our liquidity and results of operations could be harmed.

As of January 2, 2021, we had $135.0 million principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Facility (as defined in Note 8 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements). The Credit Facility is jointly and severally guaranteed by certain of our wholly-owned material subsidiaries, including YETI
Coolers, LLC, which we refer to as YETI Coolers, and YETI Custom Drinkware LLC, which we refer to as YCD, and any of our future subsidiaries that become
guarantors, together, which we refer to as the Guarantors, and is also secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all of our assets and the assets of the Guarantors, in
each case subject to certain customary exceptions. We may, from time to time, incur additional indebtedness under the Credit Facility.

The Credit Facility places certain conditions on us, including, subject to certain conditions, reductions and exceptions, requiring us to utilize a portion of our cash
flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development
activity, return capital to our stockholders, and other general corporate purposes. Our compliance with this condition may limit our ability to invest in the ongoing needs
of our business. For example, complying with this condition:

*   increases our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;
*   limits our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or markets;
*   makes us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates, as borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at variable rates;
*   limits our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital or other purposes; and
*   potentially places us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.

The Credit Facility places certain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness. However, subject to the qualifications and exceptions in the Credit
Facility, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness under that facility. The Credit Facility also places certain limitations on our ability to enter into certain types
of transactions, financing arrangements and investments, to make certain changes to our capital structure, and to guarantee certain indebtedness, among other things. The
Credit Facility also places certain restrictions on the payment of dividends and distributions and certain management fees. These restrictions limit or prohibit, among
other things, and in each case, subject to certain customary exceptions, our ability to: (a) pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our stock, or make other distributions;
(b) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; (c) sell stock in our subsidiaries; (d) create or incur liens; (e) make acquisitions or investments; (f) transfer or sell certain
assets or merge or consolidate with or into other companies; (g) make certain payments or prepayments of indebtedness subordinated to our obligations under the Credit
Facility; and (h) enter into certain transactions with our affiliates.

The Credit Facility requires us to comply with certain covenants, including financial covenants regarding our total net leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio.
Fluctuations in these ratios may increase our interest expense. Failure to comply with these covenants and certain other provisions of the Credit Facility, or the
occurrence of a change of control, could result in an event of default and an acceleration of our obligations under the Credit Facility or other indebtedness that we may
incur in the future.

If such an event of default and acceleration of our obligations occurs, the lenders under the Credit Facility would have the right to proceed against the collateral we
granted to them to secure such indebtedness, which consists of substantially all of our assets. If the debt under the Credit Facility were to be accelerated, we may not
have sufficient cash or be able to sell sufficient collateral to repay this debt, which would immediately and materially harm our business, results of operations, and
financial condition. The threat of our debt being accelerated in connection with a change of control could make it more difficult for us to attract potential buyers or to
consummate a change of control transaction that would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders.

If our goodwill, other intangible assets, or fixed assets become impaired, we may be required to record a charge to our earnings.

We may be required to record future impairments of goodwill, other intangible assets, or fixed assets to the extent the fair value of these assets falls below their
book value. Our estimates of fair value are based on assumptions regarding future cash flows, gross margins, expenses, discount rates applied to these cash flows, and
current market estimates of value. Estimates used for future sales growth rates, gross profit performance, and other assumptions used to estimate fair value could cause
us to record material non-cash impairment charges, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.

*   provide that certain provisions of our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation may only be amended upon receiving at least 66 2/3% of the votes
    entitled to be cast by holders of all outstanding shares then entitled to vote, voting together as a single class.

These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for
stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, we have opted out of the
provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), which generally prohibit a Delaware corporation from engaging in
any of a broad range of business combinations with any interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an
interested stockholder. However, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides substantially the same limitations as are set forth in Section 203 but
also provides that Cortec and its affiliates and any of their direct or indirect transferees and any group as to which such persons are a party do not constitute "interested
stockholders" for purposes of this provision.

Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for
substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or
our directors, officers, or employees.

Our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that, unless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State
of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for: (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (b) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary
duty owed by any of our stockholders, directors, officers, or other employees to us or to our stockholders; (c) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to the DGCL;
or (d) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The choice of forum provision does not apply to any actions arising under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), or the Exchange Act, or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. The exclusive forum
provision in the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation will not relieve us of our duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and
regulations thereunder, and stockholders of YETI will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations. The choice of forum
provision may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees,
which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision
contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with
resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

YETI Holdings, Inc. is a holding company with no operations of its own and, as such, it depends on its subsidiaries for cash to fund its operations and expenses,
including future dividend payments, if any.

As a holding company, our principal source of cash flow is distributions from our subsidiaries. Therefore, our ability to fund and conduct our business, service our
debt, and pay dividends, if any, depends on the ability of our subsidiaries to generate sufficient cash flow to make upstream cash distributions to us. Our subsidiaries are
separate legal entities, and although they are wholly owned and controlled by us, they have no obligation to make any funds available to us, whether in the form of loans,
dividends, or otherwise. The ability of our subsidiaries to distribute cash to us is also be subject to, among other things, restrictions that may be contained in our
subsidiary agreements (as entered into from time to time), availability of sufficient funds in such subsidiaries and applicable laws and regulatory restrictions. Claims of
any creditors of our subsidiaries generally have priority as to the assets of such subsidiaries over our claims and claims of our creditors and stockholders. To the extent
the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute dividends or other payments to us is limited in any way, our ability to fund and conduct our business, service our debt, and pay
dividends, if any, could be harmed.

General Risk Factors

Our future success depends on the continuing efforts of our management and key employees, and on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel and
senior management.

We depend on the talents and continued efforts of our senior management and key employees. The loss of members of our management or key employees may
disrupt our business and harm our results of operations. Furthermore, our ability to manage further expansion will require us to continue to attract, motivate, and retain
additional qualified personnel. Competition for this type of personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting, integrating, and retaining the personnel
required to grow and operate our business effectively. There can be no assurance that our current management team or any new members of our management team will
be able to successfully execute our business and operating strategies.

If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect or change significantly, our results of operations could be harmed.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and equity and the amount of sales and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our results of operations may be harmed if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors and could result in a decline in our stock price.

We may be the target of strategic transactions, which could divert our management's attention and otherwise disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business.

Other companies may seek to acquire us or enter into other strategic transactions. We will consider, discuss, and negotiate such transactions as we deem appropriate. The consideration of such transactions, even if not consummated, could divert management's attention from other business matters, result in adverse publicity or information leaks, and could increase our expenses.

We may acquire or invest in other companies, which could divert our management's attention, result in dilution to our stockholders, and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our results of operations.

In the future, we may acquire or invest in businesses, products, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our business, enhance our capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various costs and expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated.

In any future acquisitions, we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired personnel, operations, and technologies, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from future acquisitions due to a number of factors, including: (a) an inability to integrate or benefit from acquisitions in a profitable manner; (b) unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition; (c) the incurrence of acquisition-related costs; (d) the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; (e) the loss of our or the acquired business' key employees; or (f) the issuance of dilutive equity securities, the incurrence of debt, or the use of cash to fund such acquisitions.

In addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our results of operations based on this impairment assessment process, which could harm our results of operations.

We may be subject to liability if we infringe upon the intellectual property rights of third parties.

Third parties may sue us for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights. The party claiming infringement might have greater resources than we do to pursue its claims, and we could be forced to incur substantial costs and devote significant management resources to defend against such litigation, even if the claims are meritless and even if we ultimately prevail. If the party claiming infringement were to prevail, we could be forced to modify or discontinue our products, pay significant damages, or enter into expensive royalty or licensing arrangements with the prevailing party. In addition, any payments we are required to make, and any injunction we are required to comply with as a result of such infringement, could harm our reputation and financial results.

**General**

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our business, with widespread closures of retail stores and restaurants, as well as a decline in consumer spending. As a result, our retail sales and certain of our facilities were impacted, we deferred local health producers and we implemented additional safety and cleaning protocols.

**Components of Our Results of Operations**

Net Sales
Net sales increased $178.0 million, or 19%, to $1,091.7 million in 2020 from $913.7 million in 2019. The increase in net sales was driven by growth in our faster
growing DTC channel. DTC channel net sales increased $194.8 million, or 50%, to $580.9 million in 2020 from $386.1 million in 2019, driven by both Drinkware and
Coolers & Equipment categories. Net sales in our DTC channel were favorably impacted by increased demand for outdoor recreation and leisure lifestyle products as the
COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted consumers' views towards how they spend their time experiencing nature and the outdoors as well as more consumers
shopping online while sheltering-in-place, resulting in increased sales volume during the period. As a result, our channel mix significantly shifted towards our DTC
channel from 42% in 2019 to 53% in 2020. Net sales in our wholesale channel decreased $16.8 million, or 3%, to $510.9 million in 2020 from $527.6 million in 2019,
primarily driven by Coolers & Equipment. While wholesale net sales trends returned to positive growth at the end of the second quarter of 2020 and continued during the
second half of the year, the sharp decline of net sales during March and April 2020, as a result of COVID-19 related temporary store closures, adversely impacted the
performance of the wholesale channel.
Net sales in our two primary product categories were as follows:
Drinkware net sales increased $102.3 million, or 19%, to $628.6 million in 2020 from $526.2 million in 2019, primarily driven by the increase in sales
volume, reflecting the continued expansion of our Drinkware product offerings, including the introduction of new colorways and sizes, and strong demand
for customization.
Coolers & Equipment net sales increased $77.7 million, or 21%, to $446.6 million in 2020 from $368.9 million in 2019, primarily driven by the strong
performance of hard coolers, soft coolers, outdoor living products, and cargo.

**Step 1: Identify the content to be converted**

The image contains a page with text and tables. The text is in a clear, readable font, and the tables are well-structured.

**Step 2: Convert the text to Markdown**

To convert the text to Markdown, we need to identify the headings, paragraphs, and other elements. We can use the following syntax:

* Headings: `# Heading`
* Paragraphs: `This is a paragraph of text.`
* Bold text: `**Bold text**`
* Italic text: `*Italic text*`
* Links: `[Link text](http://www.example.com)`
* Images: `![Image alt text](http://www.example.com/image.jpg)`

**Step 3: Convert the tables to HTML**

To convert the tables to HTML, we can use the following syntax:

* Table: `<table>`
* Table row: `<tr>`
* Table cell: `<td>`

We can use the following HTML code to represent the tables:

```
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Column 1</td>
    <td>Column 2</td>
    <td>Column 3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 1, Column 1</td>
    <td>Row 1, Column 2</td>
    <td>Row 1, Column 3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 2, Column 1</td>
    <td>Row 2, Column 2</td>
    <td>Row 2, Column 3</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

**Step 4: Combine the Markdown and HTML code**

Once we have converted the text to Markdown and the tables to HTML, we can combine the code into a single Markdown file.

**Answer**: 

# Heading

This is a paragraph of text.

**Bold text**

## Foreign Currency Risk
Our international sales are primarily denominated in the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, and Euros and any unfavorable movement in the exchange rate between
the U.S. dollar and these currencies could have an adverse impact on our revenue. During 2020, net sales from our international entities accounted for 6% of our
consolidated net sales, and therefore we do not believe exposure to foreign currency fluctuations would have a material impact on our net sales. A portion of our
operating expenses are incurred outside the Unites States and are denominated in foreign currencies, which are also subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign
currency exchange rates. In addition, our suppliers may incur many costs, including labor costs, in other currencies. To the extent that exchange rates move unfavorably
for our suppliers, they may seek to pass these additional costs on to us, which could have a material impact on our gross margin. In addition, a strengthening of the U.S.
dollar may increase the cost of our products to our customers outside of the United States. Our operating results and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due
to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. However, we believe that the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations from operating expenses is not material at this
time as the related costs accounted for 5% of our total operating expenses.

Cash
We maintain our cash in bank deposit accounts which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. We have not historically experienced any losses in such
accounts.
Comprehensive Income
Our comprehensive income is determined based on net income adjusted for gains and losses on foreign currency translation adjustments.
Concentration of Risk
We are exposed to risk due to our concentration of business activity with certain third-party contract manufacturers of our products. For hard coolers, soft coolers,
Drinkware, bags, outdoor living and pet products, our two largest manufacturers comprised approximately 88%, 85%, 77%, 83%, and 95%, respectively, of our
production volume during 2020. For cargo, two manufacturers accounted for all of the production in 2020.
Deferred Financing Fees
Costs incurred upon the issuance of our debt instruments are capitalized and amortized over the life of the associated debt instrument on a straight-line basis, in a
manner that approximates the effective interest method. If the debt instrument is retired before its scheduled maturity date, any remaining issuance costs associated with
that debt instrument are expensed in the same period. Deferred financing fees related to our $450.0 million senior secured Credit Facility are reported in "Long-term
debt, net of current portion" as a direct reduction of the carrying amount of our outstanding long-term debt. At January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, the
amortization of deferred financing fees included in interest expense was $0.9 million and $2.2 million, respectively.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
For financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis, fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset, or pay to
transfer a liability, in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. In the absence of such data, fair value is estimated using internal
information consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction. In determining fair value, observable inputs reflect market data obtained
from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions; preference is given to observable inputs. These two types of inputs create the
following fair value hierarchy:
Level 1: Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.
Level 2: Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-
derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.
Level 3: Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.
Our financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and bank indebtedness. The carrying amount of cash, accounts
receivable, and accounts payable, approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying amount of our long-term bank indebtedness
approximates fair value based on Level 2 inputs since the Credit Facility carries a variable interest rate that is based on the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR").
Foreign Currency Translation and Foreign Currency Transactions
Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment,
a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
For consolidation purposes, the assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using the
exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from
translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill and intangible assets are recorded at cost, or at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. We review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or on an interim basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of such
assets may be below their carrying amount. In conducting our annual impairment test, we first review qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not
that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. If factors indicate that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative
assessment of the asset, analyzing the expected present value of future cash flows to quantify the amount of impairment, if any. We perform our annual impairment tests
in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.
For our annual goodwill impairment tests in the fourth quarters of 2020 and 2019, we performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether the fair value of
goodwill was more likely than not less than the carrying value. Based on economic conditions and industry and market considerations, we determined that it was more
likely than not that the fair value of goodwill was greater than its carrying value; therefore, the quantitative impairment test was not performed. Therefore, we did not
record any goodwill impairment for the years 2020 and 2019.
Our intangible assets consist of indefinite-lived intangible assets, including tradename, trademarks, trade dress, and definite-lived intangible assets such as customer
relationships, trademarks, patents, and other intangibles assets, such as copyrights and domain name. We also capitalize the costs of acquired trademarks, trade dress,
patents and other intangibles, such as copyrights and domain name assets.
In addition, external legal costs incurred in the defense of our patents and trademarks are capitalized when we believe that the future economic benefit of the
intangible asset will be increased, and a successful defense is probable. In the event of a successful defense, the settlements received are netted against the external legal
costs that were capitalized. Capitalized patent and trademark defense costs are amortized over the remaining useful life of the asset. Where the defense of the patent and
trademark maintains rather than increases the expected future economic benefits from the asset, the costs would generally be expensed as incurred. The external legal
costs incurred and settlements received may not occur in the same period. Capitalized costs incurred during 2018, 2019, and 2020 primarily relate to external legal costs
incurred in the defense of our patents and trademarks, net of settlements received.
Income Taxes
We provide for taxes at the enacted rate applicable for the appropriate tax jurisdictions. Deferred taxes are provided on an asset and liability method, which requires
the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of
assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that
some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Tax filing positions are evaluated, and we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing
authorities based on the technical merits of the tax position. Settlements with tax authorities, the expiration of statutes of limitations for particular tax positions, or
obtaining new information on particular tax positions may cause a change to the effective tax rate. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax
benefits in the provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.
Inventories
Inventories are comprised primarily of finished goods and are generally valued at the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is
defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. We make ongoing
estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions.

**Step 1: Identify the content to be converted**

The image contains a page with text and tables. The text is in a clear, readable font, and the tables are well-structured.

**Step 2: Convert the text to Markdown**

To convert the text to Markdown, we need to identify the headings, paragraphs, and other elements. We can use the following syntax:

* Headings: `# Heading`
* Paragraphs: `This is a paragraph of text.`
* Bold text: `**Bold text**`
* Italic text: `*Italic text*`
* Links: `[Link text](http://www.example.com)`
* Images: `![Image alt text](http://www.example.com/image.jpg)`

**Step 3: Convert the tables to HTML**

To convert the tables to HTML, we can use the following syntax:

* Table: `<table>`
* Table row: `<tr>`
* Table cell: `<td>`

We can use the following HTML code to represent the tables:

```
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Column 1</td>
    <td>Column 2</td>
    <td>Column 3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 1, Column 1</td>
    <td>Row 1, Column 2</td>
    <td>Row 1, Column 3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 2, Column 1</td>
    <td>Row 2, Column 2</td>
    <td>Row 2, Column 3</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

**Step 4: Combine the Markdown and HTML code**

Once we have converted the text to Markdown and the tables to HTML, we can combine the code into a single Markdown file.

**Answer**:

5. LEASES
We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at contract inception and determines its classification as an operating or finance lease at lease commencement.
We lease certain retail locations, office space, distribution facilities, manufacturing space, and machinery and equipment. While the substantial majority of these leases
are operating leases, certain machinery and equipment agreements are finance leases. As of January 2, 2021, the initial lease terms of the various leases range from one
to 20 years. ROU lease assets and liabilities associated with leases with an initial term of twelve months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet.

Operating lease assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and operating lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments
arising from the lease. These assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future payments over the lease term at commencement date. We use our
collateralized incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date, including lease term, in determining the present value of future
payments. Our operating leases also typically require payment of real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These components comprise the majority of
our variable lease cost and are excluded from the present value of our lease obligations. In instances where they are fixed, they are included due to our election to
combine lease and non-lease components, with the exception of our distribution facility asset class. Operating lease assets include prepaid lease payments and initial
direct costs and are reduced by lease incentives. Our lease terms generally do not include options to extend or terminate the lease unless it is reasonably certain that the
option will be exercised. Fixed payments may contain predetermined fixed rent escalations. We recognize the related rent expense on a straight-line basis from the
commencement date to the end of the lease term.

On July 15, 2017, we amended the Credit Facility to reset the net leverage ratio covenant for the period ending June 2017 and thereafter, and we incurred
$2.0 million in additional deferred financing fees.
On December 17, 2019, we further amended our Credit Facility which increased the remaining principal amount of Term Loan A from approximately
$298.0 million to $300.0 million; increased the commitments under the revolving credit facility from $100.0 million to $150.0 million; extended the maturity date of
both Term Loan A and the revolving credit facility from May 19, 2021 to December 17, 2024; revised the leverage ratios and reduced the interest rates spreads and
commitment fee payable on the average daily unused amount of the revolving commitment; and revised the scheduled quarterly principal payments of Term Loan A to
1.25% of the remaining aggregate principal amount of Term Loan A for the first year, and 1.875% for the second year and thereafter until the maturity date. As a result
of the amendment, we recognized a $0.6 million loss on modification and extinguishment of debt and we capitalized $2.1 million of new lender and third-party fees in
the fourth quarter of 2019.
In March 2020, we drew down $50.0 million from our $150.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. This action was a precautionary measure to enhance our liquidity
position and to increase available cash on hand in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the second quarter of 2020, we repaid in full the $50.0 million borrowed
under the Revolving Credit Facility. The weighted average interest rate was 2.92% for borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of January 2, 2021, we hadno
borrowings outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility.
The Credit Facility also provides us with the ability to issue up to $20.0 million in letters of credit. While our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our
borrowings outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility, it does reduce the amount available. As of January 2, 2021, we had no outstanding letters of credit.
The weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan A at January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019 was2.72% and 6.05%,
respectively.
The Credit Facility includes customary financial and non-financial covenants limiting, among other things, mergers and acquisitions; investments, loans, and
advances; affiliate transactions; changes to capital structure and the business; additional indebtedness; additional liens; the payment of dividends; and the sale of assets,
in each case, subject to certain customary exceptions. The Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of representations
and warranties, covenant defaults, defaults under other material debt, events of bankruptcy and insolvency, failure of any guaranty or security document supporting the
Credit Facility to be in full force and effect, and a change of control of our business. At January 2, 2021, we were in compliance with the covenants under our Credit
Facility.
Term Loan A
The Term Loan A is a $300.0 million term loan facility, maturing on December 17, 2024. Principal payments of $3.8 million were due quarterly during 2020 and
$5.6 million are due quarterly during 2021 to 2024 with the entire unpaid balance due at maturity. In 2020, we made $150.0 million in voluntary payments on our Term
Loan A from excess cash on hand, and as a result we recorded a $1.1 million loss on prepayments of debt.
Extinguishment of Term Loan B
During the fourth quarter of 2018, we voluntarily repaid in full the $47.6 million principal amount and $0.6 million of accrued interest outstanding under our Term
Loan B, using the net proceeds from our IPO plus additional cash on hand. As a result of the voluntary repayment of the Term Loan B prior to maturity of December 17,
2024, we recorded a loss from extinguishment of debt of $0.7 million relating to the write-off of unamortized financing fees associated with the Term Loan B.
Extinguishment of Rambler On LLC Promissory Note
In May 2019, we repaid in full $1.5 million of remaining principal on the unsecured promissory note to Rambler On LLC and $0.1 million of accrued interest
outstanding thereon, using cash on hand. See Note 12 for additional information.
9. BENEFIT PLAN
We provide a 401(k)-defined contribution plan covering substantially all our employees, which allows for employee contributions and provides for an employer
match. Our contributions totaled approximately $1.1 million, $1.1 million, and $1.0 million for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

# 10. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

In October 2018, the Board adopted the 2018 Plan and ceased granting awards under the YETI Holdings, Inc. 2012 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan, as
amended and restated on June 20, 2018 (the "2012 Plan"). The 2018 Plan became effective with the completion of our IPO. Any remaining shares available for issuance
under the 2012 Plan as of our IPO effectiveness date are not available for future issuance. However, shares subject to stock awards granted under the 2012 Plan (a) that
expire or terminate without being exercised or (b) that are forfeited under an award return to the 2018 Plan.

Subject to adjustments as described above, the 2018 Plan provides for up to4.8 million shares of authorized stock to be awarded as stock options, appreciation
rights, restricted stock ("RSAs"), restricted stock units ("RSUs"), performance shares, performance units, cash incentive awards, and certain other awards based on or
related to shares of our common stock. The 2012 Plan provided for up to 8.8 million shares of authorized stock to be awarded as either stock options or RSUS.

Stock options, RSUs, and RSAs granted generally have a three-year vesting period and vest one-third on the first anniversary of the grant date, and an additional
one-sixth vest on each of the first four six-month anniversaries of the initial vesting date. Stock options have a ten year term. Performance-based restricted stock awards
("PBRSs") vest three years from the grant date, subject to the attainment of certain predetermined performance goals and the grantee remaining employed during the
vesting period. Depending on the estimated probability of attainment of those performance goals, the compensation expense recognized related to the awards could
increase or decrease over the remaining vesting period. Deferred stock units ("DSUs") are issued to non-employee directors in lieu of RSU or certain cash compensation
at the election of the grantee. DSUs generally vest one year from the grant date.

We recognized non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $9.0 million, $52.3 million, and $13.2 million for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. As of
January 2, 2021, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $17.0 million for all stock-based compensation plans is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average period of 1.7 years.

Stock Options Fair Value

The exercise price of options granted under the 2012 Plan and 2018 Plan is equal to the estimated fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant. Before
our IPO in October 2018, we estimated the fair value of our common stock based on the appraisals performed by an independent valuation specialist. Subsequent to our
IPO, we began using the market closing price for our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange.

We estimate the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option-pricing valuation model, which uses the expected option term, stock
price volatility, and the risk-free interest rate. The expected option term assumption reflects the period for which we believe the option will remain outstanding. We
elected to use the simplified method to determine the expected option term, which is the average of the option's vesting and contractual term. Our computation of
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of selected comparable publicly-traded companies over a period equal to the expected term of the option. The risk-
free interest rate reflects the U.S. Treasury yield curve for a similar instrument with the same expected term in effect at the time of the grant.

Stock-Splits
In October 2018, we effected a 0.397-for-1 reverse stock split of all outstanding shares of our common stock. Share and per share data disclosed for all periods has
been retroactively adjusted to reflect the effects of this stock-split. This stock-split was effected prior to the completion of our IPO, discussed below.
Capital Stock Increase
In October 2018, the Board of Directors approved an increase in our authorized capital stock of200.0 million shares of common stock and30.0 million shares of
preferred stock. Following this increase our authorized capital stock of 630.0 million shares consisted of 600.0 million shares of common stock and30.0 million shares
of preferred stock. No shares were issued in connection with the increase in authorized capital stock. This capital stock increase occurred prior to the completion of our
IPO, discussed below.
Initial Public Offering
On October 29, 2018, we completed our IPO of16.0 million shares of our common stock, including2.5 million shares of our common stock sold by us and13.5
million shares of our common stock sold by selling stockholders. The underwriters were also granted an option to purchase up to an additional 2.4 million shares from
the selling stockholders, at the public offering price, less the underwriting discount, for 30 days after October 24, 2018, which the underwriters exercised, in part, on
November 28, 2018 by purchasing an additional 0.9 million shares of common stock at the public offering price of $18.00 per share, less the underwriting discount,
from selling stockholders. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by selling stockholders. Based on our IPO price of $ 18.00 per share, we received net
proceeds of $42.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $2.6 million. Additionally, we incurred offering costs of $4.6 million. On
November 29, 2018, we used the proceeds plus additional cash on hand to repay our Term Loan B as described in Note 8.
Special Dividend
On May 17, 2016, we declared and paid a cash dividend of $5.54 per common share, as a partial return of capital to our stockholders, which totaled $451.3 million
("Special Dividend"). In connection with the Special Dividend, pursuant to anti-dilution provisions in the 2012 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan (2012 Plan"),
the option strike price on outstanding options as of May 17, 2016, was reduced by the lesser of 70% of the original strike price and the per share amount of the Special
Dividend. Any difference between the reduction in strike price and the per share amount of the Special Dividend was paid in cash immediately for vested options. For
holders of unvested options as of May 17, 2016, we were required to pay a $7.9 million dividend which accrues over the requisite service period as the options vest
("Options Dividend").
We paid $0.6 million and $2.5 million related to the Options Dividend to vested option holders in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Options Dividend was paid in
full on September 28, 2019.
12. RELATED-PARTY AGREEMENTS
In 2012, we entered into a management services agreement with Cortec, our majority stockholder, that provides for a management fee to be based onl.0% of total
sales not to exceed $750,000 annually plus certain out-of-pocket expenses. During 2018, we incurred fees and out-of-pocket expenses under this agreement of $0.08
million which were included in selling, general and administrative expenses within our consolidated statements of operations. This agreement was terminated in
connection with our IPO in 2018 and no further payments are due to Cortec.
We lease warehouse and office facilities under various operating leases. One warehouse facility is leased from an entity owned by our founders, brothers Roy and
Ryan Seiders. The warehouse facility lease, which is month-to-month and can be cancelled upon 30 days' written notice, requires monthly payments of $8,700 and is
included in selling, general and administrative expenses within our consolidated statements of operations.

In April 2016, we entered into an agreement with a minority stockholder (less than 1%), to provide strategic and financial advisory services for a fee of $.0 million.
The term of the agreement was fifteen months and the fee was due upon the consummation of a merger, sale, IPO, or other transaction. In 2016, we accrued the full
amount payable under the agreement of $3.0 million in accrued liabilities, and subsequently reversed the full amount in August 2017 when the agreement term ended.
No amounts were paid in 2016 or 2017. In July 2018, we entered into an agreement with the same minority stockholder, to provide strategic and financial advisory
services for a fee of $2.0 million. The term of the agreement was the earlier oftwelve months of the date of an IPO or similar sale of equity. Following our IPO, we paid
the minority stockholder $2.0 million.

In May 2017, we acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities from Rambler On LLC ('Rambler On") for $6.0 million. At the time, Rambler On
was our exclusive drinkware customization partner and a variable interest entity, which we reflected as a consolidated subsidiary. The purchase price consisted of cash of
$2.9 million and a $3.0 million principal amount promissory note payable to the seller, with atwo year term and bearing interest at5% per annum, payable in two equal
installments on May 16, 2018 and May 16, 2019. Subsequent to acquisition, the sole owner of Rambler On became a YETI employee. In May 2019, we repaid in full the
remaining principal amount on the unsecured promissory note to Rambler On.

(1) We have entered into commitments for service and maintenance agreements related to our management information systems, distribution contracts, advertising,
sponsorships, and licensing agreements.

As we are unable to reasonably predict the timing of settlement of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits and other noncurrent tax liabilities, the table above
does not include $8.7 million, net, of such liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 2, 2021.

We are involved in various claims and legal proceedings, some of which are covered by insurance. We believe that the existing claims and proceedings, and
potential losses relating to such contingencies, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

On December 22, 2017, U.S. federal legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs act (the "Tax Act") was signed into law, significantly reforming the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The Tax Act, among other things, reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, required companies to pay a one-time
transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, and put into effect the migration from a "worldwide" system of taxation to a
territorial system. During 2018, we finalized the accounting for the enactment of the Tax Act, with an immaterial adjustment to the amount recorded in the year of
enactment.

We consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested, and, accordingly, no taxes have been recognized on such earnings
except for the transition tax recognized as part of the Tax Act. We continue to evaluate our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. If we
determine that all or a portion of our foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state
income taxes. At January 2, 2021, we had unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries of $6.9 million.

The Tax Act introduced new provisions for U.S. taxation of certain global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI"). We elected to account for the tax on GILTI as a
period cost and therefore have not recorded deferred taxes related to GILTI on our foreign subsidiaries.

As of January 2, 2021, we had Texas research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $1.9 million, which if not utilized, will expire beginning
in 2037.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure
None.
Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's
rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with
the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of January 2, 2021.
Previously Reported Material Weakness
As previously disclosed in Part II Item 9A Controls and Procedures in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2019, during the
preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 30, 2017, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial
reporting related to ineffective information technology general controls ("ITGCs") in the areas of user access and program change-management over certain information
technology systems that support our financial reporting process.
During 2019, we implemented our previously disclosed remediation plan that included: (i) hiring a new Chief Information Officer and an IT Compliance Manager
in July 2019 to continue to improve our information technology systems, including the enhancement of related policies and procedures, and the development and
documentation of our ongoing ITGC improvement initiatives; and (ii) completing the implementation of remediation activities during the fourth quarter of 2019 within
our SAP environment and across our other information technology systems that support our financial reporting process.
During the third quarter ended September 26, 2020, we completed the necessary testing to conclude that the material weakness has been remediated as of
September 26, 2020.
Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange
Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and
includes those policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
of our assets; provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that
our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with appropriate authorizations; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.
Our management has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2021, using the criteria set forth
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) ("COSO"). Based on the results of this
evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting were effective as of January 2, 2021.
Our independent registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton LLP, has audited our internal control over financial reporting. Their opinion on the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2021 appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.

**Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting**

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

**Inherent Limitations in Effectiveness of Controls**

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures, or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake or fraud. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by individuals or groups of persons or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements in our public reports due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

**Item 9B. Other information**

None.
