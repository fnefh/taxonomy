The image depicts a page of text, likely from a document or article, with a white background and black text. The text is arranged in a single column, with no visible headings, subheadings, or other formatting elements. The font appears to be a standard serif font, such as Times New Roman or Garamond.

Upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the text is actually a placeholder or filler text, commonly used in graphic design and publishing to demonstrate the layout and typography of a page without distracting from the content. The text itself is nonsensical and does not convey any meaningful information.

In terms of formatting, the text is left-justified, with no visible margins or padding. The line spacing is consistent throughout the page, with no apparent indentation or leading. The text is not bolded, italicized, or underlined, and there are no visible hyperlinks or other interactive elements.

Overall, the image presents a clean and simple layout, with a focus on showcasing the typography and text flow. The use of placeholder text suggests that the image is intended for design or demonstration purposes, rather than for conveying actual information or content.

### Introduction

*   Theories are systematic explanations of phenomena that are supported by evidence and are subject to testing and revision.
*   Theories can be classified into different types, such as:
    *   **Descriptive theories**: describe how something works without explaining why it works.
    *   **Explanatory theories**: explain why something works.
    *   **Predictive theories**: make predictions about future events based on current data.
*   Theories are important in psychology because they help us understand complex phenomena and make sense of the world around us.

### What is a Theory?

*   A theory is a systematic explanation of a phenomenon that is supported by evidence and is subject to testing and revision.
*   Theories are not just hunches or guesses, but rather a well-thought-out explanation of a phenomenon.
*   Theories are based on data and observations, and are subject to testing and revision as new evidence becomes available.

### Theories of Personality

*   **Psychoanalytic Theory**: developed by Sigmund Freud, this theory suggests that personality is shaped by early childhood experiences and unconscious conflicts.
*   **Humanistic Theory**: developed by Carl Rogers, this theory suggests that personality is shaped by an individual's inherent tendency towards self-actualization.
*   **Trait Theory**: developed by Gordon Allport, this theory suggests that personality is composed of a set of stable traits that are consistent across situations.
*   **Social Learning Theory**: developed by Albert Bandura, this theory suggests that personality is shaped by learning and observation.

### Theories of Intelligence

*   **Intelligence Quotient (IQ) Theory**: developed by Alfred Binet, this theory suggests that intelligence is measured by a person's ability to solve problems and reason.
*   **Multiple Intelligences Theory**: developed by Howard Gardner, this theory suggests that there are multiple types of intelligence, such as linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalistic.
*   **Triarchic Theory**: developed by Robert Sternberg, this theory suggests that intelligence is composed of three components: analytical, creative, and practical.

### Theories of Learning

*   **Behaviorist Theory**: developed by John B. Watson, this theory suggests that learning occurs through classical conditioning and operant conditioning.
*   **Cognitive Theory**: developed by Ulric Neisser, this theory suggests that learning occurs through the process of information processing.
*   **Social Cognitive Theory**: developed by Albert Bandura, this theory suggests that learning occurs through observation, imitation, and reinforcement.

### Theories of Motivation

*   **Drive-Reduction Theory**: developed by Clark Hull, this theory suggests that motivation is driven by the need to reduce physiological drives.
*   **Intrinsic Motivation Theory**: developed by Edward Deci, this theory suggests that motivation is driven by internal factors, such as personal interest and enjoyment.
*   **Self-Determination Theory**: developed by Edward Deci and Richard Ryan, this theory suggests that motivation is driven by three innate psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness.

### Theories of Emotion

*   **James-Lange Theory**: developed by William James and Carl Lange, this theory suggests that emotions are a result of physiological arousal and cognitive interpretation.
*   **Two-Factor Theory**: developed by Stanley Schachter and Jerome Singer, this theory suggests that emotions are a result of two factors: physiological arousal and cognitive interpretation.
*   **Appraisal Theory**: developed by Richard Lazarus, this theory suggests that emotions are a result of appraisal and evaluation of a situation.

### Theories of Social Behavior

*   **Social Exchange Theory**: developed by George Homans, this theory suggests that social behavior is motivated by the desire to maximize rewards and minimize costs.
*   **Social Learning Theory**: developed by Albert Bandura, this theory suggests that social behavior is learned through observation, imitation, and reinforcement.
*   **Social Identity Theory**: developed by Henri Tajfel and John Turner, this theory suggests that social behavior is motivated by the desire to maintain a positive social identity.

### Conclusion

*   Theories are systematic explanations of phenomena that are supported by evidence and are subject to testing and revision.
*   Theories are important in psychology because they help us understand complex phenomena and make sense of the world around us.
*   There are many different types of theories in psychology, including descriptive, explanatory, and predictive theories.
*   Theories can be classified into different categories, such as theories of personality, intelligence, learning, motivation, emotion, and social behavior.

PART I
Item 1. Business
Overview
Headquartered in Austin, Texas, YETI is a global designer, retailer, and distributor of innovative outdoor products. From coolers and drinkware to bags and apparel, YETI products are built to meet the unique and varying needs of diverse outdoor pursuits,
whether in the remote wilderness, at the beach, or anywhere life takes you. By consistently delivering high-performing, exceptional products, we have built a strong following of brand loyalists throughout the world, ranging from serious outdoor enthusiasts to
individuals who simply value products of uncompromising quality and design. We have an unwavering commitment to outdoor and recreation communities, and we are relentless in our pursuit of building superior products for people to confidently enjoy life
outdoors and beyond.
We were founded in 2006 by avid outdoorsmen, Roy and Ryan Seiders (our "Founders"), who were frustrated with equipment that could not keep pace with their interests in hunting and fishing. By utilizing forward-thinking designs and advanced
manufacturing techniques, they developed a nearly indestructible hard cooler with superior ice retention. Our original hard cooler not only delivered exceptional performance, it anchored an authentic, passionate, and durable bond among customers and our
company.
Our principal corporate offices are located in Austin, Texas. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to "YETI," the "Company," "we," "us," and "our" used herein refer to YETI Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
We have a 52- or 53-week period that ends on the Saturday closest in proximity to December 31, such that each quarterly period will be 13 weeks in length, except during a 53-week period when the fourth quarter will be 14 weeks. Our fiscal years ended
December 31, 2022 ("2022") and January 1, 2022 ("2021") spanned 52 weeks each, whereas our fiscal year ended January 2, 2021 ("2020") included 53 weeks. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to our
fiscal years ended in December and the associated quarters, months, and periods of those fiscal years.
Our Products
Our product portfolio is comprised of three categories: Coolers & Equipment; Drinkware; and Other. We have a history of consistently broadening our high-performance, premium-priced product portfolio to meet our expanding customer base and their
evolving pursuits. Our culture of innovation and success in identifying customer needs and wants drives our robust product roadmap. In 2022, net sales of Coolers & Equipment, Drinkware, and Other represented 38%, 59%, and 2% of net sales, respectively.
Refer to Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for net sales by product category.
Coolers & Equipment
Our Coolers & Equipment family is comprised of hard coolers, soft coolers, cargo, bags, outdoor living, and associated accessories.
**Hard Coolers.** Most of our hard coolers are built with seamless rotationally-molded, or rotomolded, construction, making them nearly indestructible. For superior ice retention, we pressure-inject up to two inches of commercial-grade polyurethane foam
into the walls and lid and utilize a freezer-quality gasket to seal the lid. Our hard cooler category includes YETI Tundraโขโข, YETI Roadieยฎ, YETI V Seriesโขโข hard coolers, YETI TANKยฎ ice bucket, and YETI Siloโขโข 6G water cooler. We also offer related
accessories, including locks, dry baskets, beverage holders, dividers, an ice scoop, and other add-ons, to enhance our products' versatility.
**Soft Coolers.** The Hopperยฎ is our line of soft coolers, which are designed to be leakproof and provide superior durability and ice retention compared to ordinary soft coolers. The Hopper soft cooler product line includes: the next-generation Hopper M30
Soft Cooler, Hopperยฎ M20 Backpack Cooler, Hopper Flipยฎ Soft Cooler, Daytripโขโข Lunch Bag, and Daytripโขโข Lunch Box. Our soft coolers also include related accessory options such as the Rambler Bottle Sling, MOLLE Zinger retractable lanyard, and a
mountable MOLLE Bottle Opener.

In January 2023, we notified the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC") of a potential safety concern regarding the magnet-lined closures of our Hopper M30 Soft Cooler, Hopperยฎ M20 Soft Backpack Cooler, and SideKick Dry gear case
(the "affected products") and initiated a global stop sale of the affected products. In February 2023, we proposed a voluntary recall of the affected products to the CPSC and other relevant global regulatory authorities, which we refer to throughout this Report
as the "voluntary recalls" unless otherwise indicated. We are working in cooperation with the CPSC and other relevant global regulatory authorities on the corrective action plan and hope to begin implementing the voluntary recalls in the coming weeks. Once
our proposed voluntary recall plans are approved, consumers will have the ability to return the affected products for a remedy. We are also working on solutions to address the potential safety concern of the affected products and intend to resume the sale of the
redesigned products in the fourth quarter of 2023. However, there are a number of factors that could impact our ability to resume sales at that time and our estimate of the date for sales of the redesigned products to resume may change. For additional
information on the financial impact of the voluntary recalls, see Part II, Item 7, "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." See Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business, Operations
and Industry."

Cargo, Bags, and Outdoor Living. Our cargo, bags, and outdoor living product category includes: LoadOut Bucketโข, LoadOutยฎ GoBoxTM, the Pangaโขโข submersible duffel bag, Pangaโขโข Backpack, Crossroadsโขโข Collection of backpacks, duffel bags,
luggage, and packing cubes, Caminoโขโข Carryall, Hondoโขโข Base Camp Chair, Trailheadโขโข Camp Chair, Lowlandsโขโข Blanket, Trailheadโขโข Dog Bed, Boomerโขโข Dog Bowls, and SideKick Dry gear case.

Drinkware

Most of our Drinkware products are made with durable, kitchen-grade, 18/8 stainless-steel, double-wall vacuum insulation, and our innovative No Sweatโขโข design. The result is high-performing drinkware products that keep beverages at their preferred
temperature whether hot or cold for hours at a time without condensation. During 2022, we introduced Yonderโขโข Water Bottles, our first lightweight water bottle made of durable and safe BPA-free material. Our Drinkware product line currently includes
ten product families including the Rambler Colsters, Rambler Lowball, Rambler Wine Tumbler, Rambler Stackable Pints, Rambler Mugs, Rambler Tumblers, Rambler Straw Mugs & Cups, Rambler Bottles, Rambler Jugs, and Yonderโขโข Water Bottles. Related
accessories include the Rambler Bottle Straw Cap, Rambler Bottle Chug Cap, Rambler Magslider Lid, Rambler Straw Lid, Rambler Magslider color pack, Rambler Tumbler Handles, and Rambler Jug Mount.

Other

Our Other category offers an array of apparel and gear, such as hats, shirts, bottle openers, and ice substitutes.

Segment Information

We operate as one reportable segment.

Sales Channels

We offer our products in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and Japan through a diverse omni-channel strategy, comprised of our wholesale and our direct-to-consumer (DTC") channels. In 2022 and 2021, our DTC channel
accounted for 58% and 56% of our net sales, respectively, and our wholesale channel accounted for 42% and 44% of our net sales, respectively. As part of our commitment to premium positioning, we maintain supply discipline, consistently enforce our
minimum advertised price ("MAP") policy, and primarily sell through one-step distribution.

In our wholesale channel, we sell to several large retailers with a national presence, including Dick's Sporting Goods, REI, Academy Sports + Outdoors, Bass Pro Shops, Ace Hardware, and Scheels, and an assemblage of independent retail partners
throughout the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and Japan, among others. We carefully evaluate and select retail partners that have an image and approach that are consistent with our premium brand and pricing, while also seeking new
retail partners that create access to unique shopping experiences or customer bases. Our network of independent retail partners includes outdoor specialty, hardware, sporting goods, and farm and ranch supply stores, among others. As of December 31, 2022,
we sold through a diverse base of approximately 2,900 independent retail partners. For 2022, our largest single wholesale customer represented approximately 11% of gross sales.

**Seasonality**
Historically, we have experienced net sales to be highest in the fourth and second quarters, due in part to seasonal holiday demand, followed by the third quarter, and the lowest sales in the first quarter. However, we expect the stop sale of the products related to the voluntary recalls to impact our traditional seasonal patterns in 2023, with expected net sales to be highest in the fourth quarter of 2023.

**Intellectual Property and Brand Protection**
We own patents, trademarks, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights that support key aspects of our brand and products. We believe these intellectual property rights, combined with our innovation and distinctive product design, performance, and brand name and reputation, provide us with a competitive advantage. We protect our intellectual property rights in the United States and certain international jurisdictions on all new products.

We aggressively pursue and defend our intellectual property rights to protect our distinctive brand, designs, and inventions. We have processes and procedures in place to identify, protect, and optimize our intellectual property assets on a global basis. Our experienced legal and brand protection teams initiate claims and litigation to protect our intellectual property assets. In the future, we intend to continue to seek intellectual property protection for our new products and enforce our rights against those who infringe on these valuable assets.

All product designs, specifications, and performance characteristics are developed and documented. After these aspects of the process are complete, we seek intellectual property protection to the fullest extent possible, including applying for patents and for registration of trademarks and copyrights.

We have a proactive online marketplace monitoring and seller/listing termination program to disrupt any online counterfeit offerings. In addition, we work to shut down websites selling counterfeit products through litigation.

**Human Capital Resources**
At YETI, we have an unwavering commitment to outdoor and recreation communities, and we are relentless in our pursuit of building superior products for people to confidently enjoy life outdoors and beyond. We are proud of our unique company culture, where ideas, innovation, collaboration and personal development are essential. We believe our brand, culture, and employees are central to our success and our ability to attract, develop, motivate, and retain highly-skilled talent.

As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 922 people worldwide, representing seven countries. Of these, approximately 90% of our workforce was located in the United States. None of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have no labor-related work stoppages and believe our relations with our employees are positive and stable.

**Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I).** We believe that an equitable, inclusive, and culturally diverse environment is imperative and key to our long-term growth. We are committed to building an inclusive and diverse culture through a variety of initiatives on employee recruitment, employee training and development. Our DE&I Council is composed of a group of employees representing different demographics, backgrounds, and teams that provides perspective and counsel on DE&I-related topics. We continue to support our voluntary, employee-led affinity groups that foster a diverse and inclusive workplace aligned with our core values, goals, and business practices.

**Compensation and Benefits.** We strive to hire, develop and retain top talent. We attract and reward our employees by providing competitive benefits, including market-competitive compensation, healthcare, 401(k) program, paid time off, bonding leave, as well as health, wellness, and financial planning programs.

**Communication and Engagement.** We actively communicate and listen to employees through multiple internal channels and encourage employees to provide feedback about their experiences through ongoing employee engagement activities, including employee satisfaction surveys. We strive to address feedback in real time and provide an environment where our employees can have fulfilling careers and be more productive, creative, happy, and healthy.

Consistent with our focus on employee growth and development, we offer employees the opportunity to participate in educational activities and periodic trainings. Additionally, we employ a variety of recognition programs to recognize leadership and other employees who best exemplify our core values. We also encourage and provide opportunity for our employees to give back to the communities that support us. We provide up to four hours of paid time off to vote, as part of our participation in Time to Vote, and offer employees the chance to dedicate one full day of work to volunteering for an organization of their choice.

We rely on third-party contract manufacturers, and problems with, or loss of, our suppliers or an inability to obtain raw materials could harm our business and results of operations.
Our products are produced by third-party contract manufacturers, typically through a series of purchase orders. Manufacturers may breach our agreements with them, including purchase orders, and we may not be able to enforce our rights under these
agreements or may incur significant costs attempting to do so. We therefore face the risk that these third-party contract manufacturers may not produce and deliver our products in adequate quantities, on a timely basis or at all, or that they will fail to comply
with our quality standards. We have experienced, and will likely continue to experience, operational difficulties with our manufacturers. These difficulties include reductions in the availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product
specifications and regulatory and customer requirements, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines, failure to achieve our product quality standards, increases in costs of materials, and manufacturing or other business interruptions. The
ability of our manufacturers to effectively satisfy our production requirements could also be impacted by manufacturer financial difficulty or damage to their operations caused by fire, terrorist attack, riots, natural disaster, public health emergencies, or other
events. The failure of any manufacturer to perform to our expectations could result in supply shortages or delays for certain products and harm our business. If we experience significantly increased demand, or if we need to replace an existing manufacturer due
to lack of performance, we may be unable to supplement or replace our manufacturing capacity on a timely basis or on terms that are acceptable to us, which may increase our costs, reduce our margins, and harm our ability to deliver our products on time. For
certain of our products, it may take a significant amount of time to identify and qualify a manufacturer that has the capability and resources to produce our products to our specifications in sufficient volume and satisfy our service and quality control standards.
In addition, our manufacturers may raise prices in the future, which would increase our costs and harm our margins. Any of these risks could harm our ability to deliver our products on time, or at all, damage our reputation and our relationships with our retail
partners and customers, and increase our product costs thereby reducing our margins.
The capacity of our manufacturers to produce our products is also dependent upon the availability of raw materials. Our manufacturers may not be able to obtain sufficient supply of raw materials, which could result in delays in deliveries of our products
by our manufacturers or increased costs. Any shortage of raw materials or inability of a manufacturer to produce or ship our products in a timely manner, or at all, could impair our ability to ship orders of our products in a cost-efficient, timely manner and
could cause us to miss the delivery requirements of our customers. As a result, we could experience cancellations of orders, refusals to accept deliveries, or reductions in our prices and margins, any of which could harm our financial performance, reputation,
and results of operations.
If we fail to timely and effectively obtain shipments of products from our manufacturers and deliver products to our retail partners and customers, our business and results of operations could be harmed.
Our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. However, we cannot control all of the factors that might affect the timely and effective procurement of our products from our third-party contract manufacturers and
the delivery of our products to our retail partners and customers.
Our third-party contract manufacturers ship most of our products to our distribution centers in Memphis, Tennessee, and Salt Lake City, Utah. Our reliance on only two geographical locations for our domestic distribution centers makes us more vulnerable
to natural disasters, weather-related disruptions, accidents, system failures, public health emergencies, or other unforeseen events that could delay or impair our ability to fulfill retailer orders and/or ship merchandise purchased on our website, which could harm
our sales.
We import our products, and rely on the timely and free flow of goods through open and operational ports from our suppliers and manufacturers. Accordingly, we are subject to certain risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activity, inclement
weather, public health crises, and increased transportation costs, associated with our third-party contract manufacturers' and carriers' ability to provide products and services to meet our requirements. Such events could result in delayed or canceled orders by
customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages, and harm to our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We are also vulnerable to risks associated with products manufactured abroad, including, among other things: (a) risks of
damage, destruction, or confiscation of products while in transit to our distribution centers; and (b) transportation and other delays in shipments, including as a result of heightened security screening, port congestion, container and labor shortages, and
inspection processes or other port-of-entry limitations or restrictions. Global events may also impact the import of our products. For example, as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in March 2022, the United States and other governments have
implemented coordinated sanctions, seizures of assets, and export-control measure packages. These measures, and the global response to the invasion, resulted in increased fuel prices. Although we do not do business in Ukraine, downstream effects of the
conflict have resulted in higher fuels costs, which has resulted in, and could continue to result in, higher costs to deliver products, which could harm our profitability.

In order to meet demand for a product, we have chosen in the past, and may choose in the future, to arrange for additional quantities of the product, if available, to be delivered through air freight, which is significantly more expensive than standard
shipping by sea and, consequently, adversely impacts our gross margins. In addition, we rely upon independent land-based and air freight carriers for product shipments from our distribution centers to our retail partners and customers who purchase through
our DTC channel. We may not be able to obtain sufficient freight capacity on a timely basis or at favorable shipping rates and, therefore, may not be able to receive products from suppliers or deliver products to retail partners or customers in a timely and cost-
effective manner. Failure to procure our products from our third-party contract manufacturers and deliver merchandise to our retail partners and DTC channel in a timely, effective, and economically viable manner could reduce our sales and gross margins,
damage our brand, and harm our business.

**Our business is subject to the risk of manufacturer concentrations.**

We depend on a limited number of third-party contract manufacturers for the sourcing of our products. For hard coolers, soft coolers, Drinkware, bags, cargo, and outdoor living and pet products, our two largest manufacturers comprised approximately
72%, 85%, 80%, 86%, 89% and 90% respectively, of our production volume during 2022. As a result of this concentration in our supply chain, our business and operations would be negatively affected if any of our key manufacturers were to experience
significant disruption affecting the price, quality, availability, or timely delivery of products. Our manufacturers could also be acquired by our competitors and may become our direct competitors, thus limiting or eliminating our access to manufacturing
capacity. The partial or complete loss of our key manufacturers, or a significant adverse change in our relationship with any of these manufacturers, could result in lost sales, added costs, and distribution delays that could harm our business and customer
relationships.

**Our business could be harmed if we fail to execute our internal plans to transition our supply chain and certain other business processes to a global scale.**

We are in the process of re-engineering certain of our supply chain management processes, as well as certain other business processes, to support our expanding scale. This expansion to a global scale requires significant investment of capital and human
resources, the re-engineering of many business processes, and the attention of many managers and other employees who would otherwise be focused on other aspects of our business. If our globalization efforts fail to produce planned efficiencies, or the
transition is not managed effectively, we may experience excess inventories, inventory shortage, late deliveries, lost sales, or increased costs. Any business disruption arising from our globalization efforts, or our failure to effectively execute our internal plans
for globalization, could harm our results of operations and financial condition.

**If we cannot maintain prices or effectively implement price increases, our margins may decrease.**

Increasing demand, supply constraints, inflation, and other market conditions have resulted in increasing shortages and higher costs for the production of some of our products, leading us to implement a price increase for certain of our products effective in
2022. Our ability to maintain prices or effectively implement price increases, including our recent price increases in 2022, may be affected by several factors, including pricing pressure due to intense competition in the retail industry, effectiveness of our
marketing programs, the continuing growth of our brand, general economic conditions, and changes in consumer demand. During challenging economic times, consumers may be less willing or able to pay a price premium for our branded products and may
shift purchases to lower-priced or other value offerings, making it more difficult for us to maintain prices and/or effectively implement price increases. In addition, our retail partners and distributors may pressure us to rescind price increases we have announced
or already implemented, whether through a change in list price or increased promotional activity. If we cannot maintain prices or effectively implement price increases for our products, or must increase promotional activity, our margins may be adversely
affected. Furthermore, price increases generally result in volume losses, as consumers purchase fewer units. If such losses are greater than expected or if we lose distribution due to a price increase, our business, financial condition and results of operations may
be materially and adversely affected.

Our plans for international expansion may not be successful; our limited operating experience and limited brand recognition in new markets may make it more difficult to execute our expansion strategy and cause our business and growth to suffer.

Continued expansion into markets outside the United States, including Canada, Australia, Europe and Japan, is one of our key long-term strategies for the future growth of our business. There are, however, significant costs and risks inherent in selling our
products in international markets, including: (a) failure to effectively translate and establish our core brand identity, particularly in markets with a less-established heritage of outdoor and recreational activities; (b) time and difficulty in building a widespread
network of retail partners; (c) increased shipping and distribution costs, which could increase our expenses and reduce our margins; (d) potentially lower margins in some regions; (e) longer collection cycles in some regions; (f) increased competition from
local providers of similar products; (g) compliance with foreign laws and regulations, including taxes and duties, enhanced privacy laws, rules, and regulations, and product liability laws, rules, and regulations, particularly in the European Union and Japan;
(h) establishing and maintaining effective internal controls at foreign locations and the associated increased costs; (i) increased counterfeiting and the uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and practical difficulties of
enforcing rights abroad; (j) compliance with anti-bribery, anti-corruption, sanctions, and anti-money laundering laws, such as the FCPA, the Bribery Act, and OFAC regulations, by us, our employees, and our business partners; (k) currency exchange rate
fluctuations and related effects on our results of operations; (1) economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in foreign economies and markets; (m) compliance with tax, employment, immigration, and labor laws for employees living or
traveling abroad; (n) workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States; (o) business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, natural disasters, including earthquakes,
typhoons, floods, and fires, public health emergencies, including the outbreak of a pandemic or other public health crisis; (p) the imposition of tariffs on products that we import into international markets that could make such products more expensive
compared to those of our competitors; (q) that our ability to expand internationally could be impacted by the intellectual property rights of third parties that conflict with or are superior to ours; and (r) other costs and risks of doing business internationally.

These and other factors could harm our international operations and, consequently, harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Further, we may incur significant operating expenses as a result of our planned international expansion,
and it may not be successful. We have limited experience with regulatory environments and market practices internationally, and we may not be able to penetrate or successfully operate in new markets. We also have limited operating experience outside of the
United States and in our expansion efforts we may encounter obstacles we did not face in the United States, including cultural and linguistic differences, differences in regulatory environments, labor practices and market practices, difficulties in keeping abreast
of market, business and technical developments, and preferences of foreign customers. Consumer demand and behavior, as well as tastes and purchasing trends, may differ internationally, and, as a result, sales of our products may not be successful, or the
margins on those sales may not be in line with those we anticipate. We may also encounter difficulty expanding into international markets because of limited brand recognition, leading to delayed or limited acceptance of our products by customers in these
markets and increased marketing and customer acquisition costs to establish our brand. Accordingly, if we are unable to successfully expand internationally or manage the complexity of our global operations, we may not achieve the expected benefits of this
expansion and our financial condition and results of operations could be harmed.

Our financial results and future growth have been, and could in the future be, harmed by currency exchange rate fluctuations.

As our international business grows, our results of operations have been and could in the future be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Revenues and certain expenses in markets outside of the United States are recognized in
local foreign currencies, and we are exposed to gains or losses from the translation of those amounts into U.S. dollars for consolidation into our financial statements. Similarly, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from currency exchange rate
fluctuations on transactions generated by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies. In addition, the business of our independent manufacturers may also be disrupted by currency exchange rate fluctuations by making their
purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. As a result, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our results of operations.

We may become involved in legal or regulatory proceedings and audits.
Our business requires compliance with many laws and regulations, including labor and employment, sales and other taxes, customs, and consumer protection laws and ordinances that regulate retailers generally and/or govern the importation, promotion,
and sale of merchandise, and the operation of stores and warehouse facilities. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to lawsuits and other proceedings, and could also lead to damage awards, fines, and penalties. We may become
involved in a number of legal proceedings and audits, including government and agency investigations, and consumer, employment, tort, and other litigation. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings, audits, and other contingencies could require us to
take, or refrain from taking, actions that could harm our operations or require us to pay substantial amounts of money, harming our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may be necessary,
which could result in substantial costs and diversion of management's attention and resources, harming our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any pending or future legal or regulatory proceedings and audits could harm our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.
Our business involves the potential for product recalls, warranty liability, product liability, and other claims against us, which could adversely affect our reputation, earnings and financial condition.
As a designer, marketer, retailer, and distributor of consumer products, we are subject to the United States Consumer Products Safety Act of 1972, as amended by the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, which empowers the Consumer
Products Safety Commission ("CPSC") to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous, and similar laws under foreign jurisdictions. Although we extensively and rigorously test new and enhanced products, there can be no
assurance we will be able to detect, prevent, or fix all defects. Under certain circumstances, the CPSC, and other relevant global regulatory authorities, could require us to repurchase or recall one or more of our products. Additionally, laws regulating consumer
products exist in states and some cities, as well as other countries in which we sell our products, and more restrictive laws and regulations may be adopted in the future. Any repurchase or recall of our products, monetary judgment, fine or other penalty could
be costly and damaging to our reputation. If we were required to remove, or we voluntarily removed, our products from the market, our reputation could be tarnished and we may have large quantities of finished products that we could not sell. Furthermore, the
occurrence of any material defects in our products could expose us to liability for warranty claims in excess of our current reserves, and if our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our products, our financial condition and
operating results may be harmed.
In January 2023, we notified the CPSC of a potential safety concern regarding the magnet-lined closures of our Hopper M30 Soft Cooler, Hopperยฎ M20 Soft Backpack Cooler, and SideKick Dry gear case (the "affected products") and initiated a global
stop sale of the affected products. In February 2023, we proposed a voluntary recall of the affected products to the CPSC and other relevant global regulatory authorities. The global stop sale of the affected products and proposed voluntary recalls will subject
us to substantial costs, including, but not limited to, product recall remedies, legal and advisory fees, and recall-related logistics costs. These actions may also result in adverse publicity, harm our brand and divert management's attention and resources from
our operations. We are working in cooperation with the CPSC and other relevant global regulatory authorities on the corrective action plan. Actual costs related to the global stop sale and voluntary recalls of the affected products may vary from our estimates,
which are primarily based on expected consumer participation rates and the estimated costs of the consumer's elected remedy in the proposed voluntary recall and may have further negative effects on our business. Any of these events or claims could harm our
reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to develop a product solution for the potential safety concern regarding the affected products, we may not be able to sell the redesigned products for a significant period of time,
if ever, and may face substantial costs associated with the development of such features and implementation of the recalls.
We also face exposure to product liability claims and unusual or significant litigation in the event that one of our products is alleged to have resulted in bodily injury, property damage, or other adverse effects. In addition to the risk of monetary judgments
or other penalties that may result from product liability claims, such claims could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation in the marketplace, adversely impact our brand, or result in an increase in the cost of producing our products. As a
result, these types of claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Our business is subject to the risk of earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods, and other catastrophic events, and to interruption by problems such as terrorism, public health crises, cyberattacks, or failure of key information technology systems

Our business is vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, fires, floods, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, acts of war, riots, public health crises, human errors, criminal acts, and similar events. For example, a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire, or flood, could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition, and our insurance coverage may be insufficient to compensate us for losses that may occur. Our corporate offices, one of our distribution centers, and one of our data center facilities are located in Texas, a state that frequently experiences floods and storms, and our third-party contract manufacturers ship most of our products to our distribution centers in Memphis, Tennessee, and Salt Lake City, Utah, which are susceptible to floods, earthquakes and wildfires. In addition, the facilities of our suppliers and where our manufacturers produce our products are located in parts of Asia that frequently experience typhoons and earthquakes. Acts of terrorism and public health crises could also cause disruptions in our or our suppliers', manufacturers', and logistics providers' businesses or the economy as a whole. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic contributed significantly to global supply chain issues, with restrictions and limitations on related activities causing disruption and delay. These disruptions and delays strained certain domestic and international supply chains, which affected the flow or availability of certain of our products. We may not have sufficient protection or recovery plans in some circumstances, such as natural disasters affecting Texas or other locations where we have operations or store significant inventory. Our servers are also vulnerable to computer viruses, criminal acts, denial-of-service attacks, ransomware, and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems, which could lead to interruptions, delays, or loss of critical data. As we rely heavily on our information technology and communications systems and the Internet to conduct our business and provide high-quality customer service, these disruptions could harm our ability to run our business and either directly or indirectly disrupt our suppliers' or manufacturers' businesses, which could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Any such disruptions to our third-party contract manufacturers could have a similar effect.

Our results of operations are subject to seasonal and quarterly variations, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.

We believe that our sales include a seasonal component. Historically, we have experienced our net sales to be highest in our second and fourth quarters, with the first quarter generating the lowest sales. However, we expect the stop sale of the products related to the proposed voluntary recalls to impact our traditional seasonal patterns in 2023, with net sales to be highest in the fourth quarter. We expect that this seasonality will continue to be a factor in our results of operations and sales.

Our annual and quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including, among other things, the timing of the introduction of and advertising for our new products and those of our competitors and changes in our product mix. Our results are also expected to be impacted by the voluntary recalls of certain of our products proposed to the CPSC and other relevant global regulatory authorities, including the response of the CPSC and other relevant global regulatory authorities to our proposal; and timing and our ability to provide a remedy with respect to the affected products. Variations in weather conditions may also harm our quarterly results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to adjust our spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in our sales. As a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our results of operations between different quarters within a single fiscal year, or across different fiscal years, are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance. In the event that any seasonal or quarterly fluctuations in our net sales and results of operations result in our failure to meet our forecasts or the forecasts of the research analysts that may cover us in the future, the market price of our common stock could fluctuate or decline.

We are subject to many hazards and operational risks that can disrupt our business, some of which may not be insured or fully covered by insurance.

Our operations are subject to many hazards and operational risks inherent to our business, including: (a) general business risks; (b) product liability; (c) product recall; and (d) damage to third parties, our infrastructure, or properties caused by fires, floods and other natural disasters, power losses, telecommunications failures, terrorist attacks, riots, public health crises, human errors, and similar events.

Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover our liabilities related to such hazards or operational risks. For example, our insurance coverage does not cover us for business interruptions as they relate to public health crises and may not offer coverage for such interruptions related to future pandemics or epidemics. In addition, we may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable and commercially justifiable, and insurance may not continue to be available on terms as favorable as our current arrangements. The occurrence of a significant uninsured claim or a claim in excess of the insurance coverage limits maintained by us could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

**Risks Related to Market and Global Economic Conditions**

Our net sales and profits depend on the level of customer spending for our products, which is sensitive to general economic conditions and other factors; adverse economic conditions, such as a downturn in the economy or inflationary conditions resulting in rising prices, could adversely affect consumer purchases of discretionary items, which could materially harm our sales, profitability, and financial condition.

Our products are discretionary items for customers. Therefore, the success of our business depends significantly on economic factors and trends in consumer spending. There are a number of factors that influence consumer spending, including actual and perceived economic conditions, consumer confidence, disposable consumer income, consumer credit availability, unemployment, and tax rates in the markets where we sell our products. Consumers also have discretion as to where to spend their disposable income and may choose to purchase other items or services if we do not continue to provide authentic, compelling, and high-quality products at appropriate price points. As global economic conditions continue to be volatile and economic uncertainty remains, trends in consumer discretionary spending also remain unpredictable and subject to declines. Any of these factors could harm discretionary consumer spending, resulting in a reduction in demand for our premium products, decreased prices, and harm to our business and results of operations. Moreover, consumer purchases of discretionary items, such as our products, tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower or during other periods of economic instability or uncertainty, which may slow our growth more than we anticipate. For example, increased oil costs caused by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, inflationary conditions resulting in rising prices, including the prices of our products, and increased interest rates could lead to declines in discretionary spending by consumers, resulting in a reduction in demand for our products, and in turn may materially adversely impact our sales, profitability, and financial condition. Adverse economic conditions in markets in which we sell our products, particularly in the United States, may materially harm our sales, profitability, and financial condition.

**Public health crises, such as COVID-19 pandemic, could negatively impact our business, sales, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.**

The COVID-19 pandemic and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate such have caused, and may continue to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas and significant disruption in the financial markets both globally and in the United States. The emergence of another pandemic, epidemic, or infectious disease outbreak could have a similar effect. The impacts of such public health crises include, but are not limited to:

*   the possibility of retail store closures or reduced operating hours and/or decreased retail traffic;
*   disruption to our distribution centers and our third-party manufacturing partners and other vendors, including the effects of facility closures as a result of outbreaks of COVID-19 or other illnesses, or measures taken by federal, state or local governments to reduce its spread, reductions in operating hours, labor shortages, and real time changes in operating procedures, including for additional cleaning and disinfection procedures; and
*   significant disruption of global financial markets, which could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital in the future.

The COVID-19 pandemic contributed significantly to global supply chain constraints, with restrictions and limitations on related activities causing disruption and delay. These disruptions and delays strained domestic and international supply chains, resulting in port congestion, transportation delays as well as labor and container shortages, and affected the flow or availability of certain products. In addition, increased demand for online purchases of products has impacted our fulfillment operations and small parcel network, resulting in potential delays in delivering products to our customers. Other future public health crises could have a similar effect.

The further spread of COVID-19 or the emergence of another pandemic, epidemic or infectious disease outbreak, including any required or voluntary actions to help limit the spread of illness, could impact our ability to carry out our business and may materially adversely impact global economic conditions, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Such events could materially increase our costs, negatively impact our sales and damage our results of operations and liquidity, possibly to a significant degree. The extent of the impact of such events on our business and financial results cannot be predicted.

### Methodology

*   This study used a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data.
*   The qualitative data was collected through interviews with healthcare professionals and patients, while the quantitative data was collected through a survey of healthcare organizations.
*   The study aimed to investigate the current state of AI in healthcare and its implications for data privacy and security.

### Results

*   The results of the study showed that AI is being used in various ways in healthcare, including medical imaging, patient diagnosis, and personalized medicine.
*   However, the study also found that there are concerns about data privacy and security, with many healthcare professionals and patients expressing concerns about the potential risks associated with the use of AI in healthcare.

### Discussion

*   The study's findings suggest that while AI has the potential to improve healthcare outcomes, it also raises important concerns about data privacy and security.
*   The study's results highlight the need for healthcare organizations to develop robust data privacy and security protocols to protect patient information.
*   The study also suggests that healthcare professionals and patients need to be educated about the potential risks and benefits of AI in healthcare.

### Conclusion

*   In conclusion, the study's findings suggest that AI has the potential to improve healthcare outcomes, but it also raises important concerns about data privacy and security.
*   Healthcare organizations need to develop robust data privacy and security protocols to protect patient information, and healthcare professionals and patients need to be educated about the potential risks and benefits of AI in healthcare.

Our indebtedness may limit our ability to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and if we are unable to comply with the covenants in our current Credit Facility, our liquidity and results of operations could be harmed.

As of December 31, 2022, we had $90.0 million principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Facility (as defined in Part II, Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and
Capital Resources" of this Report). The Credit Facility is jointly and severally guaranteed by certain of our wholly-owned material subsidiaries, including YETI Coolers, LLC, which we refer to as YETI Coolers, and YETI Custom Drinkware LLC, which we
refer to as YCD, and any of our future subsidiaries that become guarantors, together, which we refer to as the Guarantors, and is also secured by a first-priority lien on substantially all of our assets and the assets of the Guarantors, in each case subject to certain
customary exceptions. We may, from time to time, incur additional indebtedness under the Credit Facility.

The Credit Facility places certain conditions on us, including, subject to certain conditions, reductions and exceptions, requiring us to utilize a portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, reducing the availability of our
cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development activity, return capital to our stockholders, and other general corporate purposes. Our compliance with this condition may limit our ability to invest in the ongoing needs of our business. For
example, complying with this condition:

*   increases our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;
*   limits our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or markets;
*   makes us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates, as borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at variable rates;
*   limits our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital or other purposes; and
*   potentially places us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.

The Credit Facility places certain limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness. However, subject to the qualifications and exceptions in the Credit Facility, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness under that facility. The Credit
Facility also places certain limitations on our ability to enter into certain types of transactions, financing arrangements and investments, to make certain changes to our capital structure, and to guarantee certain indebtedness, among other things. The Credit
Facility also places certain restrictions on the payment of dividends and distributions and certain management fees. These restrictions limit or prohibit, among other things, and in each case, subject to certain customary exceptions, our ability to: (a) pay
dividends on, redeem or repurchase our stock, or make other distributions; (b) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; (c) sell stock in our subsidiaries; (d) create or incur liens; (e) make acquisitions or investments; (f) transfer or sell certain assets or merge
or consolidate with or into other companies; (g) make certain payments or prepayments of indebtedness subordinated to our obligations under the Credit Facility; and (h) enter into certain transactions with our affiliates.

The Credit Facility requires us to comply with certain covenants, including financial covenants regarding our total net leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio. Fluctuations in these ratios may increase our interest expense. Failure to comply with these
covenants and certain other provisions of the Credit Facility, or the occurrence of a change of control, could result in an event of default and an acceleration of our obligations under the Credit Facility or other indebtedness that we may incur in the future.

If such an event of default and acceleration of our obligations occurs, the lenders under the Credit Facility would have the right to proceed against the collateral we granted to them to secure such indebtedness, which consists of substantially all of our
assets. If the debt under the Credit Facility were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to sell sufficient collateral to repay this debt, which would immediately and materially harm our business, results of operations, and financial
condition. The threat of our debt being accelerated in connection with a change of control could make it more difficult for us to attract potential buyers or to consummate a change of control transaction that would otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders.

If our goodwill, other intangible assets, or fixed assets become impaired, we may be required to record a charge to our earnings.

We may be required to record future impairments of goodwill, other intangible assets, or fixed assets to the extent the fair value of these assets falls below their book value. Our estimates of fair value are based on assumptions regarding future cash flows,
gross margins, expenses, discount rates applied to these cash flows, and current market estimates of value. Estimates used for future sales growth rates, gross profit performance, and other assumptions used to estimate fair value could cause us to record material
non-cash impairment charges, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition.

Changes in tax laws or unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability.

We are subject to income taxes in the United States (federal and state) and various foreign jurisdictions. Our effective income tax rate could be adversely affected in the future by a number of factors, including changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets
and liabilities, changes in tax laws and regulations or their interpretations and application, and the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world.

For example, on August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the "IRA") which includes changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system, a 15% book minimum tax on corporations with three-year average annual
adjusted financial statement income exceeding $1 billion and a 1% excise tax on share repurchases. These provisions are generally effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. If we become subject to additional taxes under the IRA, particularly
in connection with any future share repurchase program, our financial condition, results of operations, effective tax rate, and cash flows could be negatively impacted.

In addition, member states of the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development are continuing discussions
surrounding fundamental changes to the taxing rights of governments and allocation of profits among tax jurisdictions in which
companies do business, including proposed rules on the implementation of a global minimum tax rate. Although it is uncertain if some or all of these proposals will be enacted, a significant change in U.S. tax law, or that of other countries where we operate or
have a presence, may materially and adversely impact our income tax liability, provision for income taxes and effective tax rate. We regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our income tax provision, which is subject to significant
judgment.

The phase-out of LIBOR and transition to SOFR as a benchmark interest rate may negatively impact our financial results.

LIBOR, the London interbank offered rate, is the interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate on our variable rate debt, including our Credit Facility. On March 5, 2021, LIBOR's regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority and administrator, ICE
Benchmark Administration ("IBA"), announced that the publication of one-week and two-month USD LIBOR maturities and the non-USD LIBOR maturities will cease immediately after December 31, 2021, with the publication of overnight, one-, three-, six-,
and 12-month USD LIBOR ceasing immediately after June 30, 2023. On March 15, 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the "LIBOR ACT") was signed into law. Under the LIBOR Act, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is
directed to select the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as the replacement rate for contracts that reference LIBOR as a benchmark rate and that do not contain either a specified replacement rate
or a replacement mechanism after USD LIBOR ceases publication. In addition, recent New York state legislation effectively codified the use of SOFR as the alternative to LIBOR in the absence of another chosen replacement rate, which may affect contracts
governed by New York state law, including our Credit Agreement.

Our Credit Facility further provides for the replacement of LIBOR with one or more rates based on the SOFR, or another alternate benchmark rate under certain conditions.

SOFR is calculated differently from LIBOR and the inherent differences between LIBOR and SOFR or any other alternative benchmark rate gives rise to many uncertainties, including the need to amend existing debt instruments and the need to choose
alternative reference rates in new contracts. Furthermore, uncertainty regarding whether or when SOFR or other alternative reference rates will be widely accepted by lenders as the replacement for LIBOR may impact the liquidity of the SOFR loan market,
and SOFR itself. Since the initial publication of SOFR, daily changes in the rate have, on occasion, been more volatile than daily changes in comparable benchmark or market rates, and SOFR over time may bear little or no relation to the historical actual or
historical indicative data. It is possible that the volatility of and uncertainty around SOFR as a LIBOR replacement rate and the applicable credit adjustment would result in higher borrowing costs for us, and would adversely affect our liquidity, financial
condition, and earnings. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted and span multiple future periods but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt which may negatively impact our
financial results.

We are subject to credit risk in connection with providing credit to our retail partners, and our results of operations could be harmed if a material number of our retail partners were not able to meet their payment obligations.

We are exposed to credit risk primarily on our accounts receivable. We provide credit to our retail partners in the ordinary course of our business and perform ongoing credit evaluations. While we believe that our exposure to concentrations of credit risk
with respect to trade receivables is mitigated by our large retail partner base, and we make allowances for doubtful accounts, we nevertheless run the risk of our retail partners not being able to meet their payment obligations, particularly in a future economic
downturn. If a material number of our retail partners were not able to meet their payment obligations, our results of operations could be harmed.

If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect or change significantly, our results of operations could be harmed.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities, and equity and the amount of sales and
expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our results of operations may be harmed if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our results of operations to fall below the
expectations of securities analysts and investors and could result in a decline in our stock price.

We may be the target of strategic transactions, which could divert our management's attention and otherwise disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business.

Other companies may seek to acquire us or enter into other strategic transactions. We will consider, discuss, and negotiate such transactions as we deem appropriate. The consideration of such transactions, even if not consummated, could divert
management's attention from other business matters, result in adverse publicity or information leaks, and could increase our expenses.

We may be the target of stockholder activism, an unsolicited takeover proposal or a proxy contest or short sellers, which could negatively impact our business.

In recent years, there has been an increase in proxy contests, unsolicited takeovers and other forms of stockholder activism. We may be subject to such actions or proposals from stockholders or others that may not align with our business strategies or the
interests of our other stockholders. If such a campaign or proposal were to be made against us, we would likely incur substantial costs, such as legal fees and expenses, and divert management's and our Board's attention and resources from our businesses and
strategic plans. Stockholder activists may also seek to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction and operations of our business through stockholder proposals, which could create perceived uncertainties or concerns as to our future operating
environment, legislative environment, strategy, direction, or leadership. Any such uncertainties or concerns could result in the loss of potential business opportunities, harm our business and financial relationships, and harm our ability to attract or retain
investors, customers and employees. Actions of activist stockholders may also cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals
and prospects of our business. We may also be the target of short sellers who engage in negative publicity campaigns that may use selective information that may be presented out of context or that may misrepresent facts and circumstances. Any of the
foregoing could adversely affect our business and operating results.

We may acquire or invest in other companies, which could divert our management's attention, result in dilution to our stockholders, and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our results of operations.

In the future, we may acquire or invest in businesses, products, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our business, enhance our capabilities, or otherwise offer growth opportunities. The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert
the attention of management and cause us to incur various costs and expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated.

In any future acquisitions, we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired personnel, operations, and technologies, or effectively manage the combined business following the acquisition. We also may not achieve the anticipated benefits from future
acquisitions due to a number of factors, including: (a) an inability to integrate or benefit from acquisitions in a profitable manner; (b) unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisition; (c) the incurrence of acquisition-related costs; (d) the
diversion of management's attention from other business concerns; (e) the loss of our or the acquired business' key employees; or (f) the issuance of dilutive equity securities, the incurrence of debt, or the use of cash to fund such acquisitions.

In addition, a significant portion of the purchase price of companies we acquire may be allocated to acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, which must be assessed for impairment at least annually. In the future, if our acquisitions do not yield
expected returns, we may be required to take charges to our results of operations based on this impairment assessment process, which could harm our results of operations.

Headquartered in Austin, Texas, YETI is a global designer, retailer, and distributor of innovative outdoor products. From coolers and drinkware to bags and apparel, YETI products are built to meet the unique and varying needs of diverse outdoor pursuits,
whether in the remote wilderness, at the beach, or anywhere life takes you. By consistently delivering high-performing, exceptional products, we have built a strong following of brand loyalists throughout the world, ranging from serious outdoor enthusiasts to
individuals who simply value products of uncompromising quality and design. We have an unwavering commitment to outdoor and recreation communities, and we are relentless in our pursuit of building superior products for people to confidently enjoy life
outdoors and beyond.

We distribute our products through a balanced omni-channel platform, consisting of our wholesale and direct-to-consumer ("DTC") channels. In our wholesale channel, we sell our products through select national and regional accounts and an assemblage
of independent retail partners throughout the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and Japan, among others. We carefully evaluate and select retail partners that have an image and approach that are consistent with our premium brand and
pricing. Our domestic national and regional specialty retailers include Dick's Sporting Goods, REI, Academy Sports + Outdoors, Bass Pro Shops, Ace Hardware, and Scheels. We sell our products in our DTC channel to customers on YETI.com, country and
region specific YETI websites, and YETI Authorized on the Amazon Marketplace, as well as in our retail stores. Additionally, we offer customized products with licensed marks and original artwork through our corporate sales program and at YETI.com. Our
corporate sales program offers customized products to corporate customers for a wide-range of events and activities, and in certain instances may also offer products to re-sell.

Product Introductions and Updates

During the first quarter of 2022, our new product launches included the Hopperยฎ M20 Soft Backpack Cooler, improved Hopperยฎ M30 Soft Cooler, and two new sizes of the Caminoโข Carryall as well as new seasonal colorways. During the third quarter
of 2022, we expanded our wheeled cooler offerings with the launch of the Roadie Wheeled Cooler in two sizes, and introduced new seasonal colorways and a new Rambler Colster size for our international markets. During the fourth quarter, we further
expanded our Drinkware offerings with the Rambler Straw Mugs in two sizes, and also launched the Yonderโข Water Bottles, our first lightweight water bottles made of durable and safe BPA-free material. During the first quarter of 2022, we strategically
implemented price increases on certain hard coolers and tumblers.

Proposed Voluntary Recalls

In January 2023, we notified the CPSC of a potential safety concern regarding the magnet-lined closures of our Hopper M30 Soft Cooler, Hopperยฎ M20 Soft Backpack Cooler, and SideKick Dry gear case and initiated a global stop sale of the affected
products. In February 2023, we proposed a voluntary recall of the affected products to the CPSC and other relevant global regulatory authorities. In conjunction with the stop sale, we determined that the affected products inventory held by us, our suppliers,
and our wholesale customers is unsalable and notified our wholesale customers to return the affected products. We are working in cooperation with the CPSC and other relevant global regulatory authorities on the corrective action plan and hope to begin
implementing the voluntary recalls in the coming weeks. Once our proposed voluntary recall plans are approved, consumers will have the ability to return the affected products for a remedy. We are also working on solutions to address the potential safety
concern of the affected products and intend to resume the sale of the redesigned products in the fourth quarter of 2023. However, there are a number of factors that could impact our ability to resume sales at that time and our estimate of the date for sales of the
redesigned products to resume may change.

We re-evaluate our estimates on an on-going basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results may differ from these estimates and could differ based upon other assumptions or conditions.

See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for our significant accounting policies. The following describes significant judgments and estimates used in the application of these policies. Within the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported.

**Revenue Recognition**

Revenue transactions associated with the sale of YETI branded coolers, equipment, drinkware, apparel and accessories comprise a single performance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to customers either through our wholesale or DTC channels. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied through the transfer of control of promised goods to the customers, based on the terms of sale. The transfer of control typically occurs at a point in time based on consideration of when the customer has an obligation to pay for the goods, and physical possession of, legal title to, and the risks and rewards of ownership of the goods has been transferred, and the customer has accepted the goods. Revenue from wholesale transactions is generally recognized at the time products are shipped based on contractual terms with the customer. Revenue from our DTC channel is generally recognized at the point of sale in our retail stores and at the time products are shipped for e-commerce transactions and corporate sales based on contractual terms with the customer.

Revenue is recognized net of estimates of variable consideration, including product returns, customer discounts and allowances, sales incentive programs, and miscellaneous claims from customers. We determine these estimates based on contract terms, evaluations of historical experience, anticipated trends, and other factors. The actual amount of customer returns and customer allowances, which is inherently uncertain, may differ from our estimates.

The duration of contractual arrangements with our customers is typically less than 1 year. Payment terms with wholesale customers vary depending on creditworthiness and other considerations, with the most common being net 30 days. Payment is due at the time of sale for retail store transactions and at the time of shipment for e-commerce transactions.

Certain products that we sell include a limited warranty which does not meet the definition of a performance obligation within the context of the contract. Product warranty costs are estimated based on historical and anticipated trends and are recorded as cost of goods sold at the time revenue is recognized.

We elected to account for shipping and handling as fulfillment activities, and not as separate performance obligations. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in net sales. All shipping and handling activity costs are recognized as selling, general and administrative expenses at the time the related revenue is recognized. Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted directly to government authorities are excluded from net sales and cost of goods sold.

Our terms of sale provide limited return rights. We may accept, and have at times accepted, returns outside our terms of sale at our sole discretion. We may also, at our sole discretion, provide our retail partners with sales discounts and allowances. We
record estimated sales returns, discounts, and miscellaneous customer claims as reductions to net sales at the time revenues are recorded. We base our estimates upon historical experience and trends, and upon approval of specific returns or discounts. Actual
returns and discounts in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns and discounts were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or
increase to net sales in the period in which we made such determination. A 10% change in our estimated reserve for sales returns, discounts, and miscellaneous claims for 2022 would have impacted net sales by $1.0 million.

### Product Recall Reserves

As described in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in January 2023, we notified the CPSC of a potential safety concern regarding the magnet-lined closures of our Hopperยฎ M30 Soft Cooler, Hopperยฎ M20 Soft Backpack Cooler,
and SideKick Dry gear case (the "affected products") and initiated a global stop sale of the affected products. In February 2023, we proposed a voluntary recall of the affected products to the CPSC, and other relevant global regulatory authorities, which we
refer to as the "voluntary recalls" herein unless otherwise indicated. In conjunction with the stop sale, we determined that the affected products inventory held by us, our suppliers and our wholesale customers is unsalable, and notified our wholesale customers
to return the affected products. We are working in cooperation with the CPSC and other relevant global regulatory authorities on the corrective action plan and hope to begin implementing the voluntary recalls in the coming weeks. Once our proposed
voluntary recall plans are approved, consumers will have the ability to return the affected products for a remedy.

We establish reserves for the estimated costs of a product recall when circumstances giving rise to the recall become known and when such costs are probable and estimable. As a result of the voluntary recalls, we established a reserve for expected future
returns and the estimated cost of recall remedies for consumers with affected products. Estimating the cost of recall remedies required significant judgment and is primarily based on i) expected consumer participation rates; and ii) the estimated costs of the
consumer's elected remedy in the proposed voluntary recall, including estimated cost of offered product replacements, logistics costs and other recall-related costs. We will reevaluate these assumptions each period, and the related reserves may be adjusted
when factors indicate that the reserve is either not sufficient to cover or exceeds the estimated product recall expenses. The ultimate impact from the approved voluntary recalls could differ materially from these estimates. The reserve for the estimated product
recall expenses of $94.8 million is included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. In addition, we recorded an inventory reserve or write-off of $34.1 million for our unsalable inventory
on-hand as of December 31, 2022.

### Inventory

Inventories are comprised primarily of finished goods and are carried at the lower of cost (weighted-average cost method) or market (net realizable value). We make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our
assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If the estimated net realizable value is less than cost, we reflect the lower value of that inventory. This methodology recognizes inventory exposures at the time such losses are identified rather than at the
time the inventory is actually sold. Due to customer demand and inventory constraints, we have not historically taken material adjustments to the carrying value of our inventory.

Our inventory valuation reflects adjustments for anticipated inventory losses that have occurred since the last physical inventory. We estimate inventory shrinkage based on historical trends from physical inventory counts and cycle counts. We perform
physical inventory counts and cycle counts throughout the year and adjust the shrink provision accordingly. Historically, physical inventory shrinkage has not been significant.

### Valuation of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

Goodwill and intangible assets are recorded at cost, or at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. We review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying amount may be impaired. In conducting our annual impairment test, we first review qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset, or reporting units, is less than its carrying amount. If factors indicate
that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative assessment, analyzing the expected present value of future cash flows to quantify the amount of impairment, if any. Based on our qualitative assessment performed during the fourth
quarter of 2022, we determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is lower than its carrying value; therefore, the quantitative impairment test was not required. We did not record any goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible
assets impairment charges during the years ended December 31, 2022, January 1, 2022, and January 2, 2021.

Valuation of Long-Lived Assets

We assess the recoverability of our long-lived assets, which include property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use-assets, and definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount
of such assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss on our long-lived assets exists when the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. If the carrying
amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the
carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell.

Income Taxes

We are subject to taxation in the United States, as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax
laws. On an interim basis, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date income before income taxes, excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the
year-to-date income tax expense. The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by
jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year. When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs.

Tax filing positions are evaluated, and we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the tax position. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate
the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, and audit activity. Changes in our
assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes in the
consolidated statements of operations.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

For a description of recent accounting pronouncements, see "Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements" and "Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted" in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

In order to maintain liquidity and fund business operations, our long-term Credit Facility bears a variable interest rate based on prime, federal funds, or LIBOR plus an applicable margin based on our total net leverage ratio. The nature and amount of our
long-term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions, and other factors. We may elect to enter into interest rate swap contracts to reduce the impact associated with interest rate fluctuations, but as of
December 31, 2022, we have not entered into any such contracts. Based on the balance outstanding under our Term Loan A at December 31, 2022, we estimate that a 1% increase or decrease in underlying interest rates would increase or decrease annual
interest expense by $0.9 million in any given fiscal year. See Item 1A, Risk Factors under "The phase-out of LIBOR and transition to SOFR as a benchmark interest rate may negatively impact our financial results." for a discussion of the interest rate risk
related the ongoing phase-out of LIBOR.

Inflation Risk

Inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. During 2022, our gross margin was specifically impacted by higher inbound transportation costs compared to 2021 as a result of
global supply chain disruption and inflationary pressures. Sustained cost increases, or other inflationary pressures in the future, may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain or improve current levels of gross margin and SG&A expenses as a
percentage of net sales if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs, or we cannot identify cost efficiencies.

Commodity Price Risk
The primary raw materials and components used by our contract manufacturing partners include polyethylene, polyurethane foam, stainless-steel, polyester fabric, zippers, and plastic. We believe these materials are readily available from multiple vendors.
We have, and may continue to, negotiate prices with suppliers of these products on behalf of our third-party contract manufacturers in order to leverage the cumulative impact of our volume. We do not, however, source significant amounts of these products
directly. Certain of these products use petroleum or natural gas as inputs. However, we do not believe there is a significant direct correlation between petroleum or natural gas prices and the costs of our products.
Foreign Currency Risk
Our international sales are primarily denominated in the Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Euro, British pound, and New Zealand dollar and any unfavorable movement in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and these currencies could have an
adverse impact on our revenue. During 2022, net sales from our international entities accounted for 11% of our consolidated net sales, and therefore we do not believe exposure to foreign currency fluctuations would have a material impact on our net sales. A
portion of our operating expenses are incurred outside the Unites States and are denominated in foreign currencies, which are also subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In addition, our suppliers may incur many costs,
including labor costs, in other currencies. To the extent that exchange rates move unfavorably for our suppliers, they may seek to pass these additional costs on to us, which could have a material impact on our gross margin. In addition, a strengthening of the
U.S. dollar may increase the cost of our products to our customers outside of the United States. Our operating results and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

# REVIEW OF EMERGENCY REGISTRATION PUBLIC ACT 101-637 EXTENSION

The Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Washington, D.C., hereby amends the final rule published on October 8, 1990, at 55 FR 40862, which added a new section to the Code of Federal Regulations, 38 CFR 3.317, to implement Public Law 101-637, the "Veterans' Benefits Amendments Act of 1990." This rule extends the period during which veterans who served in the Persian Gulf theater of operations may apply for disability compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation for disabilities resulting from undiagnosed illnesses.

**Summary of the Final Rule (Previous and Current)**

The final rule published on October 8, 1990, added a new section to the Code of Federal Regulations, 38 CFR 3.317, to implement Public Law 101-637, the "Veterans' Benefits Amendments Act of 1990." This rule extends the period during which veterans who served in the Persian Gulf theater of operations may apply for disability compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation for disabilities resulting from undiagnosed illnesses.

**Basis for Extension**

The Secretary has determined that it is necessary to extend the period during which veterans who served in the Persian Gulf theater of operations may apply for disability compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation for disabilities resulting from undiagnosed illnesses. This determination is based on the fact that many veterans who served in the Persian Gulf theater of operations have not yet had an opportunity to apply for benefits under the provisions of Public Law 101-637.

**Inclusion of Additional Causes for Financial Reporting**

The Secretary has determined that it is necessary to include additional causes for financial reporting in the final rule. This determination is based on the fact that many veterans who served in the Persian Gulf theater of operations have not yet had an opportunity to apply for benefits under the provisions of Public Law 101-637.

**Effective Date**

This rule is effective on [insert date].

**Applicability Date**

This rule applies to all claims for disability compensation or dependency and indemnity compensation filed on or after [insert date].

**Regulatory Flexibility Act**

The Secretary certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.

**Unfunded Mandates Reform Act**

The Secretary certifies that this rule does not impose an unfunded mandate on State, local, or tribal governments.

**Paperwork Reduction Act**

The Secretary certifies that this rule does not impose any new reporting or recordkeeping requirements.

**Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Numbers**

The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance numbers for this program are 64.100, 64.101, and 64.102.

**Authority**

This rule is issued under the authority of 38 U.S.C. 501(a) and 38 CFR 3.317.

**List of Subjects in 38 CFR Part 3**

Administrative practice and procedure, Claims, Disability benefits, Health, Pensions, Veterans.

**Dated:** [insert date]

[insert name]

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of
changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or
disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial
statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.
Revenue Recognition
As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's revenue is generated from the sale of its products to customers either through wholesale or direct-to-consumer (DTC) channels. Revenue from wholesale transactions is generally
recognized at the time products are shipped based on contractual terms with the customer. Revenue from the DTC channel is generally recognized at the point of sale in retail stores and at the time products are shipped for e-commerce transactions and
corporate sales based on contractual terms with the customer. The Company's consolidated net sales were $1.6 billion for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.
The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition is a critical audit matter is a high degree of audit effort in performing procedures related to the Company's revenue recognition.
Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue
recognition process. These procedures also included, among others, (i) evaluating the recognition of revenue, on a sample basis, by obtaining and inspecting shipping documents and cash receipts, where applicable, and (ii) testing, on a sample basis, the timing
of revenue recognition by obtaining and inspecting shipping documentation.
Product Recall Reserves
As described in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements, in January 2023, the Company initiated a global stop sale of the Hopper M30 Soft Cooler, Hopperยฎ M20 Soft Backpack Cooler, and the SideKick Dry gear case, and in February 2023, the
Company proposed a voluntary recall of these products to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission ("CPSC"). Management establishes reserves for the estimated costs of a product recall when such costs are probable and estimable. Estimating the cost
of recall remedies required significant judgment by management and is primarily based on i) expected consumer participation rates; and ii) the estimated costs of the consumer's elected remedy in the proposed voluntary recall, including estimated cost of
offered product replacements, logistics costs and other recall-related costs. As a result of the global stop sale and proposed voluntary product recalls, the Company recorded an inventory reserve or write-off of $34.1 million for unsalable inventory on-hand as
of December 31, 2022, and recorded a reserve for the estimated product recall expenses of $94.8 million, which is included within accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.
The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to product recall reserves is a critical audit matter are the significant judgments by management when developing the estimate of the product recall reserves, which in turn
led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and in evaluating management's significant assumption related to expected consumer participation rates.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to
management's estimate of the product recall reserves, including the controls over the significant assumption related to expected consumer participation rates. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management's process for developing the
estimate of the product recall reserves, (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology applied by the Company in estimating the product recall reserves, (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the estimate of the
product recall reserves, and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumption used by management related to the expected consumer participation rates. Evaluating management's assumption related to the expected consumer participation rates
involved evaluating whether the assumption used by management was reasonable considering historical experience with product recalls and whether the assumption was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.

Foreign Currency Translation and Foreign Currency Transactions
Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment, a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
For consolidation purposes, the assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average
rates prevailing during the period. The gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
Goodwill and intangible assets are recorded at cost, or at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. We review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or on an interim basis
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount. In conducting our annual impairment test, we first review qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair
value of the asset is less than its carrying amount. If factors indicate that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount, we perform a quantitative assessment of the asset, analyzing the expected present value of future cash flows to quantify the
amount of impairment, if any. We perform our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.
For our annual goodwill impairment tests in the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2021, we performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether the fair value of goodwill was more likely than not less than the carrying value. Based on economic conditions
and industry and market considerations, we determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of goodwill was greater than its carrying value; therefore, the quantitative impairment test was not performed. Therefore, we did not record any goodwill
impairment for the years 2022 and 2021.
Our intangible assets consist of indefinite-lived intangible assets, including tradename, trademarks, trade dress, and definite-lived intangible assets such as customer relationships, trademarks, patents, and other intangibles assets, such as copyrights and
domain name. We also capitalize the costs of acquired trademarks, trade dress, patents and other intangibles, such as copyrights and domain name assets.
In addition, external legal costs incurred in the defense of our patents and trademarks are capitalized when we believe that the future economic benefit of the intangible asset will be increased, and a successful defense is probable. In the event of a
successful defense, the settlements received are netted against the external legal costs that were capitalized. Capitalized patent and trademark defense costs are amortized over the remaining useful life of the asset. Where the defense of the patent and trademark
maintains rather than increases the expected future economic benefits from the asset, the costs would generally be expensed as incurred. The external legal costs incurred and settlements received may not occur in the same period. Capitalized costs incurred
during 2022, 2021, and 2020 primarily relate to external legal costs incurred in the defense of our patents and trademarks, net of settlements received.
Income Taxes
We provide for income taxes at the enacted rate applicable for the appropriate tax jurisdictions. Deferred taxes are provided on an asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future
consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than
not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
Tax filing positions are evaluated, and we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the tax position. Settlements with tax authorities,
the expiration of statutes of limitations for particular tax positions, or obtaining new information on particular tax positions may cause a change to the effective tax rate. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for
income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations.

**Inventories**

Inventories, consisting primarily of finished goods and an immaterial level of component parts, are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using weighted-average costs, including all costs incurred to deliver inventory to our distribution facilities, such as inbound freight, import duties and tariffs. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. We make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. At December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, inventory reserves were $37.3 million and $3.1 million, respectively. In connection with our voluntary recalls, we recorded an inventory write-off, or reserve, of $34.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 11 for further discussion of our voluntary recalls.

**Property and Equipment**

We record property and equipment at their original acquisition costs and we depreciate them based on a straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. We capitalize direct internal and external costs related to software used for internal purposes. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred, while asset improvements that extend the useful life are capitalized. The useful lives for property and equipment are as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Leasehold improvements</td>
    <td>lesser of 10 years, remaining lease term, or estimated useful life of the asset</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Molds and tooling</td>
    <td>3 - 5 years</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Furniture and equipment</td>
    <td>3 - 7 years</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Computers and software</td>
    <td>3 - 7 years</td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Related-Party Agreements**

We lease warehouse and office facilities under various operating leases. One warehouse facility is leased from an entity owned by our founders, brothers Roy and Ryan Seiders. The warehouse facility lease, which is month-to-month and can be cancelled upon 30 days' written notice, requires monthly payments of $8,700 that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations.

**Research and Development Costs**

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of employee compensation, including non-cash stock-based compensation expense, and miscellaneous supplies. Research and development costs are recorded in selling, general, and administrative expenses. Research and development expenses were $15.4 million, $13.7 million, and $11.2 million, for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

**Revenue Recognition**

Revenue transactions associated with the sale of our products comprise a single performance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or DTC channels. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations are satisfied through the transfer of control of promised goods to the customers, based on the terms of sale. The transfer of control typically occurs at a point in time based on consideration of when the customer has an obligation to pay for the goods, and physical possession of, legal title to, and the risks and rewards of ownership of the goods has been transferred, and the customer has accepted the goods. Revenue from wholesale transactions is generally recognized at the time products are shipped based on contractual terms with the customer. Revenue from our DTC channel is generally recognized at the point of sale in our retail stores and at the time products are shipped for e-commerce transactions and corporate sales based on contractual terms with the customer.

Revenue is recognized net of estimates of variable consideration, including product returns, customer discounts and allowances, sales incentive programs, and miscellaneous claims from customers. We determine these estimates based on contract terms, evaluations of historical experience, anticipated trends, and other factors. The actual amount of customer returns and customer allowances, which is inherently uncertain, may differ from our estimates.

The duration of contractual arrangements with our customers is typically less than 1 year. Payment terms with wholesale customers vary depending on creditworthiness and other considerations, with the most common being net 30 days. Payment is due at the time of sale for retail store transactions and at the time of shipment for e-commerce transactions.

Certain products that we sell include a limited warranty which does not meet the definition of a performance obligation within the context of the contract. Product warranty costs are estimated based on historical and anticipated trends and are recorded as
cost of goods sold at the time revenue is recognized.

We elected to account for shipping and handling as fulfillment activities, and not as separate performance obligations. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in net sales. All shipping and handling activity costs are recognized as
selling, general and administrative expenses at the time the related revenue is recognized. Sales taxes collected from customers and remitted directly to government authorities are excluded from net sales and cost of goods sold.

Our terms of sale provide limited return rights. We may accept, and have at times accepted, returns outside our terms of sale at our sole discretion. We may also, at our sole discretion, provide our retail partners with sales discounts and allowances. We
record estimated sales returns, discounts, and miscellaneous customer claims as reductions to net sales at the time revenues are recorded. We base our estimates upon historical experience and trends, and upon approval of specific returns or discounts. Actual
returns and discounts in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates. If actual or expected future returns and discounts were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established, we would record a reduction or
increase to net sales in the period in which we made such determination.

## Segment Information

We report our operations as a single reportable segment and manage our business as a single-brand consumer products business. This is supported by our operational structure, which includes sales, research, product design, operations, marketing, and
administrative functions focused on the entire product suite rather than individual product categories. Our chief operating decision maker does not regularly review financial information for individual product categories, sales channels, or geographic regions
that would allow decisions to be made about allocation of resources or performance.

## Shipping and Handling Costs

Amounts charged to customers for shipping and handling are included in net sales. Our cost of goods sold includes inbound freight charges for product delivery from our third-party contract manufacturers. The cost of product shipment to our customers,
which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations, was $114.8 million, $89.7 million, and $62.7 million for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

## Stock-Based Compensation

Stock-based compensation awards granted to employees and directors are measured at fair value and recognized as an expense. Compensation expense equal to the fair value of performance-based awards that are expected to vest is estimated and recorded
over the period the grants are earned, which is the vesting period. Compensation expense estimates are updated periodically. The vesting of the performance-based restricted stock units is also contingent upon the attainment of predetermined performance
goals. Depending on the estimated probability of attainment of those performance goals, the compensation expense recognized related to the awards could increase or decrease over the remaining vesting period.

The grant date fair value of restricted stock units, restricted stock awards, and deferred stock units is based on the closing price of our common stock on the award date, the grant date fair value of performance-based restricted stock awards is estimated on
the award date using a Monte Carlo simulation model, and the grant date fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the award date using the Black-Scholes model. The Monte Carlo simulation and Black-Scholes model require various judgmental
assumptions including volatility, forfeiture rates and expected option life. No stock options were granted in 2022, 2021, or 2020.

Costs relating to stock-based compensation are recognized in selling, general, and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations, and forfeitures are recognized as they occur. See Note 9 for further discussion.

## Valuation of Long-Lived Assets

We assess the recoverability of our long-lived assets, which include property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use-assets, and definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount
of such assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss on our long-lived assets exists when the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. If the carrying
amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the
carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell.

## Warranty
Warranty liabilities are recorded at the time of sale for the estimated costs that may be incurred under the terms of our limited warranty. We make and revise these estimates primarily based on the number of units under warranty, historical experience of warranty claims, and an estimated per unit replacement cost. The liability for warranties is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The specific warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold, but are generally warranted against defects in material and workmanship ranging from three to five years. Our warranty only applies to the original owner. If actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liabilities would be required and could materially affect our financial condition and operating results. Warranty reserves were $10.0 million and $10.3 million as of December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, respectively. Warranty costs included in costs of goods sold were $5.8 million, $6.9 million, and $5.1 million for 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

## Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2019-12, *Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes*. ASU 2019-12 is intended to simplify various aspects related to the accounting for income taxes and removes certain exceptions to the general principles of Topic 740 and amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. We adopted this standard effective January 3, 2021 using the modified retrospective approach. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

## Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted
In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2020-04, *Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting*. The ASU is intended to ease the potential accounting and financial reporting burden of reference rate reform, including the expected market transition from the LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance provides optional expedients and scope exceptions for transactions if certain criteria are met. These transactions include contract modifications, hedge accounting, and the sale or transfer of debt securities classified as held-to-maturity. The ASU can be adopted no later than December 31, 2024 with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance. The impact of this guidance on our financial statements and related disclosures will continue to be evaluated through the application period and is not expected to be material.

In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, *Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50) - Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations*, which requires disclosures intended to enhance the transparency of supplier finance programs. The ASU requires buyers in a supplier finance program to disclose sufficient information about the program to allow a user of financial statements to understand the program's nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our disclosures.

## 2. REVENUE
### Contract Balances
Accounts receivable represent an unconditional right to receive consideration from a customer and are recorded at net invoiced amounts, less an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts.

Contract liabilities are recorded when the customer pays consideration before the transfer of a good to the customer and thus represent our obligation to transfer the good to the customer at a future date. Our contract liabilities relate to advance cash deposits received from customers for certain customized product orders. As products are shipped and control transfers, we recognize contract liabilities as revenue.

At December 31, 2022, the future maturities of principal amounts of our debt obligations, excluding finance lease obligations, for the next two years and in total (see Note 5 for future maturities of finance lease obligations), consisted of the following (in thousands):

|       | Amount  |
| :---- | :------ |
| 2023  | 22,500  |
| 2024  | 67,500  |
| Total | $ 90,000 |

**Credit Facility**

In May 2016, we entered into a senior secured credit agreement that provided for: (a) a $100.0 million Revolving Credit Facility maturing on May 19, 2021 ("Revolving Credit Facility"); (b) a $45.0 million term loan A maturing on May 19, 2021 ("Term Loan A"); and (c) a $105.0 million term loan B maturing on May 19, 2022 ("Term Loan B") (together with amendments described below, the "Credit Facility"). During 2019, we voluntarily repaid in full the principal amount outstanding under Term Loan B. A commitment fee of between 0.175% and 0.375% is determined by reference to a pricing grid based our net leverage ratio and is payable on the average daily unused amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings made under the Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate based on the LIBOR plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for LIBOR rate borrowings is also determined by reference to the pricing grid, and ranges from 1.75% to 2.75%. The Credit Facility additionally provides for the replacement of LIBOR with one or more rates based on SOFR or another alternate benchmark rate promptly after a determination by the Administrative Agent, Borrower or Required Lenders (each as defined therein) that: (i) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining LIBOR for any requested interest period, including because LIBOR is not available or published on a current basis and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; (ii) the administrator of LIBOR has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which LIBOR shall no longer be made available or used for determining the interest rate of loans; provided that at the time of such statement, there is no successor administrator that is satisfactory to the Administrative Agent that will continue to provide LIBOR after such specific date; or (iii) syndicated loans made under the Credit Agreement are executed or amended to incorporate or adopt a new benchmark interest rate to replace LIBOR.

On July 15, 2017, we amended the Credit Facility to reset the net leverage ratio covenant for the period ending June 2017 and thereafter, and we incurred 8.0 million in additional deferred financing fees.

On December 17, 2019, we further amended our Credit Facility which increased the remaining principal amount of Term Loan A from approximately $298.0 million to $300.0 million; increased the commitments under the revolving credit facility from $100.0 million to $150.0 million; extended the maturity date of both Term Loan A and the revolving credit facility from May 19, 2021 to December 17, 2024; revised the leverage ratios and reduced the interest rates spreads and commitment fee payable on the average daily unused amount of the revolving commitment; and revised the scheduled quarterly principal payments of Term Loan A to 1.25% of the remaining aggregate principal amount of Term Loan A for the first year, and 1.875% for the second year and thereafter until the maturity date. As a result of the amendment, we recognized a $0.6 million loss on modification and extinguishment of debt and we capitalized $2.1 million of new lender and third-party fees in the fourth quarter of 2019.

In March 2020, we drew down $50.0 million from our $150.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. This action was a precautionary measure to enhance our liquidity position and to increase available cash on hand in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the second quarter of 2020, we repaid in full the $50.0 million borrowed under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2022 and January 1, 2022, we hadno borrowings outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility.

The following is

# Page 71 of 80

The image is a page of text, likely from a book or document, with a white background and black text. The text is in a serif font and appears to be a formal or academic writing style. There are no images or graphics on the page.

The text is divided into paragraphs, with each paragraph indented slightly from the left margin. The paragraphs are separated by a blank line, creating a clear visual distinction between them.

At the top of the page, there is a small blue line that runs across the width of the page. This line may be a header or footer element, but its exact purpose is unclear without more context.

Overall, the image presents a clean and organized layout, with a focus on the text content. The use of a serif font and indented paragraphs suggests a formal or traditional writing style, while the lack of images or graphics keeps the focus on the text itself.

**Step 1: Identify the content to be converted**

The image contains a page with text and tables. The text is in a clear, readable font, and the tables are well-structured.

**Step 2: Convert the text to Markdown**

To convert the text to Markdown, we need to identify the headings, paragraphs, and other elements. We can use the following syntax:

* Headings: `# Heading`
* Paragraphs: `This is a paragraph of text.`
* Bold text: `**Bold text**`
* Italic text: `*Italic text*`
* Links: `[Link text](http://www.example.com)`
* Images: `![Image alt text](http://www.example.com/image.jpg)`

**Step 3: Convert the tables to HTML**

To convert the tables to HTML, we can use the following syntax:

* Table: `<table>`
* Table row: `<tr>`
* Table cell: `<td>`

We can use the following HTML code to represent the tables:

```
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Column 1</td>
    <td>Column 2</td>
    <td>Column 3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 1, Column 1</td>
    <td>Row 1, Column 2</td>
    <td>Row 1, Column 3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 2, Column 1</td>
    <td>Row 2, Column 2</td>
    <td>Row 2, Column 3</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

**Step 4: Combine the Markdown and HTML code**

Once we have converted the text to Markdown and the tables to HTML, we can combine the code into a single Markdown file.

**Answer**: 

# Heading

This is a paragraph of text.

**Bold text**

*Italic text*

[Link text](http://www.example.com)

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Column 1</td>
    <td>Column 2</td>
    <td>Column 3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 1, Column 1</td>
    <td>Row 1, Column 2</td>
    <td>Row 1, Column 3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 2, Column 1</td>
    <td>Row 2, Column 2</td>
    <td>Row 2, Column 3</td>
  </tr>
</table>
