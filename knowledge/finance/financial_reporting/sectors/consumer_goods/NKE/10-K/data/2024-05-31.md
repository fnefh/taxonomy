# PART I
## ITEM 1. BUSINESS
### GENERAL
NIKE, Inc. was incorporated in 1967 under the laws of the State of Oregon. As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Annual Report"), the terms "we," "us," "our," "NIKE" and
the "Company" refer to NIKE, Inc. and its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates, collectively, unless the context indicates otherwise.

Our principal business activity is the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE is the largest
seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. We sell our products through NIKE Direct operations, which are comprised of both NIKE-owned retail stores and sales through our
digital platforms (also referred to as "NIKE Brand Digital") and to wholesale accounts, which include a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in nearly all
countries around the world. We also offer interactive consumer services and experiences through our digital platforms. Nearly all of our products are manufactured by independent
contractors. Nearly all footwear and apparel products are manufactured outside the United States, while equipment products are manufactured both in the United States and abroad.

All references to fiscal 2025, 2024, 2023, 2022 and 2021 are to NIKE, Inc.'s fiscal years ended May 31, 2025, 2024, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Any references to other fiscal
years refer to a fiscal year ending on May 31 of that year.
### PRODUCTS
Our NIKE Brand product offerings are aligned around our consumer construct focused on Men's, Women's and Kids'. We also design products specifically for the Jordan Brand and
Converse. We believe this approach allows us to create products that better meet individual consumer needs while accelerating our largest growth opportunities.

NIKE's athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use, although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes. We place
considerable emphasis on innovation and high-quality construction in the development and manufacturing of our products.

We also sell sports apparel, which features the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and distribution channels as athletic footwear. Our sports
apparel, similar to our athletic footwear products, is designed primarily for athletic use, although many of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes, and demonstrates our
commitment to innovation and high-quality construction. We often market footwear, apparel and accessories in "collections" of similar use or by category. We also market apparel with
licensed college and professional team and league logos.

We sell a line of performance equipment and accessories under the NIKE Brand name, including bags, socks, sport balls, eyewear, timepieces, digital devices, bats, gloves, protective
equipment and other equipment designed for sports activities. We also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our wholly-owned subsidiary,
NIKE IHM, Inc., doing business as Air Manufacturing Innovation.

Our Jordan Brand designs, distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories predominantly focused on basketball performance and culture using the
Jumpman trademark. Sales and operating results for Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments.

Our wholly-owned subsidiary brand, Converse, headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, designs, distributes and licenses casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the
Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.

In addition to the products we sell to our wholesale customers and directly to consumers through our NIKE Direct operations, we have also entered into license agreements that permit
unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell, using NIKE-owned trademarks, certain apparel, digital devices and applications and other equipment designed for sports activities.

We also offer interactive consumer services and experiences as well as digital products through our digital platforms, including fitness and activity apps; sport, fitness and wellness
content; and digital services and features in retail stores that enhance the consumer experience.

# SALES AND MARKETING
We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as other macroeconomic, strategic, operating and logistics-related factors.

Because NIKE is a consumer products company, the relative popularity and availability of various sports and fitness activities, as well as changing design trends and consumer preferences, affect the demand for our products. We must, therefore, respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings and channels, developing new products, styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing. Failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability. This is a continuing risk. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors.

# OUR MARKETS
We report our NIKE Brand operations based on our internal geographic organization. Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Company's reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East & Africa ("EMEA"); Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America ("APLA"), and include results for the NIKE and Jordan brands. Sales through our NIKE Direct operations are managed within each geographic operating segment.

Converse is also a reportable operating segment and operates predominately in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of casual sneakers, apparel and accessories. Converse direct to consumer operations, including digital commerce, are reported within the Converse operating segment results.

# UNITED STATES MARKET
For fiscal 2024, NIKE Brand and Converse sales in the United States accounted for approximately 42% of total revenues, compared to 43% and 40% for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively. We sell our products to thousands of wholesale accounts in the United States, including a mix of footwear stores, sporting goods stores, athletic specialty stores, department stores, skate, tennis and golf shops and other wholesale accounts. In the United States, we utilize NIKE sales offices to solicit such sales. During fiscal 2024, our three largest United States customers accounted for approximately 21% of sales in the United States.

Our NIKE Direct and Converse direct to consumer operations sell our products to consumers through various digital platforms. In addition, our NIKE Direct and Converse direct to consumer operations sell products through the following number of retail stores in the United States:

For fiscal 2024, non-U.S. NIKE Brand and Converse sales accounted for approximately 58% of total revenues, compared to 57% and 60% for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively.
We sell our products through NIKE Direct operations and to wholesale accounts, which include a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives around the
world. We sell to thousands of retail accounts and ship products from 68 distribution centers outside of the United States. Refer to Item 2. Properties for additional information on
distribution facilities outside of the United States. During fiscal 2024, NIKE's three largest customers outside of the United States accounted for approximately 15% of total non-
U.S. sales.

In addition to NIKE-owned and Converse-owned digital commerce platforms in over 40 countries, our NIKE Direct and Converse direct to consumer businesses operate the following

# SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER
No customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net Revenues during fiscal 2024.

# PRODUCT RESEARCH, DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
We believe our research, design and development efforts are key factors in our success. Technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear, apparel and
athletic equipment receives continued emphasis as we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance, reduce injury and maximize comfort, while decreasing our
environmental impact.

In addition to our own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, digital technologies, industrial design, sustainability and related
fields, we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists, physicians and other experts
who consult with us and review certain designs, materials and concepts for product and manufacturing, design and other process improvements and compliance with product safety
regulations around the world. Employee athletes, athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes wear-test and evaluate products during the design and
development process.

As we continue to develop new technologies, we are simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products and experiences incorporating such technologies throughout our
product categories and consumer applications. Using market intelligence and research, our various design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing
categories to respond to consumer preferences. The proliferation of Nike Air, Zoom, Free, Dri-FIT, Flyknit, FlyEase, ZoomX, Air Max, and React technologies, among others, typifies
our dedication to designing innovative products.

# MANUFACTURING
Nearly all of our footwear and apparel products are manufactured outside the United States by independent contract manufacturers ("contract manufacturers"), many of which operate
multiple factories. We are also supplied, primarily indirectly, by a number of materials, or "Tier 2" suppliers, who provide the principal materials used in footwear and apparel finished
goods products. As of May 31, 2024, we had 169 strategic Tier 2 suppliers.

As of May 31, 2024, our contract manufacturers operated 96 finished goods footwear factories located in 11 countries. For fiscal 2024, NIKE Brand footwear finished goods were
manufactured by 15 contract manufacturers, many of which operate multiple factories. The largest single finished goods footwear factory accounted for approximately 9% of total fiscal
2024 NIKE Brand footwear production. For fiscal 2024, factories in Vietnam, Indonesia and China manufactured approximately 50%, 27% and 18% of total NIKE Brand footwear,
respectively. For fiscal 2024, four footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10% of footwear production and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 57%
of NIKE Brand footwear production.

As of May 31, 2024, our contract manufacturers operated 285 finished goods apparel factories located in 33 countries. For fiscal 2024, NIKE Brand apparel finished goods were
manufactured by 68 contract manufacturers, many of which operate multiple factories. The largest single finished goods apparel factory accounted for approximately 9% of total fiscal
2024 NIKE Brand apparel production. For fiscal 2024, factories in Vietnam, China and Cambodia manufactured approximately 28%, 16% and 15%

Table of Contents

of total NIKE Brand apparel, respectively. For fiscal 2024, one apparel contract manufacturer accounted for more than 10% of apparel production, and the top five contract
manufacturers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 51% of NIKE Brand apparel production.
NIKE's contract manufacturers buy raw materials for the manufacturing of our footwear, apparel and equipment products. Most raw materials are available and purchased by those
contract manufacturers in the countries where manufacturing takes place.
The principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon, polyester
and natural fiber textiles, as well as polyurethane films used to make NIKE Air-Sole cushioning components. During fiscal 2024, Air Manufacturing Innovation, a wholly-owned
subsidiary, with facilities near Beaverton, Oregon, in Dong Nai Province, Vietnam, and St. Charles, Missouri, as well as contract manufacturers in China and Vietnam, were our
suppliers of NIKE Air-Sole and other cushioning components used in footwear.
The principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics, yarns and threads (both virgin and recycled); specialized performance fabrics designed to
efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat and repel rain and/or snow; and plastic and metal hardware.
From time to time, certain materials used in the production of our products experience periods of high demand, shortages and price volatility. In fiscal 2024, contract manufacturers
were able to source sufficient quantities of raw materials for use in our footwear and apparel products. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors, for additional discussion of the impact of
sourcing risks on our business.
Since 1972, Sojitz Corporation of America ("Sojitz America"), a large Japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock, has performed import-export
financing services for us.
INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AND TRADE
Our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad, such as the implementation of, or potential changes in, foreign and
domestic trade policies, increases in import duties, anti-dumping measures, quotas, safeguard measures, trade restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds and, in certain parts of
the world, political tensions, instability, conflicts, nationalism and terrorism, and resulting sanctions and other measures imposed in response to such issues. We have not, to date,
been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future.
In recent years, uncertain global and regional economic and political conditions have affected international trade and increased protectionist actions around the world. These trends
are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our industry are facing trade
protectionism in many different regions, and, in nearly all cases, we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry, while
observing applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products, and additional measures, if
implemented, could adversely affect sales and/or profitability for NIKE, as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole.
We monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry, and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate
trade restrictions. We are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional anti-dumping measures and could affect our industry. We are also monitoring for and advocating
against other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear, apparel and equipment. NIKE also advocates for trade liberalization for footwear and
apparel in a number of bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements. Changes in, and responses to, U.S. trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs or penalties on imported
goods or retaliatory measures by other countries, have negatively affected, and could in the future negatively affect, U.S. corporations, including NIKE, with business operations and/or
consumer markets in those countries, which could also make it necessary for us to change the way we conduct business, either of which may have an adverse effect on our business,
financial condition or our results of operations. In addition, with respect to proposed trade restrictions, we work with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations
representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented (i) addresses legitimate and core concerns, (ii) is consistent with international trade
rules and (iii) reflects and considers domestic economies and the important role they may play in the global economic community.
Where trade protection measures are implemented, we believe we have the ability to develop, over a period of time, adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained
from our present suppliers. If events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country, our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could
experience an adverse financial impact. However, we believe we could abate any such disruption, and that much of the adverse impact on supply would, therefore, be of a short-term
nature, although alternate sources of supply might not be as cost-effective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability.

Our international operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA"), and other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations. We
source a significant portion of our products from, and have important consumer markets, outside of the United States. We have an ethics and compliance program to address
compliance with the FCPA and similar laws by us, our employees, agents, suppliers and other partners. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information on risks relating to our
international operations.

# COMPETITION

The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis. We compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear
companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel and equipment,
including adidas, Anta, ASICS, Deckers, Li Ning, lululemon athletica, New Balance, On, Puma, Under Armour and V.F. Corporation, among others. The intense competition and the
rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our
operations. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information.

NIKE is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world. Important aspects of competition in this industry are:

*   Product attributes such as quality; innovation and development; performance and reliability; new product style, and design; as well as consumer price/value.
*   Consumer connection, engagement and affinity for brands and products, developed through marketing, promotion and digital experiences; social media interaction; customer
    support and service; identification with prominent and influential athletes, influencers, public figures, coaches, teams, colleges and sports leagues who endorse our brands and
    use our products and active engagement through sponsored sporting events and clinics.
*   Effective sourcing and distribution of products, with attractive merchandising and presentation at retail, both in-store and on digital platforms.

We believe that we are competitive in all of these areas. See Item 1A. Risk Factors, including the risk factor titled "Our products, services and experiences face intense competition."

# TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS

We believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our brand, our success and our competitive position. We strategically pursue available protections of these rights and
vigorously protect and enforce them against third-party theft and infringement.

We use trademarks on nearly all of our products and packaging, and in our marketing materials, and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor
in creating a market for our goods, in identifying our brands and the Company, and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others. We consider our NIKE and Swoosh Design
trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in over 190 jurisdictions worldwide. In addition, we own many other trademarks that we
use in marketing our products. Throughout the world, we own common law rights in the trade dress of several distinctive shoe designs and elements. For certain trade dress, we have
sought and obtained trademark registrations.

We have copyright protection in our designs, graphics, software applications, digital goods and other original works. When appropriate, we also obtain registered copyrights.

We file for, own and maintain many U.S. and foreign utility and design patents protecting components, technologies, materials, manufacturing techniques, features, functionality, and
industrial designs used in and for the manufacture of various athletic, performance, and leisure footwear and apparel, including physical and digital versions thereof, athletic
equipment, and digital devices, and related software applications. These patents expire at various times.

We believe our success depends upon our capabilities in areas such as design, research and development, production and marketing and is supported and protected by our
intellectual property rights, such as trademarks, utility and design patents, copyrights, and trade secrets, among others.

We have followed a policy of applying for and registering intellectual property rights in the United States and select foreign countries on trademarks, inventions, innovations and
designs that we deem protectable and valuable. We also continue to vigorously protect and enforce our intellectual property, including trademarks, patents and trade secrets against
third-party infringement and misappropriation.

# HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
At NIKE, we consider the strength and effective management of our workforce to be essential to the ongoing success of our business. We believe that it is important to attract, develop
and retain a diverse and engaged workforce at all levels of our business and that such a workforce fosters creativity and accelerates innovation. We are focused on building a talent
pipeline that reflects our consumers, athletes and the communities we serve.
# CULTURE
Each employee shapes NIKE's culture through behaviors and practices. This starts with our Maxims, which represent our core values and, along with our Code of Conduct, feature the
fundamental behaviors that help anchor, inform and guide us and apply to all employees. Our mission is to bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world, which includes
the belief that if you have a body, you are an athlete. We aim to do this by creating groundbreaking sport innovations, making our products more sustainably, building a creative and
diverse global team, supporting the well-being of our employees and making a positive impact in communities where we live and work. Our mission is aligned with our deep
commitment to maintaining an environment where all NIKE employees have the opportunity to reach their full potential, to connect to our brands and to shape our workplace culture.
We believe providing for growth and retention of our employees is essential in fostering such a culture and are dedicated to providing access to training programs and career
development opportunities, including trainings on NIKE's values, history and business, trainings on developing leadership skills at all levels, tools and resources for managers and
qualified tuition reimbursement opportunities.
In empowering our employees to help shape our culture, we source employee feedback through a variety of survey tools: our annual Engagement Survey program, corporate pulse
surveys and listening sessions. These tools provide employees throughout the globe an opportunity to provide confidential feedback on key areas known to drive employee
engagement, including their satisfaction with their managers, their work and the Company generally. These tools also measure our employees' connection to NIKE's culture. NIKE also
provides multiple points of contact for employees to speak up if they experience something that does not align with our values or otherwise violates our workplace policies, even if they
are uncertain what they observed or heard is a violation of company policy.
As part of our commitment to making a positive impact on our communities, we maintain a goal of investing 2% of our prior fiscal year's pre-tax income into global communities. The
focus of this investment continues to be inspiring youth to be active through play and sport as well as uniting and inspiring communities to create a better and more equitable future for
all. Our community investments are an important part of our culture, and we support employees in giving back to community organizations through volunteering and donations, which
are matched by the NIKE Foundation where eligible.
# EMPLOYEE BASE
As of May 31, 2024, we had approximately 79,400 employees worldwide, including retail and part-time employees. We also utilize independent contractors and temporary personnel to
supplement our workforce.
Most of our employees are not represented by unions, except for certain employees in the EMEA and APLA geographies who are members of and/or represented by trade unions, as
allowed or required by local law and/or collective bargaining agreements. Also, in some countries outside of the United States, local laws require employee representation by works
councils (which may be entitled to information and consultation on certain subsidiary decisions) or by organizations similar to a union. In certain European countries, we are required
by local law to enter into, and/or comply with, industry-wide or national collective bargaining agreements. NIKE has never experienced a material interruption of operations due to
labor disagreements.
# DIVERSITY, EQUITY AND INCLUSION
Diversity, equity and inclusion ("DE&I") is a strategic priority for NIKE and we are committed to having an inclusive and diverse team and culture. We aim to foster an inclusive and
accessible workplace through recruitment, development and retention of talent from diverse experiences and backgrounds with the goal of expanding representation across all
dimensions of diversity over the long term. We remain committed to the targets announced in fiscal 2021 for the Company to work toward by fiscal 2025, including diverse
representation in our corporate workforce and leadership positions.
We continue our efforts to recruit talent through our traditional channels and through initiatives, such as partnerships with athletes and sports-related organizations to create
apprenticeship programs and new partnerships with organizations, colleges and universities that serve diverse populations. Additionally, we are prioritizing DE&I education so that all
NIKE employees and leaders have the cultural knowledge and understanding to lead inclusively and build diverse and inclusive teams. We also have Employee Networks, collectively
known as Nike UNITED, representing various employee groups.

Our DE&I focus extends beyond our workforce and includes our communities, which we support in a number of ways. We have committed to investments that aim to address racial
inequality and improve diversity and representation in our communities. We also are leveraging our global scale to support business diversity among the businesses with which we
work.
COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS
NIKE's total rewards are intended to be competitive and equitable, meet the diverse needs of our global teammates and reinforce our values. We are committed to providing
comprehensive, competitive and equitable pay and benefits to our employees, and we have invested, and aim to continue to invest, in our employees through growth and
development and holistic well-being initiatives. Our initiatives in this area include:
We are committed to competitive pay, pay equity and to reviewing our pay and promotion practices annually.
We have an annual company bonus plan and a retail-focused bonus plan applicable to all eligible employees. Both programs are focused on rewarding employees for company
performance, which we believe reinforces our culture and rewards behaviors that support collaboration and teamwork.

Investors should also be aware that while NIKE does, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against NIKE's policy to disclose to them any material non-public
information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, shareholders should not assume that NIKE agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst
irrespective of the content of the statement or report. Furthermore, NIKE has a policy against confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others. Thus, to the extent that
reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of NIKE.
## Risk Factors
The risks included here are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Annual Report may include additional factors which could adversely affect NIKE's business and financial
performance. Moreover, NIKE operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict
all such risks, nor can it assess the impact of all such risks on NIKE's business or the extent to which any risk, or combination of risks, may cause actual results to differ materially from
those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of
actual results.

# Economic and Industry Risks
**Global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.**
The uncertain state of the global economy, including sustained high levels of inflation and interest rates and the risk of a recession, continues to impact businesses around the world. If global and financial market conditions deteriorate, the following factors, among others, could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition:
*   Our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers. Declines in consumer spending have in the past resulted in and may in the future result in reduced demand for our products, increased inventories, reduced orders from retailers for our products, order cancellations, lower revenues, higher discounts and lower gross margins.
*   In the future, we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so.
*   We conduct transactions in various currencies, which creates exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. Dollar. Continued volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies has had and could continue to have a significant impact on our reported operating results and financial condition.
*   Continued volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain (such as cotton or petroleum derivatives) has had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our costs, gross margins and profitability. In addition, supply chain issues caused by factors including geopolitical conflicts and pandemics have impacted and may in the future impact the availability, pricing and timing for obtaining commodities and raw materials.
*   If retailers of our products experience declining revenues or experience difficulty obtaining financing to purchase our products, this could result in reduced orders for our products, order cancellations, late retailer payments, extended payment terms, higher accounts receivable, reduced cash flows, greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense.
*   In the past, certain retailers of our products have experienced severe financial difficulty, become insolvent and ceased business operations, and this could occur in the future, which could negatively impact the sale of our products to consumers.
*   If contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing to purchase raw materials or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital needs, it may result in delays or non-delivery of shipments of our products.

**Our products, services and experiences face intense competition.**
NIKE is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products, services and experiences. The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive both in the United States and worldwide. We compete with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies, athletic and leisure apparel companies, sports equipment companies, private label brands offered by major retailers and various other large companies that have diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear, apparel and equipment. New competitors frequently enter the markets we serve. We also compete with other companies for the production capacity of contract manufacturers that produce our products. In addition, we and our contract manufacturers compete with other companies and industries for raw materials used in our products. Our NIKE Direct operations, both through our digital commerce operations and retail stores, also compete with multi-brand retailers, which sell our products through their digital platforms and physical stores, and with digital commerce platforms. In addition, we compete with respect to the digital services and experiences we are able to offer our consumers, including fitness and activity apps; sport, fitness and wellness content and services; and digital services and features in retail stores that enhance the consumer experience.

Product offerings, product innovations and technologies, marketing expenditures (including expenditures for advertising and endorsements), pricing, costs of production, customer service, digital commerce platforms, digital services and experiences and social media presence are areas of intense competition. These, in addition to ongoing rapid changes in technology (including marketing and advertising technology), a reduction in barriers to starting new footwear and apparel companies and an increase in the number of such companies (some of which may be able to react more nimbly to changes in consumer preferences) and changes in consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear, apparel, and equipment, services and experiences, constitute significant risk factors in our operations. In addition, the competitive nature of retail, including shifts in the ways in which consumers shop, constitutes a risk factor implicating our NIKE Direct and wholesale operations. If we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors, our costs may increase, demand for our products may decline, possibly significantly, or we may need to reduce wholesale or suggested retail prices for our products.

Economic factors beyond our control, and changes in the global economic environment, including fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates, could result in
lower revenues, higher costs and decreased margins and earnings.
A majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the United States, and we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies, which creates exposure to the
volatility of global economic conditions, including fluctuations in inflation and foreign currency exchange rates. Central banks deploy various strategies to combat inflation, including
increasing interest rates, which impact our borrowing costs. Government shutdowns or the risk of government shutdowns, as well as the impact or expected impact of elections, both
in the United States and in other countries around the world, may also increase volatility. Additionally, there has been, and may continue to be, volatility in currency exchange rates
that impact the U.S. Dollar value relative to other international currencies. Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign
currencies, and these revenues and expenses are affected by currency fluctuations, specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U.S. Dollars for
consolidated financial reporting, as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar adversely affects the U.S. Dollar value of the Company's foreign currency-denominated
sales and earnings. Currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw
materials more expensive and more difficult to finance. Foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations
and financial condition.
We hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to completely eliminate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results. Since the
hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger U.S. Dollar or other trading currency, but they also reduce the positive impact
of a weaker U.S. Dollar or other trading currency. Our future financial results have in the past been and could in the future be significantly affected by the value of the U.S. Dollar in
relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging
activities.
We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our wholesale customers.
We extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer's financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. To assist in the scheduling of production and the
shipping of our products, we offer certain customers the opportunity to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program. These advance orders
may be canceled under certain conditions, and the risk of cancellation increases when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty. In the
past, some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies, which have had an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and
our financial condition. When the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts, retailers tend to be more cautious with orders. A slowing or changing economy in our key
markets, including a recession, could adversely affect the financial health of our customers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
condition. In addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers, which requires continuing
investments by retailers. Retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them, resulting in lower sales and orders for our products.
Climate change and other sustainability-related matters, or legal, regulatory or market responses thereto, may have an adverse impact on our business and results of
operations.
There are concerns that increased levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have caused, and may continue to cause, potentially at a growing rate,
increases in global temperatures, changes in weather patterns and increasingly frequent and/or prolonged extreme weather and climate events. Climate change may also exacerbate
challenges relating to the availability and quality of water and raw materials, including those used in the production of our products, and may result in changes in regulations or
consumer preferences, which could in turn affect our business, operating results and financial condition. For example, there has been increased focus by governmental and non-
governmental organizations, consumers, customers, employees and other stakeholders on products that are sustainably made and other sustainability matters, including responsible
sourcing and deforestation, the use of plastic, energy and water, the recyclability or recoverability of packaging and materials transparency, any of which may require us to incur
increased costs for additional transparency, due diligence and reporting. In addition, federal, state or local governmental authorities in various countries are implementing, have
proposed and are likely to continue to propose, legislative and regulatory initiatives to reduce or mitigate the impacts of climate change on the environment. Various countries and
regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change, which could increase the complexity of, and potential cost related to complying with, such regulations.
Any of the foregoing may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment, may impact the availability and cost of key raw materials used in the production of our
products or the demand for our products, and, in turn, may adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.
Investors, regulators and other stakeholders are also increasingly scrutinizing companies' environmental, social and governance ("ESG") commitments, performance and disclosures,
including related to climate change, and in recent years have placed increasing importance on social costs and related implications of their investments. Additionally, organizations that
provide
2024 FORM 10-K 11

# Table of Contents

information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their respective approaches to ESG matters,
which are increasingly being employed by investors, lenders, and customers to inform their investment, financing or purchasing decisions. Although we have announced sustainability-
related goals and targets, there can be no assurance that our stakeholders will agree with our strategies, and any perception, whether or not valid, that we have failed to achieve, or to
act responsibly with respect to, such matters or to effectively respond to new or additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate change, could result in adverse publicity
and adversely affect our business and reputation. Execution of these strategies and achievement of our goals is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our
control. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, our ability to execute our strategies and achieve our goals within the currently projected costs and the expected
timeframes; the availability and cost of raw materials and renewable energy; unforeseen production, design, operational and technological difficulties; the outcome of research efforts
and future technology developments, including the ability to scale projects and technologies on a commercially competitive basis such as carbon sequestration and/or other related
processes; compliance with, and changes or additions to, global and regional regulations, taxes, charges, mandates or requirements relating to greenhouse gas emissions, carbon
costs or climate-related goals; adapting products to customer preferences and customer acceptance of sustainable supply chain solutions; and the actions of competitors and
competitive pressures. As a result, there is no assurance that we will be able to adequately meet stakeholder expectations, successfully execute our strategies or achieve our
sustainability-related goals, which could damage our reputation and customer and other stakeholder relationships and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations
and financial condition.

**Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.**

Given the broad and global scope of our operations, we are particularly vulnerable to the physical risks of climate change, such as shifts in weather patterns. Extreme weather
conditions in the areas in which our retail stores, suppliers, manufacturers, customers, distribution centers, offices, headquarters and vendors are located could adversely affect our
operating results and financial condition. Moreover, natural disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, tsunamis, floods or droughts, whether occurring in the United States
or abroad, and their related consequences and effects, including energy shortages and public health issues, have in the past temporarily disrupted, and could in the future disrupt, our
operations, the operations of our vendors, manufacturers and other suppliers or have in the past resulted in, and in the future could result in, economic instability that may negatively
impact our operating results and financial condition. In particular, if a natural disaster or severe weather event were to occur in an area in which we or our suppliers, manufacturers,
employees, customers, distribution centers or vendors are located, our continued success would depend, in part, on the safety and availability of the relevant personnel and facilities
and proper functioning of our or third parties' computer, network, telecommunication and other systems and operations. In addition, a natural disaster or severe weather event could
negatively impact retail traffic to our stores or stores that carry our products and could have an adverse impact on consumer spending, any of which could in turn result in negative
point-of-sale trends for our merchandise. Further, climate change may increase both the frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions and natural disasters, which may affect
our business operations, either in a particular region or globally, as well as the activities of our third-party vendors and other suppliers, manufacturers and customers. The diversity of
locations in which we operate, our operational size, disaster recovery and business continuity planning and our information technology systems and networks, including the Internet
and third-party services ("Information Technology Systems"), may not be sufficient for all or for concurrent eventualities. If we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other
business continuity event or concurrent events, we could experience operational challenges, in particular depending upon how a local or regional event may affect our human capital
across our operations or with regard to particular aspects of our operations, such as key executive officers or personnel. For example, our World Headquarters is located in a seismic
zone, which is at a higher risk for earthquakes and the related consequences or effects. Further, if we are unable to find alternative suppliers, replace capacity at key manufacturing or
distribution locations or quickly repair damage to our Information Technology Systems or supply systems, we could be late in delivering, or be unable to deliver, products to our
customers. These events could result in reputational damage, lost sales, cancellation charges or markdowns, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

**Our financial condition and results of operations have been, and could in the future be, adversely affected by a pandemic, epidemic or other public health emergency.**

Pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and other public health emergencies, and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate such crises have caused, and may in the
future cause, business slowdown or shutdown in affected areas and significant disruption in the financial markets, both globally and in the United States. These events have led to and
could again lead to adverse impacts to our global supply chain, factory cancellation costs, store closures, and a decline in retail traffic and discretionary spending by consumers and, in
turn, materially impact our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations as well as cause a volatile effective tax rate driven by changes in the mix of earnings across our
jurisdictions. We cannot predict whether, and to what degree, our sales, operations and financial results could in the future be affected by the pandemic and preventative measures.
Risks presented by pandemics and other public health emergencies include, but are not limited to:

*   Deterioration in economic conditions in the United States and globally, including the effect of prolonged periods of inflation on our consumers and vendors;

2024 FORM 10-K 12

# Page 16 of 103

Table of Contents

*   Disruption to our distribution centers, contract manufacturers, finished goods factories and other vendors, through the effects of facility closures, increased operating costs, reductions in operating hours, labor shortages, and real time changes in operating procedures, such as additional cleaning and disinfection procedures, which have had, and could in the future again have, a significant impact on our planned inventory production and distribution, including higher inventory levels or inventory shortages in various markets;
*   Impacts to our distribution and logistics providers' ability to operate, including labor and container shortages, and increases in their operating costs. These supply chain effects have had, and could in the future have, an adverse effect on our ability to meet consumer demand, including digital demand, and have in the past resulted in and could in the future result in extended inventory transit times and an increase in our costs of production and distribution, including increased freight and logistics costs and other expenses;
*   Decreased retail traffic as a result of store closures, reduced operating hours, social distancing restrictions and/or changes in consumer behavior;
*   Reduced consumer demand for our products, including as a result of a rise in unemployment rates, higher costs of borrowing, inflation and diminished consumer confidence;
*   Cancellation or postponement of sports seasons and sporting events in multiple countries, and bans on large public gatherings, which have reduced and in the future could reduce consumer spending on our products and could impact the effectiveness of our arrangements with key endorsers;
*   The risk that any safety protocols in NIKE-owned or affiliated facilities, including our offices, will not be effective or not be perceived as effective, or that any virus-related illnesses will be linked or alleged to be linked to such facilities, whether accurate or not;
*   Incremental costs resulting from the adoption of preventative measures and compliance with regulatory requirements, including providing facial coverings and hand sanitizer, rearranging operations to follow social distancing protocols, conducting temperature checks, testing and undertaking regular and thorough disinfecting of surfaces;
*   Bankruptcies or other financial difficulties facing our wholesale customers, which could cause them to be unable to make or delay making payments to us, or result in revised payment terms, cancellation or reduction of their orders; and
*   Significant disruption of and volatility in global financial markets, which could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital in the future.

We cannot reasonably predict the ultimate impact of any pandemic or public health emergency, including the extent of any adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition, which will depend on, among other things, the duration and spread of the pandemic or public health emergency, the impact of governmental regulations that have been, and may continue to be, imposed in response, the effectiveness of actions taken to contain or mitigate the outbreak, the availability, safety and efficacy of vaccines, including against emerging variants of the infectious disease, and global economic conditions. Additionally, disruptions have in the past made it more challenging to compare our performance, including our revenue growth and overall profitability, across quarters and fiscal years, and could have this effect in the future. Any pandemic or public health emergency may also affect our business, results of operations or financial condition in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks and may also exacerbate, or occur concurrently with, other risks discussed in this Item 1A. Risk Factors, any of which could have a material effect on us.

**Business and Operational Risks**

Failure to maintain our reputation, brand image and culture could negatively impact our business.

Our iconic brands have worldwide recognition, and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation. Maintaining, promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts, including product innovation, product quality and advertising and consumer campaigns. Our commitment to product innovation, quality and sustainability, and our continuing investment in design (including materials), marketing and sustainability measures may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation. In addition, our success in maintaining, extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media and digital environment, including our reliance on social media, digital advertising networks, digital and advertising technology, and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns on our digital platforms and through our digital experiences and products. We could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives.

Our brand value also depends on our ability to maintain a positive consumer perception of our corporate integrity, purpose and brand culture. Negative claims or publicity involving us, our culture and values, our products, services and experiences, consumer data, or any of our key employees, endorsers, sponsors, suppliers or partners could seriously damage our reputation and brand image, regardless of whether such claims are accurate. For example, while we require our suppliers of our products to operate their business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we do not control their practices. Negative publicity

2024 FORM 10-K 13

# Page 17 of 103

Table of Contents

relating to a violation or an alleged violation of policies or laws by such suppliers could damage our brand image and diminish consumer trust in our brand. Further, our reputation and
brand image could be damaged as a result of our support of, association with or lack of support or disapproval of certain social causes and public personalities, as well as any
decisions we make to continue to conduct, or change, certain of our activities in response to such considerations. Social media, which accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope
of negative publicity, can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims. Adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us, or by us, could also damage our
reputation and brand image, undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce long-term demand for our products, even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to
our operations. If the reputation, culture or image of any of our brands is tarnished or if we receive negative publicity, then our sales, financial condition and results of operations could
be materially and adversely affected.
If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits.
Our success depends on our ability to identify, originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate, gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner so that
our product offerings evolve and are responsive to consumer demands. However, lead times for many of our products make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or
changing product trends or consumer preferences. All of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. Our new products may
not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of products or away from these types of products altogether, and our future success
depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. If we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the
mix of existing product offerings, developing new products, designs, styles and categories, and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing, we could
experience lower sales, excess inventories or lower profit margins, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we
market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns, including social media and other digital advertising networks. If we
do not successfully market our products, if advertising and promotional costs increase or if certain advertising networks are no longer available, these factors could have an adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We rely on technical innovation and high-quality products to compete.
Technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing processes of footwear, apparel, equipment and other products and services are essential to the commercial
success of our products and development of new products. Research and development play a key role in technical innovation. We rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics,
chemistry, exercise physiology, engineering, digital technologies, industrial design, sustainability and related fields, as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of
athletes, coaches, trainers, equipment managers, orthopedists, podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cutting-edge performance products. While we strive to produce
products that help to enhance athletic performance and reduce injury and maximize comfort, if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products, consumer demand for our
products could decline, and if we experience problems with the quality of our products (including the introduction of bias or inaccuracies in our products), we may incur substantial
expense to remedy the problems and loss of consumer confidence.
Our enterprise initiative may not generate the intended benefits or projected cost savings we anticipate.
In December 2023, we announced a multi-year enterprise initiative aimed at delivering cost savings and investing in future growth, accelerating innovation and driving profitability.
Areas of potential savings include simplifying our product assortment, increasing automation and use of technology, streamlining our organization and leveraging our scale to drive
greater efficiency. Our ability to achieve the intended cost savings and goals associated with the enterprise initiative are subject to many estimates and assumptions, which may
change during implementation and execution. For example, we may not be able to identify opportunities to deliver anticipated cost savings. Additionally, the timing of the cost savings
associated with the enterprise initiative may be delayed. Further, we may also face disruptions to our business or operations as we execute on the initiative.
Our business is affected by seasonality, which could result in fluctuations in our operating results.
We experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year. Historically, revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second
and third fiscal quarters. However, the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time or in the future as a result of strategic shifts in our business and seasonal or
geographic demand for particular types of footwear, apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing of significant sporting events, such as the NBA Finals, Olympics or the
World Cup, among others. In addition, our customers may, and from time to time do, cancel orders, change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal
notice. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales. Accordingly, our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period. This
seasonality, along with other factors that are beyond our control, including economic conditions, changes in consumer preferences, weather conditions, outbreaks of disease, social or
political unrest, availability of import quotas, transportation disruptions and currency exchange rate fluctuations, has in the past adversely affected and could in the future adversely
affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate. Our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control, including
manufacturing and transportation costs, shifts in product sales

mix and geographic sales trends, all of which we expect to continue. Results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future
period.
Failure to continue to obtain or maintain high-quality endorsers of our products could harm our business.
We establish relationships with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues, as well as other public figures, including artists, designers and influencers, to develop, evaluate and
promote our products, as well as establish product authenticity with consumers. However, as competition in our industry has increased, the costs associated with establishing and
retaining such sponsorships and other relationships have increased, and competition to attract and retain high-quality endorsers has increased. If we are unable to negotiate new, or
maintain our current, associations with professional athletes, sports teams and leagues, or other public figures, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the high visibility or on-
field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. As a result, our brands, net revenues,
expenses and profitability could be harmed.
Furthermore, if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, actions taken or
statements made by athletes, teams or leagues, or other endorsers, associated with our products or brand that harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues, or
endorsers, or our decisions to cease collaborating with certain endorsers in light of actions taken or statements made by them, have in the past harmed and could in the future
seriously harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. Poor or non-performance by our endorsers, a
failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes, public figures or sports organizations, to use and endorse our products and brand or a failure to enter into cost-effective
endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes, public figures and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand, sales and profitability.
Failure to accurately forecast consumer demand could lead to excess inventories or inventory shortages, which could result in decreased operating margins, reduced
cash flows and harm to our business.
To meet anticipated demand for our products, we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders, which we hold in
inventory and resell to customers. There is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in
inventory write-downs, and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results, financial
condition and cash flows. Conversely, if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them, we
may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages could delay shipments to customers, negatively impact retailer, distributor and consumer relationships and diminish brand
loyalty. The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations, financial condition and cash flows from period to period. A failure to
accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income, and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in
advance.
Our NIKE Direct operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and
uncertainties.
Our NIKE Direct operations, including our retail stores and digital platforms, have required and will continue to require significant investment. Our NIKE Direct stores have required and
will continue to require substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements and personnel. We have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail
space. Certain stores have been designed and built to serve as high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities and to integrate with our digital platforms.
Because of their unique design and technological elements, locations and size, these stores require substantially more investment than other stores. Due to the high fixed-cost
structure associated with our NIKE Direct retail stores, a decline in sales, a shift in consumer behavior away from brick-and-mortar retail, or the closure, temporary or otherwise, or
poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employee-related costs.
Many factors unique to retail operations, some of which are beyond our control, pose risks and uncertainties. Risks include, but are not limited to: credit card fraud and theft in both our
retail stores and on digital platforms; mismanagement of existing retail channel partners; inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation; and supply chain
and inventory management.
In addition, we have made significant investments in digital technologies and information systems for the digital aspect of our NIKE Direct operations, and our digital offerings will
require continued investment in the development and upgrading of our technology platforms. In order to deliver high-quality digital experiences, our digital platforms must be designed
effectively and work well with a range of other technologies, systems, networks, and standards that we do not control. We may not be successful in developing platforms that operate
effectively with these technologies, systems, networks or standards. A growing portion of consumers access our NIKE Direct digital platforms, but in the event that it is more difficult
for consumers to access and use our digital platforms, consumers find that our digital platforms do not effectively meet their needs or expectations or consumers choose not to access
or use our digital platforms or use devices that do not offer access to our platforms, the success of our
2024 FORM 10-K 15

# Table of Contents
NIKE Direct operations could be adversely impacted. Our competitors may develop, or have already developed, digital experiences, features, content, services or technologies that
are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance.
We may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment in our NIKE Direct operations and management's attention from our other business opportunities could be diverted, which
could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
**If the technology-based systems, applications and platforms that give our consumers the ability to shop or interact with us online do not function effectively, our
operating results, as well as our ability to grow our digital commerce business globally or to retain our customer base, could be materially adversely affected.**
Many of our consumers shop with us through our digital platforms. Consumers frequently use mobile-based devices and applications to shop online with us and with our competitors,
and to do comparison shopping, as well as to engage with us and our competitors through digital services and experiences that are offered on mobile platforms. We use social media
and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our consumers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, effective,
reliable, secure and user-friendly digital commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing
expectations of online shoppers or any failure to provide attractive digital experiences to our customers could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of digital
commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with consumers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our digital commerce business globally and have a material adverse
impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, as use of our digital platforms continues to grow, we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure to continue
to satisfy our consumers' needs. If we fail to continue to effectively scale and adapt our digital platforms to accommodate increased consumer demand, our business may be subject to
interruptions, delays or failures and consumer demand for our products and digital experiences could decline.
Risks specific to our digital commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers' brick and mortar stores, pricing pressure on our products, difficulty in
recreating the in-store experience through direct channels and liability for online content. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our digital
commerce business, as well as damage our reputation and brands.
**We rely significantly on information technology to operate our business, including our supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy or interruption of
that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.**
We are heavily dependent on Information Technology Systems, across our supply chain, including product design, production, forecasting, ordering, manufacturing, transportation,
sales and distribution, as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes, retail operations and other business activities. Information Technology
Systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown. For example, our ability
to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these Information Technology Systems.
Over a number of years, we have implemented Information Technology Systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate. Our work to integrate, secure and enhance
these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing and NIKE will continue to invest in these efforts. We cannot provide assurance, however, that the measures
we take to secure and enhance these systems will be sufficient to protect our Information Technology Systems and prevent cyber-attacks, system failures or data or information loss.
The failure of these systems to operate effectively, including as a result of security breaches, viruses, hackers, malware, ransomware, denial of service attacks, natural disasters,
vendor business interruptions or other causes, failure to properly maintain, protect, repair or upgrade systems, or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems
could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, could require significant time and capital investments to remediate the problem which may not be
sufficient to cover all eventualities, and may have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the use of employee-owned devices for
communications as well as hybrid work arrangements, present additional operational risks to our Information Technology Systems, including, but not limited to, increased risks of
cyber-attacks. Further, like other companies in the retail industry, we have in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, cyber-attacks, including phishing, and
other attempts to breach, or gain unauthorized access to, our systems. To date, these attacks have not had a material impact on our operations, but we cannot provide assurance that
they will not have an impact in the future.
We also use Information Technology Systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting,
legal and tax requirements. From time to time, we have expended, and expect to continue to expend, significant resources to modify, update and enhance our Information Technology
Systems and to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures. These modifications, updates and enhancements may cost more than initially expected and may not be
effective in preventing issues and disruptions. Moreover, due to the complexity of our Information Technology Systems, the process of implementing modifications or enhancements
can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues. If Information Technology Systems suffer severe damage, disruption or shutdown and our
2024 FORM 10-K 16

# Table of Contents

business continuity plans, or those of our vendors, do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, we could experience delays in reporting our financial results, which could
result in lost revenues and profits, as well as reputational damage.

Furthermore, we depend on Information Technology Systems and personal data collection for digital marketing, digital commerce, consumer engagement and the marketing and use of
our digital products and services. We also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other
third parties, including customers, suppliers, vendors and consumers. Any interruption in Information Technology Systems may impede our ability to engage in the digital space and
result in lost revenues, damage to our reputation, and loss of users.

Given the increasing complexity and sophistication of techniques used by bad actors to obtain unauthorized access to or disable information technology systems, and the fact that
cyber-attacks are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives, it is increasingly difficult to anticipate and defend against cyber-attacks, and a
cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected. Moreover, the extent of a particular cyber incident and the steps that we may need to take to
investigate the incident may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such investigation can be finalized and completed and reliable information
about the incident is known. During the pendency of any such investigation, we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it and we may be required to
disclose incidents before their full extent is known.

Moreover, to the extent we integrate artificial intelligence ("Al") into our operations, this may increase the cybersecurity and privacy risks, including the risk of unauthorized or misuse
of Al tools, we are exposed to, and threat actors may leverage Al to engage in automated, targeted and coordinated attacks of our systems.

**We are subject to the risk our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands.**
We currently license, and expect to continue licensing, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. If our licensees fail to successfully
market and sell licensed products, or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations, customer relationships, labor relationships, supplier relationships
or credit risks, it could adversely affect our revenues, both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products.

We also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands. Although we attempt to protect our brands through approval rights over the design, production processes,
quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our licensed products, we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brands by our licensees. The
misuse of a brand by or negative publicity involving a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on us.

**Consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell
products.**
The athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear, apparel and equipment retailers with many stores and
accelerating digital commerce capabilities. The market shares of these retailers may increase through acquisitions and construction of additional stores and investments in digital
capacity, and as a result of attrition as struggling retailers exit the market. Consolidation of our retailers will concentrate our credit risk with a smaller set of retailers, any of whom may
experience declining sales or a shortage of liquidity. In addition, increasing market share concentration among a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if
any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products, we may be unable to find sufficient retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and
revenues.

**If one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail, we may incur significant losses.**
As part of our hedging activities, we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments, which may include forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, option
contracts, collars and swaps with various financial institutions. In addition, we have significant amounts of cash, cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with
banks or other financial institutions in the United States and abroad. As a result, we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions. The risk of
counterparty default or failure may be heightened during periods of sustained high interest rates and uncertainty in the financial markets as well as economic downturns. If one of our
counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default, or our assets deposited or held in accounts with such
counterparty, may be limited by the counterparty's liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of default or failure of one or more
of our counterparties, we could incur significant losses, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.

**We rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products.**
We rely upon a concentrated amount of contract manufacturers, which we do not own or operate, to manufacture all of the footwear products we sell, see "Manufacturing" for additional
information. Our ability to meet our customers' needs depends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our contract manufacturers. If one or more of our significant
suppliers

were to sever their relationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship, including due to changes in applicable trade policies, or be unable to perform, we may not be
able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, sales, financial condition or results of operations.
Additionally, if any of our primary footwear contract manufacturers fail to make timely shipments, do not meet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance
with our plans, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Certain of our footwear contract manufacturers are highly specialized and only produce a specific type of product. Such contract manufacturers may go out of business if consumer
preferences or market conditions change such that there is no longer sufficient demand for the types of products they produce. If, in the future, the relevant products are again in
demand and the specialized contract manufacturers no longer exist, we may not be able to locate replacement facilities to manufacture certain footwear products in a timely manner or
at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our sales, financial condition or results of operations.
The market for prime real estate is competitive.
Our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations, both domestically and internationally, depends on the availability of real
estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing real
estate leases. In addition, from time to time, we seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition or close some of our real estate locations, which may require modification of an existing
lease. Failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations, or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores,
could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.
Additionally, the economic environment may make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally. This could impact the quality of
our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could
impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, which could have an adverse effect on
our operating results and financial condition.
The success of our business depends, in part, on high-quality employees, including key personnel as well as our ability to maintain our workplace culture and values.
Our success depends in part on the continued service of high-quality employees, including key executive officers and personnel. The loss of the services of key individuals, or any
negative perception with respect to these individuals, or our workplace culture or values, could harm our business. Our success also depends on our ability to recruit, retain and
engage our personnel sufficiently, both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives. Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not
be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. Changes to our current and future work models may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees or may not be
perceived as favorable compared to other companies' policies, which could negatively impact our ability to attract, hire and retain our employees. In addition, shifts in U.S. immigration
policy could negatively impact our ability to attract, hire and retain highly skilled employees who are from outside the United States. We also believe that our corporate culture has been
a key driver of our success, and we have invested substantial time and resources in building, maintaining and evolving our culture. Any failure to preserve and evolve our culture could
negatively affect our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit employees.
Our business operations and financial performance could be adversely affected by changes in our relationship with our workforce or changes to United States or foreign
employment regulations.
We have significant exposure to changes in domestic and foreign laws governing our relationships with our workforce, including wage and hour laws and regulations, fair labor
standards, minimum wage requirements, overtime pay, unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation rates, citizenship requirements and payroll taxes, which could have a direct
impact on our operating costs. A significant increase in minimum wage or overtime rates in countries where we have workforce could have a significant impact on our operating costs
and may require that we relocate those operations or take other steps to mitigate such increases, all of which may cause us to incur additional costs. There is also a risk of potential
claims that we have violated laws related to discrimination and harassment, health and safety, wage and hour laws, criminal activity, personal injury and other claims. In addition, if
there were a significant increase in the number of members of our workforce who are members of labor organizations or become parties to collective bargaining agreements, we could
be vulnerable to a strike, work stoppage or other labor action, as well as additional expenses, expectations or requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our business.
Risks Related to Operating a Global Business
Our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business.
Nearly all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the United States, and the majority of our products are sold outside of the United States. Accordingly, we are
subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad, which include foreign laws and regulations, varying consumer preferences across geographic
regions, political tensions, unrest, disruptions or delays in cross-border shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our
2024 FORM 10-K 18

# Page 22 of 103

Table of Contents
products are manufactured or where we sell products. Changes in U.S. or international social, political, regulatory and economic conditions could impact our business, reputation,
financial condition and results of operations. In particular, political and economic instability, geopolitical conflicts, political unrest, civil strife, terrorist activity, acts of war, public
corruption, expropriation, nationalism and other economic or political uncertainties in the United States or internationally could interrupt and negatively affect the sale of our products or
other business operations. Any negative sentiment toward the United States as a result of any such changes could also adversely affect our business.
In addition, terrorist acts, military conflict and disease outbreaks have increased the risks of doing business abroad. These factors, among others, could affect our ability to
manufacture products or procure materials, or our costs for manufacturing and procuring materials, our ability to import products, our ability to sell products in international markets
and our cost of doing business. If any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical, our business could be adversely
affected.
Our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing, manufacturing and financing.
The principal materials used in our footwear products natural and synthetic rubber, plastic compounds, foam cushioning materials, natural and synthetic leather, nylon, polyester
and natural fiber textiles and polyurethane films are locally available to manufacturers. The principal materials used in our apparel products natural and synthetic fabrics, yarns
and threads (both virgin and recycled), specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body, retain heat and repel rain and/or snow as well as
plastic and metal hardware are also available in countries where our manufacturing takes place. Both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our
contract manufacturers to locate, train, employ and retain adequate personnel. NIKE contract manufacturers and materials suppliers buy raw materials and are subject to wage rates
and other labor standards that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the countries in which our products are manufactured.
There could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption or heightened competition for such materials, our
contract manufacturers might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all. Further, our contract manufacturers have
experienced and may continue to experience in the future, unexpected closures, unexpected increases in work wages or other changes in labor standards, whether government
mandated or otherwise, and increases in compliance costs due to governmental regulation concerning certain metals, fabrics or raw materials used in the manufacturing of our
products. In addition, we cannot be certain that manufacturers that we do not contract and that we refer to as "unaffiliated manufacturers" will be able to fill our orders in a timely
manner. If we experience significant increases in demand, or reductions in the availability of materials, or need to replace an existing contract manufacturer or materials supplier, there
can be no assurance additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or that any
contract manufacturer, unaffiliated manufacturer, or any materials supplier would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. Even if we are able to expand
existing or find new manufacturing capacity or sources of materials, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and
manufacturers in our methods, products, quality control standards and labor, health and safety standards. In addition, changes we make in managing the supply of our products, such
as changes to decrease the supply of certain products, pose the risk that we may not be able to meet demand for, or ramp up production of, certain products timely or without
additional cost. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in labor or wages, in the supply of materials or in the manufacturing of our products could have an adverse effect on our
ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short- and long-term.
Because contract manufacturers make a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets, our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic
distances. Delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, container shortages, labor shortages, including work stoppages or port strikes,
infrastructure and port congestion or other factors, and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers, have adversely impacted, and could in
the future adversely impact the availability of our products and, in turn, our financial performance. In addition, delays in the shipment or delivery of our products, manufacturing delays
or unexpected demand for our products have required us, and may in the future require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as air freight, which could
adversely affect our profit margins. The cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely
affect our profit margins. Changes in U.S. trade policies, including modifications to import tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements, have also had, and could continue to have
a significant impact on our activities in foreign jurisdictions, and could adversely affect our reputation or results of operations.
In addition, we have become, and expect to continue to be, subject to a number of regulations that require us to develop new policies and procedures for, strive to mitigate, and report,
certain supply chain risks related to sourcing internationally. These regulations have resulted and may continue to result in increased operating costs and affect how and where we
source materials for our products.

Our success depends on our global distribution facilities.
We distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world. Our ability to meet customer expectations, manage
inventory, complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth, particularly in emerging markets, depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities,
the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties (including those involved in shipping product to and from our
distribution facilities). Our distribution facilities have in the past and could in the future be interrupted by information technology problems, disasters such as earthquakes or fires or
outbreaks of disease or government actions taken to mitigate their spread. Any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business. We
maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities.
Legal, Regulatory, and Compliance Risks
We are subject to a complex array of laws and regulations and litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings, which could have an adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.
As a multinational corporation with operations and distribution channels throughout the world, we are subject to and must comply with extensive laws and regulations in the United
States and other jurisdictions in which we have operations and distribution channels. If we or our employees, agents, suppliers, and other partners fail to comply with any of these laws
or regulations, such failure could subject us to fines, sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.
Furthermore, laws, regulations and policies and the interpretation of such, can conflict among jurisdictions and compliance in one jurisdiction may result in legal or reputational risks in
another jurisdiction. We are involved in various types of claims, lawsuits, regulatory proceedings and government investigations relating to our business, our products and the actions
of our employees and representatives, including contractual and employment relationships, product liability, antitrust, trademark rights and a variety of other matters. It is not possible
to predict with certainty the outcome of any such legal or regulatory proceedings or investigations, and we could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties, or enter into
settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and negatively impact our reputation. The
global nature of our business means legal and compliance risks, such as anti-bribery, anti-corruption, fraud, trade, environmental, competition, privacy and other regulatory matters,
will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies have and will continue to arise from time to time, which could adversely affect us. In addition, the
adoption of new laws or regulations, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations, may result in significant unanticipated legal and reputational risks. Moreover, the
regulation of certain transactions we engage in, including those involving virtual goods and cryptocurrencies, remains in an early stage and subject to significant uncertainty. As a
result, we are required to exercise our judgment as to whether or how certain laws or regulations apply, or may in the future apply, and it is possible that legislators, regulators and
courts may disagree with our conclusions. Any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings could divert management's attention from our operations and result in substantial legal
fees.
Changes to U.S. or other countries' trade policies and tariff and import/export regulations or our failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse
effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.
Changes in the U.S. government's import and export policies, including trade restrictions, sanctions and countersanctions, increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards or
customs restrictions, could require us to change the way we conduct business and adversely affect our results of operations.
In addition, changes in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or
conduct our business could adversely affect our business. U.S. presidential administrations have instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or
termination of trade agreements, the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the U.S., economic sanctions on individuals, corporations or countries, and other government
regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries where we conduct our business. It may be time-consuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in
order to adapt to or comply with any such changes.
Changes or proposed changes in U.S. or other countries' trade policies may result in restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade. Tariffs and other changes in U.S.
trade policy have in the past and could in the future trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing
retaliatory measures on certain U.S. goods. Further, any emerging protectionist or nationalist trends either in the United States or in other countries could affect the trade environment.
The Company, similar to many other multinational corporations, does a significant amount of business that would be impacted by changes to the trade policies of the United States
and foreign countries (including governmental action related to tariffs, international trade agreements, or economic sanctions). Such changes have the potential to adversely impact
the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof or the economy of another country in which we conduct operations, our industry and the global demand for our products, and as a result,
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
In addition, many of our imported products are subject to duties, tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the United States and other
countries. Any country in which our products are produced or sold may
2024 FORM 10-K 20

# Page 24 of 103

Table of Contents
eliminate, adjust or impose new quotas, duties, tariffs, safeguard measures, anti-dumping duties, cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism, restrictions on the transfer of currency, climate
change legislation, product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Furthermore, we are subject to the FCPA as well as the anti-corruption laws of other countries in which we operate. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to
promote compliance with these laws, our employees, independent contractors, contract manufacturers, suppliers and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource
certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation could result in sanctions or other penalties and have an adverse effect on our
business, reputation and operating results.
**Failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.**
We periodically discover counterfeit reproductions of our products or products that otherwise infringe our intellectual property rights. If we are unsuccessful in enforcing our intellectual
property rights, continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and could result in a shift of consumer preference away from our products.
The actions we take to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others. We also may be unable to prevent
others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights.
We may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim we infringe their intellectual property rights. Defending infringement claims could be expensive and time-consuming and
might result in our entering into costly license agreements. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, manufacturing, use, importation and/or
sale of certain products.
We take various actions to prevent the unauthorized use and/or disclosure of our confidential information and intellectual property rights. These actions include contractual measures
such as entering into non-disclosure and non-compete agreements and agreements relating to our collaborations with third parties and providing confidential information awareness
training. Our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use and/or disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property rights might not always be effective. For example,
confidential information related to business strategy, innovations, new technologies, mergers and acquisitions, unpublished financial results or personal data could be prematurely,
inadvertently, or improperly used and/or disclosed, resulting in a loss of reputation, loss of intellectual property rights, a decline in our stock price and/or a negative impact on our
market position, and could lead to damages, fines, penalties or injunctions. In addition, new products we offer, such as virtual goods, may raise various novel intellectual property law
considerations, including adequacy and scope of assignment, licensing, transfer, copyright and other right-of-use issues.
In addition, the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. We may face
significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights, including outside the United States, and if we are unable to successfully protect our
rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others, our business or financial condition may be adversely affected.
Regulations and best practices with respect to new technological developments, including generative Al, are in the process of being developed globally. These developments may
affect aspects of our business that leverage these tools, and give rise to risks related to intellectual property infringement claims or harm to our reputation or brand image.
**We are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results, operations or reputation.**
In addition to our own sensitive and proprietary business information, we handle transactional and personal information about our wholesale customers and consumers and users of
our digital experiences, which include online distribution channels and product engagement, adaptive products and personal fitness applications. Hackers and data thieves are
increasingly sophisticated and operate social engineering, such as phishing, and large-scale, complex automated attacks that can evade detection for long periods of time. Any breach
of our or our service providers' networks, or other vendor systems, may result in the loss of confidential business and financial data, misappropriation of our consumers', users' or
employees' personal information or a disruption of our business. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, including unwanted media attention,
impairment of our consumer and customer relationships, damage to our reputation; resulting in lost sales and consumers, fines, lawsuits, or significant legal and remediation
expenses. We also may need to expend significant resources to protect against, respond to and/or redress problems caused by any breach.
In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous, and sometimes conflicting, regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the United
States, Europe and elsewhere. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR"); the United Kingdom enacted the UK General Data
Protection Regulation (which implements the GDPR into UK law); several states in the United States have passed data privacy laws; China enacted the Data Security Law and
Personal Information Protection Law; and additional jurisdictions have adopted or are considering proposing or adopting similar regulations. These laws impose additional obligations
on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provide certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored. Compliance with existing, proposed and recently
enacted laws and regulations is costly and time consuming, and any failure to comply with these regulatory
2024 FORM 10-K 21

standards could subject us to legal, operational and reputational risks. Misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and
regulations, proceedings against the Company by governmental entities or others, imposition of fines by governmental authorities and damage to our reputation and credibility and
could have a negative impact on revenues and profits.
We could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws or regulations, or changes in the interpretations thereof, additional tax liabilities or increased
volatility in our effective tax rate.
We earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and, as such, we are subject to the tax laws in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Current economic
and political conditions make tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, in any jurisdiction subject to significant change.
Proposals to reform U.S. and foreign tax laws could significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on global earnings and could increase the U.S. corporate tax
rate. For example, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (the "OECD") and the G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (the "Inclusive
Framework") has put forth two proposals-Pillar One and Pillar Two-that revise the existing profit allocation and nexus rules and ensure a minimal level of taxation, respectively.
Several countries in which we operate, including several European Union member states' have adopted domestic legislation to implement the Inclusive Framework's global corporate
minimum tax rate of 15% which will be effective beginning fiscal 2025. Other countries are also actively considering changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the Inclusive
Framework's proposals. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals, or any other changes in the U.S. or foreign tax laws or regulations, will be enacted into
law, these changes, if enacted into law, could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate, income tax expense and cash flows.
Portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are under a tax holiday. We also utilize tax rulings and other agreements to obtain certainty in treatment of certain tax
matters. Tax holidays and rulings can expire from time to time and may be extended when certain conditions are met, or terminated if certain conditions are not met. The impact of any
changes in conditions would be the loss of certainty in treatment thus potentially impacting our effective income tax rate. For example, in January 2019, the European Commission
opened a formal investigation to examine whether the Netherlands has breached State Aid rules when granting certain tax rulings to the Company. If this matter is adversely resolved,
the Netherlands may be required to assess additional amounts with respect to prior periods, and the Company's income taxes related to prior periods in the Netherlands could
increase.
We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an
adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax provisions are adequate, the final
determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of audits or related disputes could
have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made. For example, we and our subsidiaries are also
engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions. Although we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions and the proper
local transfer pricing documentation is in place, tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with
differing statutory tax rates.
Failure of our contractors or our licensees' contractors to comply with our code of conduct, local laws and other standards could harm our business.
We have license agreements that permit independent parties to manufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our intellectual property. We require the contractors that
directly manufacture our products and our licensees that make products using our intellectual property (including, indirectly, their contract manufacturers) to comply with a code of
conduct and other environmental, human rights, health and safety standards for the benefit of workers. We also require our contract manufacturers and the contractors of our licensees
to comply with applicable standards for product safety. Notwithstanding their contractual obligations, from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable
local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors. If one or more of our direct or indirect contractors violates or fails to comply
with, or is accused of violating or failing to comply with, such standards and laws, this could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and, as a result, could have an adverse
effect on our sales and financial condition. Negative publicity regarding production methods, alleged unethical or illegal practices or workplace or related conditions of any of our
suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our brand image and sales, force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturers or licenses or result in the imposition of
additional regulations, including new or additional quotas, tariffs, sanctions, product safety regulations or other regulatory measures, by governmental authorities.

# Risks Related to Our Securities, Investments and Liquidity

## Our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns.
From time to time, we may invest in product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses, such as our NIKE Direct operations, technology, business infrastructure, new businesses or capabilities, which require substantial cash investments and management attention. We believe cost-effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability; however, significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business. The failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations. See also "Our NIKE Direct operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties."

## The sale of a large number of shares of common stock by our principal shareholder could depress the market price of our common stock.
As of June 28, 2024, Swoosh, LLC beneficially owned approximately 77% of our Class A Common Stock. If, on June 28, 2024, all of these shares were converted into Class B Common Stock, Swoosh, LLC's commensurate ownership percentage of our Class B Common Stock would be approximately 16%. The shares are available for resale, subject to the requirements of the U.S. securities laws and the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing Swoosh, LLC. The sale or prospect of a sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Swoosh, LLC was formed by Philip H. Knight, our Chairman Emeritus, to hold the majority of his shares of Class A Common Stock. Mr. Knight does not have voting rights with respect to Swoosh, LLC, although Travis Knight, his son and a NIKE director, has a significant role in the management of the Class A Common Stock owned by Swoosh, LLC.

## Changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity, increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options.
Our long-term debt is currently rated Investment Grade by Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service. If our credit ratings are lowered, borrowing costs for our existing facilities or for future long-term debt or short-term credit facilities may increase and our financing options, including our access to credit or capital markets, could be adversely affected. We may also be subject to restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, make restricted payments, pledge assets as security, make investments, loans, advances, guarantees and acquisitions, undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates. Failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default, and as a result, the commitments of our lenders under our credit agreements may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated. In addition, macroeconomic conditions, such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit or capital markets, could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt.

## If our internal controls are ineffective, our operating results could be adversely affected.
Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.

## If our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting estimates prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely affected.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations". The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to sales-related reserves, inventory reserves, hedge accounting for derivatives, income taxes and other contingencies. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the price of our Class B Common Stock.

Table of Contents
Anti-takeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the Company or reduce the price of our common stock.
There are provisions within our articles of incorporation and Oregon law intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the Board of Directors a means to attempt to deny
coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms. Such provisions include a control share acquisition statute, a freeze-out
statute, two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues, and the fact that holders of Class A Common Stock elect three-quarters of the Board of Directors rounded down to
the next whole number. However, such provisions could discourage, delay or prevent an unsolicited merger, acquisition or other change in control of the Company that some
shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price. These provisions
could also discourage proxy contests for control of the Company.
We have in the past failed and may in the future fail to meet market expectations, which has caused and could in the future cause the price of our stock to decline.
Our Class B Common Stock is traded publicly, and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us. These reports include information
about our historical financial results as well as analysts' opinions of our future performance, which may, in part, be based upon any guidance we have provided. Analysts' estimates
are often different from our estimates or expectations. If our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors, our stock price could
decline (which has recently happened in the past and could happen in the future). We are currently subject to multiple securities class action and shareholder derivative lawsuits
relating to a drop in our stock price and could become involved in additional litigation of this type in the future if our stock price is volatile for any reason. Any litigation could result in
reputational damage, substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources needed to successfully run our business.

## ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS
None.
## ITEM 1C. CYBERSECURITY
At NIKE, cybersecurity risk management is an important part of our overall risk management efforts. We have cybersecurity processes, technologies and controls in place to aid in our efforts to assess, identify and manage material risks associated with cybersecurity threats. We assess cybersecurity risk at both the board and management levels.

### Management's Role in Managing Risk
At the management level, primary responsibility for assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats rests with our Vice President, Corporate Information Security, Risk & Compliance ("VP, CIS"). Our VP, CIS has over two decades of experience in information technology and cybersecurity. The VP, CIS reports to our Chief Information Officer ("CIO") who has significant experience leading technology teams at large public companies and our CIO reports to our Chief Technology Officer.

Our approach to managing cybersecurity risk is informed by the industry-standard National Institute for Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework. The VP, CIS has primary responsibility for implementing and overseeing our enterprise-wide cybersecurity strategy, policy, architecture and processes. We use various tools and methodologies to identify and manage cybersecurity risk, including risk assessments and a vulnerability management program that includes periodic penetration testing. We have a third-party cyber risk management program that conducts assessments on third parties who integrate with our data, network, systems and applications. These tools and methodologies inform our remediation activities, which are tracked and reported to senior management.

In addition, our internal audit function periodically conducts independent testing of the overall operations of our cybersecurity program and supporting control frameworks, and reports the results to the Audit & Finance Committee. We also engage third parties to assess our cybersecurity program maturity and to perform audits of portions of our cybersecurity control environment based on risk or where necessary to ensure regulatory compliance.

Our cybersecurity team meets frequently to monitor the prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of cybersecurity threats and incidents. In the event of a cybersecurity incident, we have an incident response plan that governs our immediate response including detection, escalation, assessment, management and remediation. As part of incident response, the cybersecurity team will also coordinate with external advisors and other key stakeholders as needed. The cybersecurity team routinely tests this plan across the organization to validate the procedures for appropriately escalating potentially material cybersecurity risks and incidents. Also, we provide an annual, mandatory cybersecurity training program for employees that is intended to help them understand cybersecurity risks and comply with our cybersecurity policies.

### Board Oversight
Our Board of Directors has ultimate oversight of cybersecurity risk as part of its risk management oversight responsibilities, including with respect to cybersecurity risk priorities, resource allocation and oversight structures. The Board of Directors receives an update on our cybersecurity program on an annual basis, or more frequently as determined to be necessary or advisable. The Board of Directors has delegated risk management oversight responsibility for information security and data protection to the Audit & Finance Committee, which regularly reviews our cybersecurity program and related matters with management and reports to the Board of Directors. Topics discussed at the board level include our approach to cybersecurity risk management, key initiatives, the threat landscape and recent developments and trends. The Board of Directors is aware of the critical nature of managing risks associated with cybersecurity threats and is actively engaged in our cybersecurity risk management strategy.

### Risks from Cybersecurity Threats
Even though, to date, cybersecurity risks have not materially affected our business or our results of operations, we face numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats. There can be no assurance that we, or the third parties with which we interact, will not face a cybersecurity incident in the future that will materially affect us. For more information about the cybersecurity risks we face, see the risk factor entitled "We rely significantly on information technology to operate our business, including our supply chain and retail operations, and any failure, inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business" in Item 1A. Risk Factors.

## ITEM 2. PROPERTIES
The following is a summary of principal properties owned or leased by NIKE:

The NIKE World Headquarters, owned by NIKE and located near Beaverton, Oregon, USA, is an approximately 400-acre site consisting of over 40 buildings which, together with
adjacent leased properties, functions as our global headquarters and is occupied by approximately 10,700 employees engaged in management, research, design, development,
marketing, finance and other administrative functions serving nearly all of our segments. We lease a similar, but smaller, administrative facility in Hilversum, the Netherlands, which
serves as the headquarters for our Europe, Middle East & Africa geography and management of certain brand functions for our non-U.S. operations. We also lease an office complex
in Shanghai, China, our headquarters for our Greater China geography, occupied by employees focused on implementing our wholesale, NIKE Direct and merchandising strategies in
the region, among other functions.

In the United States, NIKE has eight significant distribution centers. Five are located in or near Memphis, Tennessee, two of which are owned and three of which are leased. Two other
distribution centers, one located in Indianapolis, Indiana and one located in Dayton, Tennessee, are leased and operated by third-party logistics providers. One distribution center for
Converse is located in Ontario, California, which is leased. NIKE has a number of distribution facilities outside the United States, some of which are leased and operated by third-party
logistics providers. The most significant distribution facilities outside the United States are located in Laakdal, Belgium; Taicang, China; Tomisato, Japan and Icheon, Korea, all of
which we own.

Air Manufacturing Innovation manufactures cushioning components used in footwear at NIKE-owned and leased facilities located near Beaverton, Oregon, and in Dong Nai Province,
Vietnam, as well as at NIKE-owned facilities in St. Charles, Missouri.

Aside from the principal properties described above, we lease many offices worldwide for sales and administrative purposes. We lease approximately 1,040 retail stores worldwide,
which primarily consist of factory stores. See "United States Market" and "International Markets" for additional information regarding our retail stores. Our leases expire at various
dates through the fiscal year 2058.

## ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
We do not believe there are any material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business, to which we are a party or of which any of our
property is the subject. Refer to Note 16 — Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

# PERFORMANCE GRAPH
The following graph demonstrates a five-year comparison of cumulative total returns for NIKE's Class B Common Stock; the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index; the Dow Jones U.S.
Footwear Index; and the Standard & Poor's Apparel, Accessories & Luxury Goods Index. The graph assumes an investment of $100 on May 31, 2019, in each of the indices and our
Class B Common Stock. Each of the indices assumes that all dividends were reinvested on the day of issuance.

NKE_2024.jpg

The Dow Jones U.S. Footwear Index consists of NIKE, Crocs Inc., Deckers Outdoor Corporation and Skechers U.S.A., Inc. Because NIKE is part of the Dow Jones U.S. Footwear
Index, the price and returns of NIKE stock have a substantial effect on this index. The Standard & Poor's Apparel, Accessories & Luxury Goods Index consists of Ralph Lauren
Corporation, Tapestry, Inc. and lululemon athletica. The Dow Jones U.S. Footwear Index and the Standard & Poor's Apparel, Accessories & Luxury Goods Index include companies in
two major lines of business in which the Company competes. The indices do not encompass all of the Company's competitors, nor all product categories and lines of business in
which the Company is engaged.

The stock performance shown on the performance graph above is not necessarily indicative of future performance. The Company will not make or endorse any predictions as to future
stock performance.

The performance graph above is being furnished solely to accompany this Annual Report pursuant to Item 201(e) of Regulation S-K, is not being filed for purposes of Section 18 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is not to be incorporated by reference into any filing of the Company, whether made before or after the date hereof, regardless of

# ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
# FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

## OVERVIEW
NIKE designs, develops, markets and sells athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services worldwide. We are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the
world. We sell our products through NIKE Direct operations, which are comprised of both NIKE-owned retail stores and sales through our digital platforms (also referred to as "NIKE
Brand Digital") and to wholesale accounts, which include a mix of independent distributors, licensees and sales representatives in nearly all countries around the world. Our goal is to
deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear, apparel, equipment and accessories businesses.

Our strategy is to achieve sustainable profitable long-term revenue growth by creating innovative, "must-have" products, building deep personal consumer connections with our brands
and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail. We are focused on growing the entire marketplace by continuing to invest in our NIKE Direct
operations while also increasing investment to elevate and differentiate our brand experience within our wholesale partners.

In addition, in the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we announced an enterprise-wide initiative to prioritize investment to fuel future growth including taking steps to streamline the
organization. This resulted in a net reduction of our global workforce and we expect to reinvest a majority of the future annual wage savings from these actions to support this initiative.

We also continue to invest in a global Enterprise Resource Planning Platform, data and analytics, demand sensing, insight gathering and other areas to create an end-to end
technology foundation to serve our consumer with speed and scale.

## FISCAL 2024 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
*   NIKE, Inc. Revenues for fiscal 2024 were $51.4 billion compared to $51.2 billion for fiscal 2023
*   NIKE Direct revenues grew 1% from $21.3 billion in fiscal 2023 to $21.5 billion in fiscal 2024, and represented approximately 44% of total NIKE Brand revenues for fiscal 2024
*   NIKE Brand wholesale revenues increased 1% on a reported basis and 2% on a currency-neutral basis
*   Gross margin increased 110 basis points to 44.6%, primarily due to strategic pricing actions and lower ocean freight rates and logistics costs, partially offset by higher product
    input costs, lower margin in NIKE Direct and unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates
*   Income before income taxes included a restructuring charge of $443 million related to the streamlining of our organization, primarily associated with employee severance costs
    and accelerated stock-based compensation expense. For more information, refer to Note 19 — Restructuring within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements.
*   Inventories as of May 31, 2024 were $7.5 billion, a decrease of 11% compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in units
*   We returned $6.4 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2024 through share repurchases and dividends
*   Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC") was 34.9% as of May 31, 2024, compared to 31.5% as of May 31, 2023. ROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, see "Use of
    Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for additional information.

For discussion related to the results of operations and changes in financial condition for fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022 refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our fiscal 2023 Form 10-K, which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission on July 20, 2023.

CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS IMPACTING OUR BUSINESS
The operating environment could remain volatile in fiscal 2025 as the risk remains that these factors, among others, could have a material adverse impact on our future revenue
growth as well as overall profitability.
Consumer Spending: In fiscal 2024, consumers continued to spend more cautiously as the global economy remains uncertain and promotional activity remained high across our
industry. We will continue to closely monitor macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, including potential impacts of inflation and higher interest rates on consumer spending
behavior.
Cost Inflationary Pressures: Inflationary pressures, including higher product input costs, continued to negatively impact our gross margin with more pronounced impacts in the
first nine months of fiscal 2024. These negative impacts were more than offset by the strategic pricing actions we have taken through fiscal 2024, as well as improvements in
ocean freight rates and logistics costs we started to realize at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2024.
Supply Chain Conditions: During fiscal 2024 and as of May 31, 2024, our inventory levels were healthy, reflecting our proactive actions taken to manage our inventory supply.
Foreign Currency Impacts: As a global company with significant operations outside the United States, we are exposed to risk arising from changes in foreign currency
exchange rates. For additional information, refer to "Foreign Currency Exposures and Hedging Practices".
Product Lifecycle Management: We are currently reducing the supply of certain footwear products as we scale new and innovative products across the marketplace. This had a
negative impact on our revenues, specifically NIKE Brand Digital revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.
For more information refer to Item 1A Risk Factors, within Part 1, Item 1, Business.
USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we discuss non-GAAP financial measures, which should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, the financial measures
calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). References to these measures should not be
considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
used by other companies. Management uses these non-GAAP measures when evaluating the Company's performance, including when making financial and operating decisions.
Additionally, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our
underlying business performance and trends.
Earnings Before Interest and Taxes ("EBIT"): Calculated as Net income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Total NIKE, Inc. EBIT for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:

RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL
34.9%
31.5%

(1) Equals Earnings before interest and taxes multiplied by the effective tax rate as of each of the respective quarter ends.
(2) Total debt includes the following: 1) Current portion of long-term debt, 2) Notes Payable, 3) Current portion of operating lease liabilities, 4) Long-term debt and 5) Operating lease liabilities.

Currency-neutral revenues: Currency-neutral revenues enhance visibility to underlying business trends, excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange
rate fluctuations. Currency-neutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period in place of the exchange rates in use during
the current period.

Wholesale equivalent revenues: References to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our NIKE Brand market footprint if we had no
NIKE Direct operations. NIKE Brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of (1) sales to external wholesale customers and (2) internal sales from our wholesale operations to our
NIKE Direct operations, which are charged at prices comparable to those charged to external wholesale customers. Beginning in fiscal 2025, with the continued rollout of a new
Enterprise Resource Planning Platform, the Company will replace wholesale equivalent revenues and gross margin drivers with a comparable U.S. GAAP metric.

COMPARABLE STORE SALES

Comparable store sales: This key metric, which excludes NIKE Brand Digital sales, comprises revenues from NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores for which all three of the
following requirements have been met: (1) the store has been open at least one year, (2) square footage has not changed by more than 15% within the past year and (3) the store has
not been permanently repositioned within the past year. Comparable store sales represents a performance metric that we believe is useful information for management and investors
in understanding the performance of our established NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores. Management considers this metric when making financial and operating decisions. The
method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of this metric may not be comparable to similarly titled metrics used by other
companies.

in Converse, which reduced NIKE, Inc. Revenues by approximately 1 percentage point.</li>
<li>NIKE Brand revenues, which represented over 90% of NIKE, Inc. Revenues, increased 1% on both a reported and currency-neutral basis. The increase, on a currency-neutral
basis, was primarily due to higher revenues in the Jordan Brand and Men's.
<ul>
<li>NIKE Brand footwear revenues increased 1% on a currency-neutral basis, primarily due to higher revenues in the Jordan Brand, Men's and Women's. Unit sales of
footwear decreased 2%, while higher average selling price ("ASP") per pair contributed approximately 3 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per
pair was primarily due to higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, on a wholesale equivalent basis, and a higher mix of NIKE Direct sales, partially offset by lower NIKE
Direct ASP.</li>
<li>NIKE Brand apparel revenues were flat on a currency-neutral basis, primarily due to lower revenues in Men's and Women's, offset by higher revenues in Kids'. Unit sales
of apparel decreased 9%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 9 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. Higher ASP per unit was primarily due to
higher full-price, off-price and NIKE Direct ASPs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>NIKE Brand wholesale revenues increased 1% on a reported basis and 2% on a currency-neutral basis, compared to fiscal 2023. Higher revenues in Greater China and APLA
were partially offset by lower revenues in North America.</li>
<li>NIKE Direct revenues increased 1% to $21.5 billion in fiscal 2024 compared to $21.3 billion in fiscal 2023. On a currency-neutral basis, NIKE Direct revenues increased 1%,
primarily driven by comparable store sales growth of 3% and the addition of new stores, partially offset by declines in NIKE Brand Digital sales of 3%, reflecting reduced digital
traffic. For additional information regarding comparable store sales, including the definition, see "Comparable Store Sales". NIKE Brand Digital sales were $12.1 billion for fiscal
2024 compared to $12.4 billion for fiscal 2023. Within NIKE Direct revenues, there were certain reclassifications made between NIKE-owned retail stores and NIKE Brand Digital
in the prior period to conform to current period presentation. The reclassifications did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.</li>

# GROSS MARGIN
## FISCAL 2024 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2023
For fiscal 2024, our consolidated gross profit increased 3% to $22,887 million compared to $22,292 million for fiscal 2023. Gross margin increased 110 basis points to 44.6% for fiscal
2024 compared to 43.5% for fiscal 2023 due to the following:
03 427857-3_bar_gross margin.jpg
The increase in gross margin for fiscal 2024 was primarily due to:
*   Higher NIKE Brand full-price ASP, net of discounts, on a wholesale equivalent basis (increasing gross margin approximately 200 basis points), primarily due to strategic pricing
    actions;
*   Lower NIKE Brand product costs, on a wholesale equivalent basis (increasing gross margin approximately 10 basis points), primarily due to lower ocean freight rates and logistics
    costs largely offset by higher product input costs; and
*   Lower other costs (increasing gross margin approximately 10 basis points).

This was partially offset by:
*   Unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates, including hedges (decreasing gross margin approximately 40 basis points);
*   Lower margin in our NIKE Direct business (decreasing gross margin approximately 40 basis points);
*   Lower off-price margin, on a wholesale equivalent basis (decreasing gross margin approximately 20 basis points); and
*   Restructuring charges (decreasing gross margin approximately 10 basis points).

<sup>(1)</sup> Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, complimentary product, television, digital and print advertising and media costs, brand events and retail
brand presentation.

## FISCAL 2024 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2023
Demand creation expense increased 6% for fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher advertising and marketing expense, digital marketing and sports marketing expense. Changes in
foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on Demand creation expense.

Operating overhead expense was flat, as lower wage-related expenses and lower technology spend were offset by restructuring charges. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates
did not have a material impact on Operating overhead expense.

For more information related to our organizational realignment and related costs, refer to Note 19 — Restructuring within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Other (income) expense, net comprises foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, as well as unusual or non-operating transactions that are outside the normal course of business.

## FISCAL 2024 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2023
Other (income) expense, net decreased from $280 million of other income, net in fiscal 2023 to $228 million in the current fiscal year, primarily due to a net unfavorable change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses, including hedges, as well as net favorable settlements of legal matters in the prior year. These items were partially offset by the loss recognized in the prior year upon completion of the sale of our entities in Argentina and Uruguay to a third-party distributor.

For more information related to the sale of our entities in Argentina and Uruguay to a third-party distributor, see Note 18 — Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses, and the year-over-year change in foreign currency-related gains and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact on our Income before income taxes of $68 million for fiscal 2024.

| Effective tax rate | 14.9 % | 18.2 % | (330) bps | 9.1 % | 910 bps |

## FISCAL 2024 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2023
Our effective tax rate was 14.9% for fiscal 2024, compared to 18.2% for fiscal 2023, primarily due to changes in earnings mix and one-time items including the benefit provided by the delay of the effective date of certain U.S. foreign tax credit regulations in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.

The OECD and the Inclusive Framework has put forth Pillar Two proposals that ensure a minimal level of taxation. Several countries in which we operate, including several European Union member states, have adopted domestic legislation to implement the Inclusive Framework's global corporate minimum tax rate of fifteen percent which will be effective for NIKE beginning June 1, 2024. Other countries are also actively considering changes to their tax laws to adopt certain parts of the Inclusive Framework's proposals. Based on our current analysis of Pillar Two provisions, we do not expect these tax law changes to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements; however, we will continue to evaluate their impact as additional information becomes available.

FISCAL 2024 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2023
*   North America revenues decreased 1% on a currency-neutral basis, primarily due to lower revenues in Men's and Women's, partially offset by higher revenues in the Jordan Brand. Wholesale revenues decreased 2%, primarily reflecting liquidation of excess inventory in the prior year. NIKE Direct revenues increased 1%, primarily driven by the addition of new stores, partially offset by a decline in digital sales of 1%. Comparable store sales for fiscal 2024 were flat.
*   Footwear revenues decreased 2% on a currency-neutral basis due to lower revenues in Men's, Kids' and Women's, partially offset by higher revenues in the Jordan Brand. Unit sales of footwear decreased 7%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 5 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to higher full-price ASP and a higher mix of NIKE Direct sales, partially offset by lower NIKE Direct ASP.
*   Apparel revenues were flat on a currency-neutral basis due to lower revenues in Men's, Women's and the Jordan Brand, offset by higher revenues in Kids'. Unit sales of apparel decreased 6%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 6 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. Higher ASP per unit was primarily due to higher full-price ASP.

Reported EBIT increased 7% reflecting lower revenues and the following:

*   Gross margin expansion of 220 basis points primarily due to higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, largely due to strategic pricing actions and lower discounts, as well as lower product costs. Lower product costs were primarily due to lower ocean freight rates and logistics costs, partially offset by higher product input costs.
*   Selling and administrative expense increase of 1% due to higher demand creation expense, partially offset by lower operating overhead expense. The increase in demand creation expense was primarily due to higher digital marketing and sports marketing expense. Operating overhead expense decreased primarily due to lower wage-related expenses, partially offset by higher other administrative costs.

Unit sales of apparel increased 7%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 7 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. Higher ASP per unit was primarily due to higher NIKE Direct, full-price and off-price ASPs as well as a higher mix of full-price sales.

Reported EBIT increased 1% reflecting higher revenues and the following:

*   Gross margin contraction of approximately 80 basis points, primarily due to unfavorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, and lower other costs. The higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, was largely due to strategic pricing actions, partially offset by product mix.

*   Selling and administrative expense increase of 2% due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expense. Demand creation expense increased primarily due to higher advertising and marketing expense and retail brand presentation expense, partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Operating overhead expense increased primarily due to higher other administrative costs, partially offset by favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

We completed the sale of our entity in Chile and our entities in Argentina and Uruguay to third-party distributors in the first and second quarters of fiscal 2023, respectively. The
impacts of closing these transactions are included within Corporate and are not reflected in the APLA operating segment results. This completed the transition of our NIKE Brand
businesses within our CASA marketplace, which now reflects a full distributor operating model. For more information see Note 18 — Divestitures within the accompanying Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

## FISCAL 2024 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2023

*   APLA revenues increased 5% on a currency-neutral basis primarily due to higher revenues in Southeast Asia & India, Mexico and Japan. Within our CASA territory, the transition
    of our Chile, Argentina and Uruguay entities to a third-party distributor operating model did not have a material impact on APLA revenues. Revenues increased due to overall
    growth in Men's, Women's, the Jordan Brand and Kids'. Wholesale revenues increased 6%. NIKE Direct revenues increased 4%, driven by comparable store sales growth of
    10% and the addition of new stores, partially offset by a decline in digital sales of 2%.
*   Footwear revenues increased 7% on a currency-neutral basis due to higher revenues in Men's, Women's, the Jordan Brand and Kids'. Unit sales of footwear increased 6%, while
    higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 1 percentage point of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to higher full-price ASP, off-price ASP and a
    higher mix of NIKE Direct sales, partially offset by lower NIKE Direct ASP.
*   Apparel revenues decreased 2% on a currency-neutral basis, primarily due to lower revenues in Men's and Women's, partially offset by higher revenues in the Jordan Brand. Unit
    sales of apparel decreased 9%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 7 percentage points of apparel revenue growth. Higher ASP per unit was primarily due to
    higher full-price ASP, off-price ASP and a higher mix of NIKE Direct sales, partially offset by lower NIKE Direct ASP.
*   Reported EBIT decreased 2% reflecting higher revenues and the following:
*   Gross margin contraction of approximately 220 basis points primarily due to unfavorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, lower margin in NIKE Direct and
    higher product costs, reflecting higher product input costs and product mix. This was partially offset by higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, primarily due to product mix and
    strategic pricing actions.
*   Selling and administrative expense increase of 4% due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expense. Demand creation expense increased primarily due to higher
    digital marketing and sports marketing expense. Operating overhead expense increased primarily due to higher other administrative costs.

Global Brand Divisions primarily represent demand creation and operating overhead expense, including product creation and design expenses that are centrally managed for the NIKE
Brand, as well as costs associated with NIKE Direct global digital operations and enterprise technology. Global Brand Divisions revenues include NIKE Brand licensing and other
miscellaneous revenues that are not part of a geographic operating segment.

**FISCAL 2024 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2023**
Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes decreased 2% primarily due to lower operating overhead expense, partially offset by higher demand creation expense. Lower
operating overhead expense was primarily due to lower wage-related expenses, technology spend and other administrative costs. The increase in demand creation expense was
primarily due to higher advertising and marketing expense as well as digital marketing.

(1) Other revenues consist of territories serviced by third-party licensees who pay royalties to Converse for the use of its registered trademarks and other intellectual property rights. We do not own the Converse trademarks
in Japan and accordingly do not earn revenues in Japan.

**FISCAL 2024 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2023**
*   Converse revenues decreased 15% on a currency-neutral basis primarily due to declines in North America and Western Europe. Combined unit sales within the wholesale and
    direct to consumer channels decreased 12%, driven primarily by a decrease in wholesale, while ASP decreased 3%, primarily driven by increased promotional activity in direct to
    consumer.
*   Wholesale revenues decreased 16% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by declines in all geographies.
*   Direct to consumer revenues decreased 14% on a currency-neutral basis as declines in North America and Western Europe, driven by reduced traffic, were partially offset by
    growth in Asia.

Reported EBIT decreased 30% reflecting lower revenues and the following:

*   Gross margin contraction of approximately 130 basis points due to unfavorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, lower full-price ASP, net of discounts,
    higher other costs and lower margin in direct to consumer, partially offset by lower ocean freight rates.
*   Selling and administrative expense decrease of 2% due to lower operating overhead expense, primarily as a result of lower wage-related expenses.

Corporate revenues primarily consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program.

The Corporate loss before interest and taxes primarily consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses.

In addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in Corporate revenues, foreign currency results in Corporate include gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard rates used to record non-functional currency denominated product purchases within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse; related foreign currency hedge results; conversion gains and losses arising from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non-functional currencies; and certain other foreign currency derivative instruments.

## FISCAL 2024 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2023
Corporate's loss before interest and taxes decreased $221 million during fiscal 2024, primarily due to the following:

*   a favorable change in net foreign currency gains and losses of $588 million related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments and Converse, net of hedge gains and losses; these results are reported as a component of consolidated Gross profit;
*   a favorable change of $80 million primarily related to lower wage-related expenses, partially offset by higher professional services, reported as a component of consolidated Operating overhead expense;
*   a favorable change of $27 million primarily related to the loss recognized in the prior year upon completion of the sale of our entities in Argentina and Uruguay to a third-party distributor, partially offset by the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments, as well as net favorable settlements of legal matters in the prior year, reported as a component of consolidated Other (income) expense, net; and
*   an unfavorable change of $443 million related to restructuring charges, $379 million reported as a component of consolidated Operating overhead expense and $64 million reported as a component of consolidated Cost of sales.

# FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES AND HEDGING PRACTICES

## OVERVIEW
As a global company with significant operations outside the United States, in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U.S. Dollars.

Our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to NIKE, Inc. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and, where practical and material, by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the implementation of the NIKE Trading Company ("NTC") and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our Consolidated Financial Statements; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Refer to Note 4 Fair Value Measurements and Note 12 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
description of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end.

# TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES
We conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk. Our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are:
*   Product Costs NIKE's product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways:

    1.  Product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity:

        a.  Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NTC, a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories, predominantly in U.S.
            Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the products to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a NIKE
            entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the NTC.
        b.  Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories predominantly in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those
            NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.

        In both purchasing scenarios, a weaker U.S. Dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by NIKE whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar increases its cost.
    2.  Factory input costs: NIKE operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories. The program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk
        by assuming certain of the factories' foreign currency exposures, some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures. Under this program, our
        payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies ("factory currency exposure index") in which the labor, materials and overhead
        costs incurred by the factories in the production of NIKE branded products ("factory input costs") are denominated.

        As an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating U.S. Dollar on our non-functional currency denominated product purchases described above, a strengthening U.S. Dollar
        against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces NIKE's U.S. Dollar inventory cost. Conversely, a weakening U.S. Dollar against the
        indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost.
*   Non-Functional Currency Denominated External Sales A portion of our NIKE Brand and Converse revenues associated with European operations are earned in currencies
    other than the Euro (e.g., the British Pound) but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the Euro as its functional currency. These sales generate a foreign currency exposure.
*   Other Costs Non-functional currency denominated costs, such as endorsement contracts, also generate foreign currency risk, though to a lesser extent.
*   Non-Functional Currency Denominated Monetary Assets and Liabilities Our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, including
    intercompany receivables and payables, denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may
    create fluctuations in Other (income) expense, net within our Consolidated Statements of Income.

# MANAGING TRANSACTIONAL EXPOSURES
Transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program. We manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets
and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on
probable forecasted future cash flows, including certain product cost exposures, non-functional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above. Generally,
these are accounted for as cash flow hedges.

Certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement
are not formally designated as hedging instruments. Accordingly, changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in Other (income) expense, net and are intended to offset
the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related non-functional currency denominated asset or liability being hedged.

# TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES
Many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are
required to translate the balance sheets, operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of foreign subsidiaries'
non-U.S. Dollar denominated balance sheets into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) within Shareholders' equity. In the translation of our Consolidated Statements of Income, a weaker U.S. Dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our
consolidated earnings whereas a stronger U.S. Dollar reduces our consolidated earnings. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated
Revenues was a detriment of approximately $141 million for the year ended May 31, 2024. The impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our Income before
income taxes was a benefit of approximately $48 million for the year ended May 31, 2024.

# MANAGING TRANSLATIONAL EXPOSURES
To minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into U.S. Dollars for consolidated reporting, certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash
to purchase U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments. The variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these U.S. Dollar
denominated investments at non-U.S. Dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP. We utilize
forward contracts and/or options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these U.S. Dollar investments. The combination of the purchase and sale of
the U.S. Dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the year-over-year foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the
investments are sold. Hedges of the purchase of U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges.

We estimate the combination of translation of foreign currency-denominated profits from our international businesses and the year-over-year change in foreign currency related gains
and losses included in Other (income) expense, net had an unfavorable impact of approximately $68 million on our Income before income taxes for the year ended May 31, 2024.

# NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES
We are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in wholly-owned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar,
which could adversely impact the U.S. Dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings. We have, in the past, hedged and may, in the future,
hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. These hedges are accounted for as net
investment hedges in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2024 and 2023. There were no cash flows from net investment
hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

# LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

## CASH FLOW ACTIVITY
Cash provided (used) by operations was an inflow of $7,429 million for fiscal 2024, compared to $5,841 million for fiscal 2023. Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, generated
$6,713 million of operating cash inflow for fiscal 2024, compared to $6,354 million for fiscal 2023. The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in an
increase to Cash provided (used) by operations of $716 million for fiscal 2024 compared to a decrease of $513 million for fiscal 2023. For fiscal 2024, the favorable net change in
working capital compared to the prior year was primarily impacted by favorable changes to Inventories due to reduced inventory purchases and improved lead times, partially offset by
unfavorable changes to Accounts receivable due to the timing of wholesale shipments.

Cash provided (used) by investing activities was an inflow of $894 million for fiscal 2024, compared to an inflow of $564 million for fiscal 2023, primarily driven by the net change in
short-term investments (including sales, maturities and purchases). For fiscal 2024, the net change in short-term investments resulted in a cash inflow of $1,721 million compared to a
cash inflow of $1,481 million for fiscal 2023.

Cash provided (used) by financing activities was an outflow of $5,888 million for fiscal 2024 compared to an outflow of $7,447 million for fiscal 2023. The decreased outflow in fiscal
2024 was driven by lower share repurchases of $4,250 million for fiscal 2024 compared to $5,480 million for fiscal 2023, partially offset by higher dividend payments of $2,169 million
for fiscal 2024 compared to $2,012 million for fiscal 2023.

In fiscal 2024, we purchased a total of 41.4 million shares of NIKE's Class B Common Stock for $4.3 billion (an average price of $102.72 per share) under the four-year, $18 billion
share repurchase plan authorized by the Board of Directors in June 2022. As of May 31, 2024, we had repurchased 84.9 million shares at a cost of approximately $9.1 billion (an
average price of $106.65 per share) under this program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows. The timing and the amount of share
repurchases will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions.

**CAPITAL RESOURCES**

On July 21, 2022, we filed a shelf registration statement (the "Shelf") with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of
debt securities from time to time. The Shelf expires on July 21, 2025.

On March 11, 2022, we entered into a five-year committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings, with the option to
increase borrowings up to $3 billion in total with lender approval. The facility matures on March 11, 2027, with options to extend the maturity date up to an additional two years. Refer
to Note 5 - Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines for additional information.

On March 8, 2024, we entered into a 364-day committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings, with the option to
increase borrowings up to $1.5 billion in total with lender approval. The facility matures on March 7, 2025, with an option to extend the maturity date an additional 364 days. This
facility replaces the prior $1 billion 364-day credit facility agreement entered into on March 10, 2023, which matured on March 8, 2024. Refer to Note 5 — Short-Term Borrowings and
Credit Lines for additional information.

We currently have long-term debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively. As it relates to our committed credit
facilities entered into on March 11, 2022 and March 8, 2024, if our long-term debt ratings were to decline, the facility fees and interest rates would increase. Conversely, if our long-
term debt ratings were to improve, the facility fees and interest rates would decrease. Changes in our long-term debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then-
outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities. Under these facilities, we have agreed to various covenants. These covenants include limits on
the disposal of assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur. In the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under these facilities, failed to meet any
covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the applicable syndicate, any borrowings would become immediately due and payable. As of May 31,
2024, we were in full compliance with each of these covenants, and we believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future.

Liquidity is also provided by our $3 billion commercial paper program. As of and for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023, we did not have any borrowings outstanding under
our $3 billion program. We may issue commercial paper or other debt securities depending on general corporate needs.

To date, we have not experienced difficulty accessing the capital or credit markets; however, future volatility may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other
debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets.

As of May 31, 2024, we had Cash and equivalents and Short-term investments totaling $11.6 billion, primarily consisting of commercial paper, corporate notes, deposits held at major
banks, money market funds, U.S. Treasury obligations and other investment grade fixed-income securities. Our fixed-income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate
risk. All of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk. While individual securities have varying durations, as of May 31, 2024, the weighted-average days to
maturity of our cash equivalents and short-term investments portfolio was 65 days.

We believe that existing Cash and equivalents, Short-term investments and cash generated by operations, together with access to external sources of funds as described above, will
be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future.

Our material cash requirements as of May 31, 2024, were as follows:

*   Debt Obligations — Refer to Note 5 — Short-Term Borrowings and Credit Lines and Note 6 — Long-Term Debt in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial
    Statements for additional information.
*   Operating Leases — Refer to Note 17 — Leases in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Table of Contents

*   Endorsement Contracts - As of May 31, 2024, we had endorsement contract obligations of $10.6 billion, with $1.7 billion payable within 12 months, representing
    approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete, public figure, sport team and league endorsers of our
    products. Actual payments under some contracts may be higher than these amounts as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic
    achievements and/or royalties on product sales in future periods. Actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for
    reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods. In addition to the cash payments, we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with NIKE product for their
    use. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many
    factors and the contracts generally do not stipulate a minimum amount of cash to be spent on the product.
*   Product Purchase Obligations - As of May 31, 2024, we had product purchase obligations of $5.7 billion, all of which are payable within the next 12 months. Product
    purchase obligations represent agreements (including open purchase orders) to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding
    and specify all significant terms. We generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced orders received from external
    wholesale customers and internal orders from our direct to consumer operations. In some cases, prices are subject to change throughout the production process.
*   Other Purchase Obligations - As of May 31, 2024, we had $3.5 billion of other purchase obligations, with $1.9 billion payable within the next 12 months. Other purchase
    obligations primarily include technology investments, construction, service and marketing commitments, including marketing commitments associated with endorsement
    contracts, made in the ordinary course of business. The amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all
    significant terms, and may include open purchase orders for non-product purchases.

In addition to the above, we have long-term obligations for uncertain tax positions and various post-retirement benefits for which we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash
payments will occur. Refer to Note 7 Income Taxes and Note 11 - Benefit Plans in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information
related to uncertain tax positions and post-retirement benefits, respectively.

As a part of the transition tax related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as of May 31, 2024, we had $483 million in estimated future cash payments, with $215 million payable within the
next 12 months. These amounts represent the transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, which are reflected net of foreign tax credits we
utilized.

Refer to Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our off-balance sheet
arrangements, bank guarantees and letters of credit.

**OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS**

As of May 31, 2024, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material effect on our current and future financial condition,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. In connection with various contracts and agreements, we routinely provide indemnification relating to the
enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor. Currently, we have several such agreements in
place. Based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial
position or results of operations.

**NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS**

Refer to Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted and issued accounting
standards.

**CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES**

Our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements.

We believe the assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting estimates described below have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, so we
consider these to be our critical accounting estimates. Management has reviewed and discussed these critical accounting estimates with the Audit & Finance Committee of the Board
of Directors.

2024 FORM 10-K 48

# Page 52 of 103

# Table of Contents

Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters, actual results could differ from the estimates we use in the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements. Within the
context of these critical accounting estimates, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being
reported.

# SALES-RELATED RESERVES

Provisions for anticipated sales returns consist of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. Provisions for post-invoice sales discounts consist of both
contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date.

Estimates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts and claims are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers
and outstanding discounts and claims and (3) estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future
period are inherently uncertain and may differ from estimates recorded. If actual or expected future returns, discounts or claims were significantly different than reserves established, a
reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made.

Refer to Note 14 - Revenues in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

# INVENTORY RESERVES

We make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If we estimate the net
realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory, we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable
value. This reserve is recorded as a charge to Cost of sales. If changes in market conditions result in reductions to the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our
previous estimate, we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination.

# HEDGE ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES

We use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain non-functional currency monetary assets and liabilities.
When the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met, changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), rather than Net income, until the underlying hedged transaction affects Net income. In most cases, this results in gains and losses
on hedge derivatives being released from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into Net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative. One of the criteria for this
accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of the designated amount of anticipated transactions. By their very nature, our
estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions. When the designated amount of anticipated or actual transactions
decline below hedged levels, or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period
of time thereafter, we reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the over-hedged portion of the related hedge contract from Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to
Other (income) expense, net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs. In rare circumstances, the additional period of time may exceed two months due to extenuating
circumstances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside our control or influence.

Refer to Note 12 - Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

# INCOME TAXES

We are subject to taxation in the United States, as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the
use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. On an interim basis, we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year. This estimated annual
effective tax rate is then applied to the year-to-date Income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items, to determine the year-to-date Income tax expense.
The income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur. As the fiscal year progresses, we continually refine our estimate based
upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year. This continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year.
When this occurs, we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs.

On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on
factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. Changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax
benefit or an

# Table of Contents

additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense.
Refer to Note 7 - Income Taxes in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

# OTHER CONTINGENCIES
In the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various legal proceedings, claims and government investigations related to our business, products and actions of our employees
and representatives, including contractual and employment relationships, product liability, antitrust, customs, tax, intellectual property and other matters. We record contingent
liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable. Assessing probability of loss and estimating
probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors, including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts. Recorded contingent liabilities
are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. If future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses
exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred. In addition to contingent
liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability.
Refer to Note 16 — Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

# ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES
# ABOUT MARKET RISK
In the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures, we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value
of foreign currencies and interest rates. It is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures; we do not enter
into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes.
We are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily as a result of our international sales, product sourcing and funding activities. Our foreign exchange risk management
program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We use
forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated, but not yet firmly committed, transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables,
including third-party and intercompany transactions. Where exposures are hedged, our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our
Consolidated Financial Statements.
The timing for hedging exposures, as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed, are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of
the exposure and prevailing market conditions. Typically, the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may
place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2024, are designated as
foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro, Chinese Yuan/U.S. Dollar, and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. Refer to Note 12
Risk Management and Derivatives in the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Our earnings are also exposed to movements in short- and long-term market interest rates. Our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate
changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we maintain a mix of commercial paper, bank loans, and fixed-rate debt of
varying maturities and have entered into receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps for a portion of our fixed-rate debt.
# MARKET RISK MEASUREMENT
We monitor foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value, sensitivity analysis and Value-at-Risk
("VaR"). Our market-sensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, interest rate swaps, intercompany
loans denominated in non-functional currencies and fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt.
We use VaR to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only. The VaR determines the maximum potential
one-day loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial instruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level.
There are various modeling techniques that can be used in the VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates
(a "variance/co-variance" technique). These interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one-year
period. The value of foreign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in the underlying currency rate. We adjust the potential loss in option value for the
estimated sensitivity (the "delta" and "gamma") to changes in the underlying currency rate. This calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative
instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on non-functional currency transactions (such as anticipated transactions, firm commitments, cash balances
and accounts and loans receivable and payable), including those which are hedged by these instruments.
The VaR model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market
rates. It also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in
market rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge percentages, timing and other factors.
The estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $57 million and $111 million as
of May 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The VaR decreased year-over-year as a result of a decrease in foreign currency volatilities as of May 31, 2024. Such a hypothetical loss in
the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged. The average monthly change in the fair values of foreign
currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was $180 million and $289 million during fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively.
The instruments not included in the VaR are intercompany loans denominated in non-functional currencies, fixed interest rate U.S. Dollar denominated debt, and interest rate swaps.
Intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in

consolidation. Furthermore, our non-functional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts, which are
included in the VaR calculation above. Therefore, we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our non-functional currency intercompany loans to be
immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
Details of third-party debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected
maturity dates. The weighted average variable interest rates for the fixed rate swapped to variable rate swaps reflect the effective interest rates at May 31, 2024.

MANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER
FINANCIAL REPORTING
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13(a) - 15(f) and Rule 15(d) 15(f) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our
management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets of the Company
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
Under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting based upon the framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (COSO). Based on the results of our evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of May 31, 2024.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited (1) the Consolidated Financial Statements and (2) the effectiveness of our internal
control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2024, as stated in their report herein.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of NIKE, Inc.
Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company") as of May 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated
statements of income, of comprehensive income, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2024, including the related notes
and financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a) (2) (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). We also have audited the
Company's internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of May 31, 2024 and 2023, and
the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended May 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of May 31, 2024, based on criteria
established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.
Basis for Opinions
The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
to express opinions on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public
accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in
accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in
all material respects.
Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due
to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the
consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our
audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting
A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies
and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)
provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

## Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

### Accounting for Income Taxes

As described in Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is subject to taxation in the United States, as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. As disclosed by management, the determination of the provision for income taxes by management requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Furthermore, as part of determining its provision for income taxes, management evaluates the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, settled audit issues and new audit activity. The Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the financial statements only when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by relevant tax authorities. The majority of the total gross unrecognized tax benefits are long-term in nature and included within deferred income taxes and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company recorded income tax expense of $1,000 million for the year ended May 31, 2024. As of May 31, 2024, total gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, were $990 million, of which $699 million would affect the Company's effective tax rate if recognized in future periods.

The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the accounting for income taxes is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining the provision for income taxes and interpreting and applying complex tax laws as it relates to determining the provision for income taxes and uncertain tax positions; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management's interpretation and application of complex tax laws as it relates to the determination of the provision for income taxes and the assessment of whether tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.

Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to income taxes. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing the provision for income taxes, which included the effective tax rate reconciliation and assessing management's interpretation and application of complex tax laws; (ii) evaluating the completeness of management's identification of uncertain tax positions by considering changes in facts or circumstances, changes in and compliance with tax laws, settled audit issues, new authoritative cases, or new audit activity, where applicable; and (iii) for certain tax positions, evaluating management's assessment of the technical merits of the tax positions by obtaining and inspecting third party income tax documentation. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) changes in and compliance with the tax laws; (ii) management's interpretation and application of certain complex tax laws as it relates to the determination of the provision for income taxes; and (iii) the reasonableness of management's assessment of whether certain tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained.

# NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

## DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

NIKE, Inc. is a worldwide leader in the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE, Inc.
portfolio brands include the NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand and Converse. The NIKE Brand is focused on performance athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services
across Men's, Women's and Kids', amplified with sport-inspired lifestyle products carrying the Swoosh trademark, as well as other NIKE Brand trademarks. The Jordan Brand is
focused on athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories using the Jumpman trademark. Sales and operating results of Jordan Brand products are reported within the
respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments. Converse designs, distributes, licenses and sells casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the Converse, Chuck
Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. In some markets outside the U.S., these trademarks are licensed to third parties who design, distribute, market
and sell similar products. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.

## BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Company" or "NIKE"). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have
been eliminated.

## MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, including estimates relating to
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

## REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenue transactions associated with the sale of NIKE Brand footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as Converse products, comprise a single performance obligation, which
consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct to consumer channels. The Company satisfies the performance obligation and records revenues when
transfer of control to the customer has occurred, based on the terms of sale. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all
of the benefits of the product.

Control is transferred to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Control transfers to retail store
customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital commerce customers upon shipment. The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price, less
anticipated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the
customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer. Payment is due at the time of sale for retail store and digital
commerce transactions.

Consideration for trademark licensing contracts is earned through sales-based or usage-based royalty arrangements, and the associated revenues are recognized over the license
period.

Taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, and are collected by the Company from a
customer, are excluded from Revenues and Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a
product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in Cost of sales when the related revenues are recognized.

## SALES-RELATED RESERVES

Consideration promised in the Company's contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions, such as sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from
customers. The Company estimates the most likely amount it will be entitled to receive and records an anticipated reduction against Revenues, with an offsetting increase to Accrued
liabilities at the time revenues are recognized. The estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated
Balance Sheets.

The provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns. Provisions for post-invoice sales discounts consist of both
contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date.

Table of Contents
Estimates of discretionary authorized returns, discounts and claims are based on (1) historical rates, (2) specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers
and outstanding discounts and claims and (3) estimated returns, discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers. Actual returns, discounts and claims in any future
period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from estimates recorded. If actual or expected future returns, discounts or claims are significantly greater or lower than the reserves
established, a reduction or increase to net Revenues is recorded in the period in which such determination is made.
COST OF SALES
Cost of sales consists primarily of inventory costs, as well as warehousing costs (including the cost of warehouse labor), third-party royalties, certain foreign currency hedge gains and
losses and product design costs. Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in Cost of sales.
DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE
Demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs, including costs of endorsement contracts, complimentary products, television, digital and print advertising as
well as media costs, brand events and retail brand presentation. Advertising production costs are expensed the first time an advertisement is run. Advertising media costs are
expensed when the advertisement appears. Costs related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs. Costs related to retail brand presentation are expensed when the
presentation is complete and delivered.
A significant amount of the Company's promotional expenses result from payments under endorsement contracts. In general, endorsement payments are expensed on a straight-line
basis over the term of the contract. However, certain contracts contain elements that may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual
contract. Prepayments made under contracts are included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Deferred income taxes and other assets depending on the period to which
the prepayment applies.
Certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sport (e.g., winning a championship). The Company records Demand
creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.
Certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time (e.g., maintaining a specified
ranking in a sport for a year). When the Company determines payments are probable, the amounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based
on the Company's best estimate of the endorser's performance. In these instances, to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from the Company's estimate due to changes
in the endorser's performance, adjustments to Demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period.
Certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products, which the Company records in Cost of sales as the
related sales occur. For contracts containing minimum guaranteed royalty payments, the Company records the amount of any guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through
sales of product within Demand creation expense.
Through cooperative advertising programs, the Company reimburses its wholesale customers for certain costs of advertising the Company's products. To the extent the Company
receives a distinct good or service in exchange for consideration paid to the customer that does not exceed the fair value of that good or service, the amounts reimbursed are recorded
in Demand creation expense.
Total Demand creation expense was $4,285 million, $4,060 million and $3,850 million for the years ended May 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Prepaid advertising and
promotion expenses totaled $814 million and $755 million at May 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of which $420 million and $372 million, respectively, were recorded in Prepaid
expenses and other current assets, and $394 million and $383 million, respectively, were recorded in Deferred income taxes and other assets, depending on the period to which the
prepayment applied.
OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE
Operating overhead expense consists primarily of wage and benefit-related expenses, research and development costs, bad debt expense as well as other administrative expenses
such as rent, depreciation and amortization, professional services, certain technology investments, meetings and travel.

**CASH AND EQUIVALENTS**

Cash and equivalents represent cash and short-term, highly liquid investments, that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturity they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates, with maturities three months or less at the date of purchase.

**SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS**

Short-term investments consist of highly liquid investments with maturities over three months at the date of purchase. At May 31, 2024 and 2023, Short-term investments consisted of available-for-sale debt securities, which are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported, net of tax, in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), unless unrealized losses are determined to be unrecoverable. Realized gains and losses on the sale of securities are determined by specific identification. The Company considers all available-for-sale debt securities, including those with maturity dates beyond 12 months, as available to support current operational liquidity needs and, therefore, classifies all securities with maturity dates beyond three months at the date of purchase as current assets within Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Refer to Note 4 — Fair Value Measurements for more information on the Company's Short-term investments.

**ALLOWANCE FOR UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE**

Accounts receivable, net consist primarily of amounts due from customers. The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for expected losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. In addition to judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations, the Company considers historical levels of credit losses, as well as macroeconomic and industry trends to determine the amount of the allowance. The allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable was $35 million as of May 31, 2024 and 2023.

**INVENTORY VALUATION**

Inventories, substantially all of which are finished goods, are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value and valued on either an average or a specific identification cost basis. In some instances, the Company ships products directly from its suppliers to the customer, with the related inventory and cost of sales recognized on a specific identification basis. Inventory costs primarily consist of product cost from the Company's suppliers, as well as inbound freight, import duties, taxes, insurance, logistics and other handling fees.

**PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION**

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is determined on a straight-line basis for land improvements, buildings and leasehold improvements over 2 to 40 years and for machinery and equipment over 2 to 15 years.

Depreciation and amortization of assets used in manufacturing, warehousing and product distribution are recorded in Cost of sales. Depreciation and amortization of all other assets are recorded in Operating overhead expense.

**SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS**

Expenditures for major software purchases and software developed for internal use are capitalized and amortized over 2 to 12 years on a straight-line basis. The Company's policy provides for the capitalization of external direct costs associated with developing or obtaining internal use computer software. The Company also capitalizes certain payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with internal use computer software projects. The amount of capitalizable payroll costs with respect to these employees is limited to the time directly spent on such projects. Costs associated with preliminary project stage activities, training, maintenance and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as incurred.

Development costs of computer software to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed as an integral part of a product are subject to capitalization beginning when a product's technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release to customers. In most instances, the Company's products are released soon after technological feasibility has been established; therefore, software development costs incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are usually not significant, and generally, most software development costs have been expensed as incurred.

**IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS**
The Company reviews the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of
the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used,
a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among
others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, the Company would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the
sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset
group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, the Company will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate
valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group's carrying
amount and its estimated fair value.

**GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS**
The Company performs annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances
change that would, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value.

For purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, the Company allocates goodwill across its reporting units, which are considered the Company's operating segments. For both goodwill
and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks, the Company may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is
more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life is less than its carrying amount. If, after assessing the totality of events and
circumstances, the Company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount, an
impairment test is unnecessary.

If an impairment test is necessary, the Company will estimate the fair value of the related reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset. If the carrying value of a reporting unit or
indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is determined to be impaired and the Company will record an
impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the related fair value.

There were immaterial impairment losses as of May 31, 2024, and no accumulated impairment losses as of May 31, 2023. Additionally, the impact to Goodwill as a result of
acquisitions and divestitures during fiscal 2024 and 2023, was immaterial.

**OPERATING LEASES**
The Company primarily leases retail store space, certain distribution and warehouse facilities, office space, equipment and other non-real estate assets. The Company determines if an
arrangement is a lease at inception and begins recording lease activity at the commencement date, which is generally the date in which the Company takes possession of or controls
the physical use of the asset. Lease components are not separated from non-lease components for real estate leases within the Company's lease portfolio. Right-of-use ("ROU")
assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term with lease expense recognized on a straight-line basis. The Company's
incremental borrowing rate is used to determine the present value of future lease payments unless the implicit rate is readily determinable.

Lease agreements may contain rent escalation clauses, renewal or termination options, rent holidays or certain landlord incentives, including tenant improvement allowances. ROU
assets include amounts for scheduled rent increases and are reduced by the amount of lease incentives. The lease term includes the non-cancelable period of the lease and options to
extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise those options. The Company does not record leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognizes related lease payments in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain lease
agreements include variable lease payments, which are based on a percent of retail sales over specified levels or adjust periodically for inflation as a result of changes in a published
index, primarily the Consumer Price Index, and are expensed as incurred.

**FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS**
The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including derivatives, equity securities and available-for-sale debt securities. Fair value
is the price the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date. The Company uses a
three-level hierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used, as follows:

2024 FORM 10-K 66


---


# Page 70 of 103

Table of Contents

Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; these include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active
markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs with little or no market data available, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.
The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or
liability. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the most conservative level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
Pricing vendors are utilized for a majority of Level 1 and Level 2 investments. These vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without
applying significant adjustments in their pricing. Observable inputs include broker quotes, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities and credit
risks. The fair value of derivative contracts is determined using observable market inputs such as the daily market foreign currency rates, forward pricing curves, currency volatilities,
currency correlations and interest rates and considers nonperformance risk of the Company and its counterparties.
The Company's fair value measurement process includes comparing fair values to another independent pricing vendor to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded.
Refer to Note 4 Fair Value Measurements for additional information.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS
Adjustments resulting from translating foreign functional currency financial statements into U.S. Dollars are included in the foreign currency translation adjustment, a component of
Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).
The Company's global subsidiaries have various monetary assets and liabilities, primarily receivables and payables, which are denominated in currencies other than their functional
currency. These balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement, the impact of which is recorded in Other (income) expense, net, within the Consolidated Statements of Income.
ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. All derivatives are recorded at fair value
on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are either recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), Long-
term debt or Net income depending on the nature of the underlying exposure, whether the derivative is formally designated as a hedge and, if designated, the extent to which the
hedge is effective. The Company classifies the cash flows at settlement from derivatives in the same category as the cash flows from the related hedged items. For undesignated
hedges and designated cash flow hedges, this is primarily within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For designated net
investment hedges, this is within the Cash provided by investing activities component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. For the Company's fair value hedges, which are
interest rate swaps used to mitigate the change in fair value of its fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates, the related cash flows from periodic interest payments are
reflected within the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Refer to Note 12 - Risk Management and Derivatives for additional information on the Company's risk management program and derivatives.
STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation by estimating the fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, of equity awards and recognizing the related expense as Cost of sales
or Operating overhead expense, as applicable, in the Consolidated Statements of Income on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Substantially all awards vest ratably over
four years of continued employment, with stock options expiring 10 years from the date of grant. Performance-based restricted stock units vest based on the Company's achievement
of certain performance criteria throughout the three-year performance period and continued employment through the vesting date. The fair value of options, stock appreciation rights
and employees' purchase rights under the employee stock purchase plans ("ESPPs") is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of restricted stock and
time-vesting restricted stock units is established by the market price on the date of grant. The fair value of performance-based restricted stock units is estimated as of the grant date
using a Monte Carlo simulation.
Refer to Note 9 Common Stock and Stock-Based Compensation for additional information on the Company's stock-based compensation programs.

INCOME TAXES
The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. This approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax
consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax
assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain.
At least quarterly, the Company assesses taxable income in prior carryback periods, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and available tax
planning strategies. The Company uses forecasts of taxable income and considers foreign tax credit utilization in making this assessment of realization, which are inherently uncertain
and can result in variation between estimated and actual results. To the extent the Company believes that recovery is not likely, a valuation allowance is established against the net
deferred tax asset, which increases the Company's income tax expense in the period when such determination is made.

The Company recognizes a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions in the consolidated financial statements only when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon
examination by relevant tax authorities. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense.

Refer to Note 7 - Income Taxes for further discussion.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing Net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per common
share is calculated by adjusting weighted average outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards.

Refer to Note 10 - Earnings Per Share for further discussion.
RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND DISCLOSURE RULES
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to
Reportable Segment Disclosures, which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant expenses. The
amendments will require public entities to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within segment profit
and loss. The amendments are effective for the Company's annual periods beginning June 1, 2024, and interim periods beginning June 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted, and will
be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the ASU to determine its impact on the Company's
disclosures.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which includes amendments that further enhance income
tax disclosures, primarily through standardization and disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The amendments are effective for the
Company's annual periods beginning June 1, 2025, with early adoption permitted, and should be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating
the ASU to determine its impact on the Company's disclosures.

In March 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") adopted the final rule under SEC Release No. 33-11275, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-
Related Disclosures for Investors. This rule will require registrants to disclose certain climate-related information in registration statements and annual reports. In April 2024, the SEC
voluntarily stayed the final rule as a result of pending legal challenges. The disclosure requirements will apply to the Company's fiscal year beginning June 1, 2025, pending resolution
of the stay. The Company is currently evaluating the final rule to determine its impact on the Company's disclosures.
RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS
In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities — Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations. The new
guidance requires qualitative and quantitative disclosure sufficient to enable users of the financial statements to understand the nature, activity during the period, changes from period
to period and potential magnitude of such programs. The Company adopted the required guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.

Certain financial institutions offer voluntary supplier finance programs facilitated through a third-party platform that provide participating suppliers the option to finance valid payment
obligations from the Company. The Company is not a party to agreements negotiated between participating suppliers and third-party financial institutions. The Company's obligations
to its suppliers, including amounts due and payment terms, are not affected by a supplier's decision to participate in these programs and the Company does not provide guarantees to
third parties in connection with these programs. As of May 31, 2024 and May 31, 2023, the Company had $840 million and $834 million, respectively, of outstanding supplier
obligations confirmed as

As of May 31, 2024, the Company held $1,002 million of available-for-sale debt securities with maturity dates within one year and $20 million with maturity dates over one year and
less than five years in Short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of the Company's available-for-sale debt securities approximates their amortized
cost.

Included in Interest expense (income), net was interest income related to the Company's investment portfolio of $430 million, $297 million and $94 million for the years ended May 31,
2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The Company records the assets and liabilities of its derivative financial instruments on a gross basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company's derivative financial
instruments are subject to master netting arrangements that allow for the offset of assets and liabilities in the event of default or early termination of the contract. Any amounts of cash
collateral received related to these instruments associated with the Company's credit-related contingent features are recorded in Cash and equivalents and Accrued liabilities, the
latter of which would further offset against the Company's derivative asset balance. Any amounts of cash collateral posted related to these instruments associated with the Company's
credit-related contingent features are recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets, which would further offset against the Company's derivative liability balance. Cash
collateral received or posted related to the Company's credit-related contingent features is presented in the Cash provided by operations component of the Consolidated Statements
of Cash Flows. The Company does not recognize amounts of non-cash collateral received, such as securities, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For additional information related
to credit risk, refer to Note 12 — Risk Management and Derivatives.

NOTE 5 - SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND CREDIT LINES
The carrying amounts reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for Notes payable approximate fair value.
On March 11, 2022, the Company entered into a five-year committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to $2 billion of borrowings, with the
option to increase borrowings up to $3 billion in total with lender approval. The facility matures on March 11, 2027, with options to extend the maturity date up to an additional two
years. Based on the Company's current long-term senior unsecured debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively, the
interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("Term SOFR") for the applicable interest period plus 0.60%.
The facility fee is 0.04% of the total undrawn commitment.
On March 8, 2024, the Company entered into a 364-day committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks, which provides for up to $1 billion of borrowings, with an option
to increase borrowings up to $1.5 billion in total with lender approval. The facility matures on March 7, 2025, with an option to extend the maturity date an additional 364 days. This
facility replaces the prior $1 billion 364-day credit facility agreement entered into on March 10, 2023, which matured on March 8, 2024. Based on the Company's current long-term
senior unsecured debt ratings of AA- and A1 from Standard and Poor's Corporation and Moody's Investor Services, respectively, the interest rate charged on any outstanding
borrowings would be the prevailing Term SOFR for the applicable interest period plus 0.60%. The facility fee is 0.02% of the total undrawn commitment.
As of and for the periods ended May 31, 2024 and 2023, no amounts were outstanding under any of the Company's committed credit facilities.

(1) These senior unsecured obligations rank equally with the Company's other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
(2) The bonds are redeemable at the Company's option at a price equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining
scheduled payments, plus in each case, accrued and unpaid interest. However, the bonds also feature a par call provision, which allows for the bonds to be redeemed at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal
amount of the notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest on or after the Par Call Date, which can range from one to six months prior to the scheduled maturity, as defined in the respective notes.
(3) The Company entered into interest rate swap agreements pursuant to which the Company receives fixed interest payments at the same rate as the term debt and pays variable interest payments based on SOFR plus a
fixed spread. At May 31, 2024, the notional amount outstanding of these swaps was $1.8 billion and had interest rates payable that ranged from 4.6% to 5.1%. These swaps mature during fiscal 2034.

The scheduled maturity of Long-term debt in each of the years ending May 31, 2025 through 2029, are $1,000 million, $0 million, $2,000 million, $0 million and $0 million, respectively,
at face value.

The Company's Long-term debt is recorded at adjusted cost, net of unamortized premiums, discounts, and debt issuance costs, and swap fair value adjustments. The fair value of
long-term debt is estimated based upon quoted prices for similar instruments or quoted prices for identical instruments in inactive markets (Level 2). The fair value of the Company's
Long-term debt, including the current portion, was approximately $7,631 million and $7,889 million as of May 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024 was lower than the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2023. The decrease in the Company's effective tax
rate was primarily due to changes in the Company's earning mix and one-time benefits including the impact of temporary relief provided by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS")
relating to U.S. foreign tax credit regulations. On July 21, 2023, the IRS issued Notice 2023-55 which specifically delayed the application of certain U.S. foreign tax credit regulations
that had previously limited the Company's ability to claim credits on certain foreign taxes for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2023. As a result of this new guidance, the Company
recognized a one-time tax benefit related to prior year tax positions in the first three months of fiscal 2024.

The effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2023 was higher than the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to
decreased benefits from stock-based compensation and the recognition of a non-cash, one-time benefit related to the onshoring of the Company's non-U.S. intangible property in fiscal
2022. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company onshored certain non-U.S. intangible property ownership rights and implemented

changes in the Company's legal entity structure. The tax restructuring increases the possibility that foreign earnings in future periods will be subject to tax in the U.S. due to Subpart F
of the Internal Revenue Code. The Company recognized a deferred tax asset and corresponding non-cash deferred income tax benefit of 4.7%, to establish the deferred tax deduction
that is expected to reduce taxable income in future periods.
On August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 that included, among other provisions, changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system,
including a fifteen percent minimum tax based on "adjusted financial statement income," which was effective for the Company beginning June 1, 2023. Based on the Company's
current analysis of the provisions, these tax law changes did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal 2024.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities comprise the following as of:

(1) Of the total $ 2,320 million net deferred tax asset for the period ended May 31, 2024, $ 2,465 million was included within Deferred income taxes and other assets and $(145) million was included within Deferred income
taxes and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Of the total $1,799 million net deferred tax asset for the period ended May 31, 2023, $ 2,026 million was included within Deferred income taxes and other
assets and $(227) million was included within Deferred income taxes and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Deferred tax assets as of May 31, 2024 and 2023, were reduced by a valuation allowance. For the fiscal years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023, a valuation allowance was provided for
U.S. capital loss carryforwards and on tax benefits generated by certain entities with operating losses.

As of May 31, 2024, total gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest and penalties, were $990 million, of which $699 million would affect the Company's effective tax
rate if recognized in future periods. The majority of the total gross unrecognized tax benefits are long-term in nature and included within Deferred income taxes and other liabilities on
the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense. As of May 31, 2024 and 2023, accrued interest and penalties related to
uncertain tax positions were $332 million and $268 million, respectively (excluding federal benefit) and were included within Deferred income taxes and other liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As of May 31, 2024 and 2023, long-term income taxes payable unrelated to unrecognized tax benefits were $266 million and $373 million, respectively, and were included within
Deferred income taxes and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company is subject to taxation in the U.S., as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is currently under audit by the U.S. IRS for fiscal years 2017 through
2019. The Company has closed all U.S. federal income tax matters through fiscal 2016, with the exception of certain transfer pricing adjustments. Tax years after 2011 remain open in
certain major foreign jurisdictions. Although the timing of resolution of audits is not certain, the Company evaluates all domestic and foreign audit issues in the aggregate, along with
the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations, and estimates that it is reasonably possible the total gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $35 million within the
next 12 months.

In January 2019, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether the Netherlands has breached State Aid rules when granting certain tax rulings to the
Company. The Company believes the investigation is without merit. If this matter is adversely resolved, the Netherlands may be required to assess additional amounts with respect to
prior periods, and the Company's income taxes related to prior periods in the Netherlands could increase.

A portion of the Company's foreign operations benefit from a tax holiday, which is set to expire in 2031. This tax holiday may be extended when certain conditions are met or may be
terminated early if certain conditions are not met. The tax benefit attributable to this tax holiday, before taking into consideration other U.S. indirect tax provisions, was $338 million,
$263 million and $221 million for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The benefit of the tax holiday on diluted earnings per common share, before taking
into consideration other U.S. indirect tax provisions, was $0.22, $0.17 and $0.14 for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

**NOTE 8 — REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK**

Sojitz America is the sole owner of the Company's authorized redeemable preferred stock, $1 par value, which is redeemable at the option of Sojitz America or the Company at par
value aggregating $0.3 million. A cumulative dividend of $0.10 per share is payable annually on May 31, and no dividends may be declared or paid on the common stock of the
Company unless dividends on the redeemable preferred stock have been declared and paid in full. There have been no changes in the redeemable preferred stock in the fiscal years
ended May 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. As the holder of the redeemable preferred stock, Sojitz America does not have general voting rights but does have the right to vote as a
separate class on the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries; on merger, consolidation, liquidation or dissolution of the Company; or on the sale
or assignment of the NIKE trademark for athletic footwear sold in the United States. The redeemable preferred stock has been fully issued to Sojitz America and is not blank check

# NOTE 9 — COMMON STOCK AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

## COMMON STOCK
The authorized number of shares of Class A Common Stock, no par value, and Class B Common Stock, no par value, are 400 million and 2,400 million, respectively. Each share of Class A Common Stock is convertible into one share of Class B Common Stock. Voting rights of Class B Common Stock are limited in certain circumstances with respect to the election of directors. There are no differences in the dividend and liquidation preferences or participation rights of the holders of Class A and Class B Common Stock. From time to time, the Company's Board of Directors authorizes share repurchase programs for the repurchase of Class B Common Stock. The value of repurchased shares is deducted from Total shareholders' equity through allocation to Capital in excess of stated value and Retained earnings.

## STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
The NIKE, Inc. Stock Incentive Plan (the "Stock Incentive Plan") provides for the issuance of up to 798 million previously unissued shares of Class B Common Stock in connection with equity awards granted under the Stock Incentive Plan. The Stock Incentive Plan authorizes the grant of non-statutory stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, and stock awards, including restricted stock and restricted stock units. Restricted stock units include both time-vesting restricted stock units ("RSUs") as well as performance-based restricted stock units ("PSUs"). A committee of the Board of Directors administers the Stock Incentive Plan and has the authority to determine the employees to whom awards will be made, the amount of the awards and the other terms and conditions of the awards. The Company generally grants stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units on an annual basis. The exercise price for stock options and stock appreciation rights may not be less than the fair market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant. Substantially all awards under the Stock Incentive Plan vest ratably over 4 years of continued employment, with stock options expiring 10 years from the date of grant.

The following table summarizes the Company's total stock-based compensation expense recognized in Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense, as applicable:

## STOCK OPTIONS
The weighted average fair value per share of stock options granted during the fiscal years ended May 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, computed as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes pricing model, was $32.78, $31.31 and $37.53, respectively. The weighted average assumptions used to estimate these fair values were as follows:

Expected volatilities are based on an analysis of the historical volatility of the Company's common stock, the implied volatility in market traded options on the Company's common stock with a term greater than one year, as well as other factors. The weighted average expected life of options is based on an analysis of historical and expected future exercise patterns. The interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury (constant maturity) risk-free rate in effect at the date of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the options.

# NOTE 12 - RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVES

The Company is exposed to global market risks, including the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, and uses derivatives to manage financial exposures that occur in the normal course of business. The Company does not hold or issue derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.

The Company may elect to designate certain derivatives as hedging instruments under U.S. GAAP. The Company formally documents all relationships between designated hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to either recognized assets or liabilities or forecasted transactions and assessing, both at inception and on an ongoing basis, the effectiveness of the hedging relationships.

The majority of derivatives outstanding as of May 31, 2024, are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges, primarily for Euro/U.S. Dollar, British Pound/Euro, Chinese Yuan/U.S. Dollar and Japanese Yen/U.S. Dollar currency pairs. All derivatives are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classified based on the instrument's maturity date.

The following tables present the fair values of derivative instruments included within the Consolidated Balance Sheets:

CASH FLOW HEDGES
All changes in fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedge instruments are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until Net income is affected by the
variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction. Effective hedge results are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the same manner as the underlying exposure.
When it is no longer probable the forecasted hedged transaction will occur in the initially identified time period, hedge accounting is discontinued and the Company accounts for the
associated derivative as an undesignated instrument as discussed below. Additionally, the gains and losses associated with derivatives no longer designated as cash flow hedge
instruments in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are recognized immediately in Other (income) expense, net, if it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not
occur by the end of the initially identified time period or within an additional two-month period thereafter. In rare circumstances, the additional period of time may exceed two months
due to extenuating circumstances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside the control or influence of the Company.

The purpose of the Company's foreign exchange risk management program is to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on the Company's consolidated
results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Foreign currency exposures the Company may elect to hedge in this manner include product costs, non-functional currency
denominated revenues, intercompany revenues, demand creation expenses, investments in U.S. Dollar denominated available-for-sale debt securities and certain other intercompany
transactions.

Product cost foreign currency exposures are primarily generated through non-functional currency denominated product purchases. NIKE entities primarily purchase product in two
ways: (1) Certain NIKE entities purchase product from the NIKE Trading Company ("NTC"), a wholly-owned sourcing hub that buys NIKE branded products from third-party factories,
predominantly in U.S. Dollars. The NTC, whose functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, then sells the product to NIKE entities in their respective functional currencies. NTC sales to a
NIKE entity with a different functional currency result in a foreign currency

exposure for the NTC. (2) Other NIKE entities purchase product directly from third-party factories in U.S. Dollars. These purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those
NIKE entities with a functional currency other than the U.S. Dollar.

The Company's policy permits the utilization of derivatives to reduce its foreign currency exposures where internal netting or other strategies cannot be effectively employed. Typically,
the Company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100% of the exposure
by the time the forecasted transaction occurs. The total notional amount of outstanding foreign currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was $ 16.2 billion and $18.2
billion as of May 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

As of May 31, 2024, approximately $231 million of deferred net gains (net of tax) on both outstanding and matured derivatives in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are
expected to be reclassified to Net income during the next 12 months concurrent with the underlying hedged transactions also being recorded in Net income. Actual amounts ultimately
reclassified to Net income are dependent on the exchange rates in effect when derivative contracts currently outstanding mature. As of May 31, 2024, the maximum term over which
the Company hedges exposures to the variability of cash flows for its forecasted transactions was 24 months.

**FAIR VALUE HEDGES**

The Company is exposed to the risk of changes in the fair value of certain fixed-rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates. Derivatives used by the Company to hedge this risk
are receive-fixed, pay-variable interest rate swaps which are designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt. Changes in the fair values of the interest rate swaps are
recorded in Long-term debt or Current portion of long-term debt. The total notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges was $1.8 billion as of
May 31, 2024. The Company had no outstanding fair value hedges as of May 31, 2023.

**NET INVESTMENT HEDGES**

The Company has, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge the risk of variability in foreign currency-denominated net investments in wholly-owned international operations.
All changes in fair value of the derivatives designated as net investment hedges are reported in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) along with the foreign currency
translation adjustments on those investments. The Company had no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2024 and 2023.

**UNDESIGNATED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS**

The Company may elect to enter into foreign exchange forwards to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These
undesignated instruments are recorded at fair value as a derivative asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in
Other (income) expense, net, together with the remeasurement gain or loss from the hedged balance sheet position. The total notional amount of outstanding undesignated derivative
instruments was $4.4 billion and $4.7 billion as of May 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

**CREDIT RISK**

The Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to hedging instruments. The counterparties to all derivative transactions are major
financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings; however, this does not eliminate the Company's exposure to credit risk with these institutions. This credit risk is limited to the
unrealized gains in such contracts should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted. To manage this risk, the Company has established strict counterparty credit
guidelines that are continually monitored.

The Company's derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features designed to protect against significant deterioration in counterparties' creditworthiness and their
ultimate ability to settle outstanding derivative contracts in the normal course of business. The Company's bilateral credit-related contingent features generally require the owing entity,
either the Company or the derivative counterparty, to post collateral for the fair value of outstanding derivatives per counterparty. For certain counterparties, collateral would only be
posted for the fair value of outstanding derivatives per counterparty greater than $50 million. Additionally, for those counterparties, a certain level of decline in credit rating of either the
Company or the counterparty could trigger collateral requirements. As of May 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all credit risk-related contingent features. The Company
considers the impact of the risk of counterparty default to be immaterial.

For additional information related to the Company's derivative financial instruments and collateral, refer to Note 4 — Fair Value Measurements.

# NOTE 15 — OPERATING SEGMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION

The Company's operating segments reflect the structure of the Company's internal organization. The NIKE Brand segments are defined by geographic regions for operations participating in NIKE Brand sales activity.

Each NIKE Brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. The Company's reportable operating segments for the NIKE Brand are: North America; Europe, Middle East & Africa ("EMEA"); Greater China; and Asia Pacific & Latin America ("APLA"), and include results for the NIKE and Jordan brands. Refer to Note 18 — Divestitures for information regarding the transition of NIKE Brand businesses in certain countries within APLA to third-party distributors.

The Company's NIKE Direct operations are managed within each NIKE Brand geographic operating segment. Converse is also a reportable segment for the Company and operates in one industry: the design, marketing, licensing and selling of athletic lifestyle sneakers, apparel and accessories.

Global Brand Divisions is included within the NIKE Brand for presentation purposes to align with the way management views the Company. Global Brand Divisions revenues include NIKE Brand licensing and other miscellaneous revenues that are not part of a geographic operating segment. Global Brand Divisions costs represent demand creation and operating overhead expense that include product creation and design expenses centrally managed for the NIKE Brand, as well as costs associated with NIKE Direct global digital operations and enterprise technology.

Corporate consists primarily of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to the Company's headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses.

The primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is earnings before interest and taxes ("EBIT"), which represents Net income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

As part of the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in the Company's geographic operating segments and to Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons, and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases in the entity's functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.

Accounts receivable, net, Inventories and Property, plant and equipment, net for operating segments are regularly reviewed by management and are therefore provided below.

NOTE 16

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
As of May 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had bank guarantees and letters of credit outstanding totaling $68 million and $588 million, respectively, issued primarily for real estate
agreements, self-insurance programs, other general business obligations and legal matters.
In connection with various contracts and agreements, the Company provides routine indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights, coverage for legal
issues that arise and other items where the Company is acting as the guarantor. Currently, the Company has several such agreements in place. However, based on the Company's
historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, the Company has determined the fair value of such indemnification is not material to the Company's financial position
or results of operations.
In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to various legal proceedings, claims and government investigations relating to its business, products and actions of its
employees and representatives, including contractual and employment relationships, product liability, antitrust, customs, tax, intellectual property and other matters. The outcome of
these legal matters is inherently uncertain, and the Company cannot predict the eventual outcome of currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual
losses, fines, penalties or consequences relating to those matters. When a loss related to a legal proceeding or claim is probable and reasonably estimable, the Company accrues its
best estimate for the ultimate resolution of the matter. If one or more legal matters were to be resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above management's
expectations, the Company's financial position, operating results and cash flows for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the opinion of management, based
on its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel, the Company does not believe any currently pending legal matters will have a material adverse impact on the Company's
results of operations, financial position or cash flows, except as described below.
BELGIAN CUSTOMS CLAIM
The Company has received claims for certain years from Belgian Customs and other government authorities for alleged underpaid duties related to products imported beginning in
fiscal 2018. The Company disputes these claims and has engaged in the appellate process. The Company has issued bank guarantees in order to appeal the claims. At this time, the
Company is unable to estimate the range of loss and cannot predict the final outcome as it could take several years to reach a resolution on this matter. If this matter is ultimately
resolved against the Company, the amounts owed, including fines, penalties and other consequences relating to the matter, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
NOTE 17

LEASES
Lease expense is recognized in Cost of sales or Operating overhead expense within the Consolidated Statements of Income, based on the underlying nature of the leased asset. For
the fiscal years ended May 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, lease expense primarily consisted of operating lease costs of $618 million, $585 million and $593 million, respectively, as well as
$433 million, $403 million and $366 million, respectively, primarily related to variable lease costs. As of and for the fiscal years ended May 31, 2024 and 2023 and 2022, finance leases
were not a material component of the Company's lease portfolio.
The undiscounted cash flows for future maturities of the Company's operating lease liabilities and the reconciliation to the Operating lease liabilities recognized in the Company's

**NOTE 18 — DIVESTITURES**

During the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the sale of the Company's entities in Argentina and Uruguay to a third-party distributor was completed and the net loss on the sale of these entities totaled approximately $550 million. This loss included $389 million, recognized primarily in fiscal 2020, largely due to the anticipated release of the cumulative foreign currency translation losses. The remaining loss recognized in fiscal 2023 was due to the devaluation of local currency and cash equivalents included in the transferred assets. Upon completion of the sale, the foreign currency translation losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) were reclassified to Net income within Other (income) expense, net, on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income along with the allowance for previously recognized losses recorded in Accrued liabilities. The net loss was classified within Corporate.

The net cash proceeds received are reflected within Other investing activities on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

NOTE 19 - RESTRUCTURING
During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company announced a multi-year enterprise initiative designed to accelerate its future growth. As part of this initiative, management has
taken steps to streamline the organization which resulted in a net reduction in the Company's global workforce. As of May 31, 2024, the Company expects to recognize pre-tax
restructuring charges of approximately $450 million, primarily associated with employee severance costs and accelerated stock-based compensation expense, the majority of which
were recognized in fiscal 2024. The related cash payments are expected to be substantially complete by the end of the first half of fiscal 2025. The expected pre-tax charges are
estimates and are subject to a number of assumptions and actual results may vary from the estimates provided.
Pre-tax restructuring charges were classified within Corporate as follows:
