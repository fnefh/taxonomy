      In fiscal year 2024, Replimune reported significant clinical progress
      with its RP1 program, including positive data from the IGNYTE trial
      showing a 31.4% overall response rate in anti-PD-1 failed melanoma
      patients. The company plans to submit a BLA in the second half of 2024.
      The ARTACUS trial demonstrated a 34.8% overall response rate in organ
      transplant recipients with skin cancers. However, the CERPASS trial in
      CSCC did not meet its primary endpoints, though showing improved complete
      response rates in locally advanced disease.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: >
          What were the key clinical developments for Replimune's RP1 program in
          fiscal 2024?
        answer: >
          In fiscal 2024, Replimune achieved several key milestones with RP1: a
          31.4% overall response rate in anti-PD-1 failed melanoma patients in
          the IGNYTE trial leading to planned BLA submission, a 34.8% response
          rate in the ARTACUS trial for organ transplant recipients, while the
          CERPASS trial showed improved complete response rates in locally
          advanced CSCC despite not meeting primary endpoints.
      - question: >
          How did the results from different clinical trials demonstrate RP1's
          potential across various indications?
        answer: >
          The results demonstrated RP1's diverse potential: strong efficacy in
          anti-PD-1 failed melanoma (31.4% ORR), promising activity in
          immunosuppressed transplant patients (34.8% ORR), and improved
          complete response rates in locally advanced CSCC, showing activity
          across multiple skin cancer types and patient populations.
      - question: >
          What are the near-term regulatory and clinical implications of these
          results?
        answer: >
          The results support a planned BLA submission for RP1 in anti-PD-1 failed
          melanoma in second half of 2024, continued enrollment in the ARTACUS
          trial for transplant patients, and further evaluation of complete
          response benefits in locally advanced CSCC, positioning multiple
          potential regulatory pathways.
  - context: >
      In fiscal year 2024, Replimune advanced its RP2 program, particularly
      in uveal melanoma where it showed a 29.4% overall response rate in heavily
      pretreated patients, including responses in those with liver, lung, and
      bone metastases. The company is finalizing a registrational trial protocol
      for RP2 in uveal melanoma and plans to initiate a Phase 2 trial in HCC in
      the second half of 2024, while discontinuing development in head and neck
      cancer and colorectal cancer.

          RP2 showed significant progress in uveal melanoma with a 29.4% overall
          response rate in heavily pretreated patients, including responses
          across multiple metastatic sites. The company is finalizing a
          registrational trial protocol and expanding into HCC while focusing
          resources by discontinuing certain indications.
      - question: >
          How does the data from the uveal melanoma program support RP2's

          difficult-to-treat cancer with a 29.4% response rate, including in
          patients who failed prior immunotherapies, supporting the advancement
          toward a registrational trial and establishing RP2's potential in rare
          cancers.
