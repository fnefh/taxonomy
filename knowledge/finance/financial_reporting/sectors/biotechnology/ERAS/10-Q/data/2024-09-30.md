<p>Erasca, Inc. Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements</p>
<p>(Unaudited)</p>
<h2>Note 1. Organization and basis of presentation</h2>
<h2>Organization and nature of operations</h2>
<p>Erasca, Inc. (Erasca or the Company) is a clinical-stage precision oncology company singularly focused on discovering, developing, and commercializing therapies for RAS/MAPK pathway-driven cancers. The Company has assembled a wholly-owned or controlled RAS/MAPK pathway-focused pipeline comprising modality-agnostic programs aligned with its three therapeutic strategies of: (1) targeting key upstream and downstream signaling nodes in the RAS/MAPK pathway; (2) targeting RAS directly; and (3) targeting escape routes that emerge in response to treatment. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 2, 2018, as Erasca, Inc., and is headquartered in San Diego, California. In September 2020, the Company established a wholly-owned Australian subsidiary, Erasca Australia Pty Ltd (Erasca Australia), in order to conduct clinical activities in Australia for its development candidates. In November 2020, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Asana BioSciences, LLC (Asana) and ASN Product Development, Inc. (ASN) (the Asana Merger Agreement), pursuant to which ASN became the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary. In March 2021, the Company established a wholly-owned subsidiary, Erasca Ventures, LLC (Erasca Ventures), to make equity investments in early-stage biotechnology companies that are aligned with the Company's mission and strategy.</p>
<p>Since inception, the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts and resources to organizing and staffing the Company, business planning, raising capital, identifying, acquiring and in-licensing the Company's product candidates, establishing its intellectual property portfolio, conducting research, preclinical studies, and clinical trials, establishing arrangements with third parties for the manufacture of its product candidates and related raw materials, and providing general and administrative support for these operations. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had $318.9 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term marketable securities and $144.4 million in long-term marketable securities. As of September 30, 2024, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $735.4 million. The Company has incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows from operations. From its inception through September 30, 2024, the Company's financial support has primarily been provided from the sale of its convertible preferred stock and the sale of its common stock in its initial public offering (IPO), underwritten offerings, a private placement of common stock, and an "at the market" offering (ATM Offering).</p>
<p>The Company expects to use its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities to fund research and development, working capital, and other general corporate purposes. The Company does not expect to generate any revenues from product sales unless and until the Company successfully completes development and obtains regulatory approval for any of its product candidates, which will not be for at least the next several years, if ever. Accordingly, until such time as the Company can generate significant revenue from sales of its product candidates, if ever, the Company expects to finance its cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings, or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses or other similar arrangements. However, the Company may not be able to secure additional financing or enter into such other arrangements in a timely manner or on favorable terms, if at all. The Company's failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed would have a negative impact on the Company's financial condition and could force the Company to delay, limit, reduce or terminate its research and development programs or other operations, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that the Company would otherwise prefer to develop and market itself. The Company believes its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient for the Company to fund operations for at least one year from the issuance date of these condensed consolidated financial statements.</p>
<h2>2024 ATM offering</h2>
<p>During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company sold 9,231,114 shares of common stock at a weighted-average price of $2.37 per share under the Open Market Sale Agreement effective August 2022 (the Sale Agreement) with Jefferies LLC (the Agent). Pursuant to the Sale Agreement, the Company may offer and sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $200 million from time to time, in ATM Offerings through the Agent. Sales of the shares of common stock, if any, will be made at prevailing market prices at the time of sale, or as otherwise agreed with the Agent. Pursuant to the Sale Agreement, the Agent receives a commission from the Company of up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds of any shares of common stock sold under the Sale Agreement. Proceeds from the ATM Offering during the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $21.0 million, net of commissions and expenses of $847,000.</p>
<h2>2024 underwritten offering</h2>
<p>In May 2024, the Company completed the sale and issuance of 99,459,458 shares of its common stock, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 12,972,972 shares of its common stock, at a price to the public of $1.85 per share (the 2024 Offering). Proceeds from the 2024 Offering were $174.4 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs of $9.6 million.</p>
<h2>2024 private placement</h2>
<p>In March 2024, the Company entered into a stock purchase agreement with the purchasers named therein for the private placement of 21,844,660 shares of its common stock at a price of $2.06 per share, which closed on April 2, 2024 (the 2024 Private Placement). Proceeds from the 2024 Private Placement were $43.6 million, after deducting placement agent fees and expenses of approximately $1.4 million.</p>
<h2>Basis of presentation</h2>
<p>The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP) for interim financial information and pursuant to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by US GAAP for complete financial statements. Any reference in these notes to applicable guidance is meant to refer to US GAAP as found in the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) and Accounting Standards Updates (ASU) promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The Company's condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Erasca Australia, ASN, and Erasca Ventures. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.</p>
<h2>Note 2. Summary of significant accounting policies</h2>
<h2>Use of estimates</h2>
<p>The preparation of the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that impact the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Accounting estimates and management judgments reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, the accrual of research and development expenses, stock-based compensation expense, the fair value of long-lived assets, the fair value of equity investments and the incremental borrowing rate for determining the operating lease asset and liability. Management evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis. Although estimates are based on the Company's historical experience, knowledge of current events, and actions it may undertake in the future, actual results may ultimately materially differ from these estimates and assumptions.</p>
<h2>Unaudited interim financial information</h2>
<p>The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2024, the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the condensed consolidated statements of stockholders' equity for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are unaudited. The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of the Company's condensed consolidated financial position as of September 30, 2024 and the condensed consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The condensed consolidated financial data and other information disclosed in these notes related to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023 are unaudited. The condensed consolidated results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024, any other interim periods, or any future year or period. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 27, 2024.</p>
<h2>Concentration of credit risk and off-balance sheet risk</h2>
<p>Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to significant concentration of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. The Company maintains deposits in federally insured financial institutions in excess of federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts, and management believes that the Company is not exposed to significant credit risk due to the financial position of the depository institutions in which those deposits are held. The Company's investment policy includes guidelines for the quality of the related institutions and financial instruments and defines allowable investments that the Company may invest in, which the Company believes minimizes the exposure to concentration of credit risk.</p>
<h2>Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash</h2>
<p>Cash and cash equivalents include cash in readily available checking and savings accounts and money market funds. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.</p>
<p>The Company had deposited cash of $408,000 as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 to secure a letter of credit in connection with the lease of the Company's facilities (see Note 10). The Company has classified the restricted cash as a noncurrent asset on its condensed consolidated balance sheets.</p>
<p>The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the condensed consolidated balance sheets that sum to the total of the same amounts shown in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):</p>

<h2>Marketable securities and investments</h2>
<p>The Company classifies all marketable securities as available-for-sale, as the sale of such securities may be required prior to maturity. Management determines the appropriate classification of its marketable securities at the time of purchase. Marketable securities with original maturities beyond three months at the date of purchase and which mature at, or less than 12 months from, the balance sheet date are classified as short-term marketable securities. Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses reported as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) until realized. The amortized cost of available-for-sale debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization and accretion are included in interest income. The Company regularly reviews all of its marketable securities for declines in fair value. The review includes the consideration of the cause of the impairment, including the creditworthiness of the security issuers, the number of securities in an unrealized loss position, the severity of the unrealized loss(es), whether the Company has the intent to sell the securities and whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities before the recovery of their amortized cost basis. If the decline in fair value is due to credit-related factors, a loss is recognized in net income; whereas, if the decline in fair value is not due to credit-related factors, the loss is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in other income or expense. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are included in interest income.</p>
<p>Through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Erasca Ventures, the Company has also invested in equity securities of a company whose securities are not publicly traded and whose fair value is not readily available (see Notes 3 and 14). This investment is recorded using cost minus impairment, plus or minus changes in its estimated fair value resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are assessed for potential impairment on a quarterly basis based on qualitative factors. This investment is included in other assets in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheets.</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<h2>Fair value measurements</h2>
<p>Certain assets and liabilities are carried at fair value under US GAAP. Fair value is defined as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy, of which the first two are considered observable and the last is considered unobservable:</p>
<p>Level 1-Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.</p>
<p>Level 2-Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.</p>
<p>Level 3-Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).</p>
<h2>Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted</h2>
<p>From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies that the Company adopts as of the specified effective date. The Company qualifies as an "emerging growth company" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (JOBS Act) and has elected not to "opt out" of the extended transition related to complying with new or revised accounting standards, which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public and nonpublic companies, the Company can adopt the new or revised standard at the time nonpublic companies adopt the new or revised standard and can do so until such time that the Company either (i) irrevocably elects to "opt out" of such extended transition period or (ii) no longer qualifies as an emerging growth company.</p>
<p>In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which is intended to provide enhancements to segment disclosures, even for entities with only one reportable segment. In particular, the standard will require disclosures of significant segment expenses regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit and loss. The standard will also require disclosure of all other segment items by reportable segment and a description of its composition. Finally, the standard will require disclosure of the title and position of the chief operating decision maker and an explanation of how the chief operating decision maker uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. Retrospective application to all prior periods presented in the financial statements is required. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on the presentation of its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.</p>
<p>In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which is intended to provide enhancements to annual income tax disclosures. In particular, the standard will require more detailed information in the income tax rate reconciliation, as well as the disclosure of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction, among other enhancements. The standard is effective for the Company in its annual period beginning after December 15, 2025 and early adoption is permitted. The standard allows for adoption on a prospective basis, with a retrospective option. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on the presentation of its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.</p>
<p>In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which is intended to improve the disclosures of expenses by providing more detailed information about the types of expenses in commonly presented expense captions. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The standard can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the standard on the presentation of its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.</p>

<p>The carrying amounts of the Company's financial instruments, including cash, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities, approximate fair value due to their short maturities. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company held $1.8 million and $2.0 million in equity investments in Affini-T Therapeutics, Inc. (Affini-T) at cost, less impairment, respectively. An impairment adjustment of $402,000 was made to the value of the Company's equity investment in Affini-T during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The Company was notified by Affini-T of an extension financing in June 2024 and the terms of such financing. Accordingly, the Company reassessed the value of its equity investment in Affini-T using a market approach. This represented a Level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurement. Calculating the fair value of the equity investment involves unobservable inputs, including the terms and preferences of the extension financing, and significant estimates and assumptions. Changes in the estimates and assumptions used could materially affect the amount of impairment loss recognized in the period the equity investment is considered impaired. This impairment was offset by a new investment obligation of approximately $235,000 recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. In July 2024, the Company paid approximately $157,000 of the obligation related to the extension financing. No adjustment was made to the value of the Company's equity investment in Affini-T during the three months ended September 30, 2024. No transfers between levels have occurred during the periods presented.</p>
<p>Cash equivalents consist of money market funds and commercial paper, short-term marketable securities consist of US treasury securities, US government agency securities, corporate debt securities and commercial paper, and long-term marketable securities consist of US treasury securities and US government agency securities. The Company obtains pricing information from its investment manager and generally determines the fair value of marketable securities using standard observable inputs, including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, and bid and/or offers.</p>

<p>As of September 30, 2024, there were seven available-for-sale securities with an estimated fair value of $44.8 million in gross unrealized loss positions, of which three available-for-sale securities with an estimated fair value of $15.0 million were in an unrealized loss position for more than 12 months. As of December 31, 2023, there were 22 available-for-sale securities with an estimated fair value of $105.6 million in gross unrealized loss positions, none of which were in an unrealized loss position for more than 12 months.</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities are not attributed to credit risk. The Company believes that an allowance for credit losses is unnecessary because the unrealized losses on certain of the Company's available-for-sale securities are due to market factors and changes in interest rates. Additionally, the Company does not intend to sell the securities nor is it more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis.</p>
<p>Accrued interest on the Company's available-for-sale securities was $2.4 million and $1.1 million as of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, and was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.</p>

<h2>Note 7. Asset acquisitions</h2>
<p>The following purchased assets were accounted for as asset acquisitions as substantially all of the fair value of the assets acquired were concentrated in a group of similar assets, and the acquired assets did not have outputs or employees. Because the assets had not yet received regulatory approval, the fair value attributable to these assets was recorded as in-process research and development expenses in the Company's condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.</p>

<h2>Note 9. Stock-based compensation</h2>
<p>In July 2021, the Company's board of directors adopted and the Company's stockholders approved the Company's 2021 Incentive Award Plan (the 2021 Plan), which became effective in connection with the IPO. Upon the adoption of the 2021 Plan, the Company ceased making equity grants under its 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2018 Plan). Under the 2021 Plan, the Company may grant stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, and other stock or cash-based awards to individuals who are then employees, officers, directors or non-entity consultants of the Company. A total of 15,150,000 shares of common stock were initially reserved for issuance under the 2021 Plan. In addition, the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the 2021 Plan may be increased annually on the first day of each calendar year during the term of the 2021 Plan, beginning in 2022, by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 5% of the shares of common stock outstanding on the final day of the immediately preceding calendar year or (ii) such smaller number of shares as determined by the Company's board of directors or an authorized committee of the board of directors. As of September 30, 2024, there were 12,912,223 stock-based awards available for future grant under the 2021 Plan.</p>
<p>Subsequent to July 2021, no further awards will be granted under the 2018 Plan and all future stock-based awards will be granted under the 2021 Plan. To the extent outstanding options or restricted stock granted under the 2018 Plan are cancelled, forfeited, repurchased, or otherwise terminated without being exercised or becoming vested, and would otherwise have been returned to the share reserve under the 2018 Plan, the number of shares underlying such awards will be available for future grant under the 2021 Plan.</p>
<p>Options granted are exercisable at various dates as determined upon grant and will expire no more than ten years from their date of grant. Stock options generally vest over a four-year term. The exercise price of each option shall be determined by the Company's board of directors based on the estimated fair value of the Company's stock on the date of the option grant. The exercise price shall not be less than 100% of the fair market value of the Company's common stock at the time the option is granted. For holders of more than 10% of the Company's total combined voting power of all classes of stock, incentive stock options may not be granted at less than 110% of the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant and for a term that exceeds five years. Early exercise was permitted for certain grants under the 2018 Plan.</p>

<p>The weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $1.86 and $1.29, respectively, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $1.99 and $2.74, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock option grants was $41.9 million and is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately 2.53 years. The intrinsic value of the options exercised for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 was $535,000 and $705,000, respectively. The intrinsic value of the options exercised for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 was $21,000 and $914,000, respectively.</p>
<p>Prior to the Company's IPO, certain individuals were granted the ability to early exercise their stock options. The shares of common stock issued from the early exercise of unvested stock options are restricted and continue to vest in accordance with the original vesting schedule. The Company has the option to repurchase any unvested shares at the original purchase price upon any voluntary or involuntary termination. The shares purchased by the employees and non-employees pursuant to the early exercise of stock options are not deemed, for accounting purposes, to be outstanding until those shares vest. The cash received in exchange for exercised and unvested shares related to stock options granted is recorded as a liability for the early exercise of stock options on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets and will be transferred into common stock and additional paid-in capital as the shares vest. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were zero shares and 371,876 shares subject to repurchase by the Company, respectively. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company recorded $0 and $464,000 of liabilities associated with shares issued with repurchase rights, respectively, which is recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities.</p>

<p>Effective May 21, 2024, and in accordance with the terms of the 2021 Plan, the Company's board of directors approved a stock option repricing (the Option Repricing) whereby the exercise price of each Repriced Option (as defined below) was reduced to $2.35 per share, the closing stock price on May 21, 2024. For purposes of the Option Repricing, "Repriced Options" are 7,478,918 outstanding stock options as of May 21, 2024 (vested and unvested) granted under the 2021 Plan and held by those eligible employees of the Company identified by the Company's board of directors, excluding the Company's Section 16 officers (the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Business Officer, the Chief Medical Officer, and the General Counsel) and the Company's board of directors.</p>
<p>To the extent a Repriced Option is exercised prior to the Premium End Date (as defined below), the eligible employee will be required to pay the original exercise price per share of the Repriced Options in connection with any exercise of the Repriced Option. The "Premium End Date" means the earliest of (i) May 21, 2026; (ii) the date of a change in control of the Company; (iii) the date of the eligible employee's death or disability; or (iv) the date of the eligible employee's termination without cause, provided that such termination without cause occurs after May 21, 2025. Except for the reduction in the exercise prices of the Repriced Options as described above, the Repriced Options will retain their existing terms and conditions as set forth in the 2021 Plan and the applicable award agreements. All repriced options will retain their original vesting schedule.</p>
<p>The Option Repricing resulted in $1.1 million of incremental cost, which was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, of which $559,000 of the incremental cost will be recognized on a straight-line basis through the Premium End Date, and $558,000 of the incremental cost will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the greater of the period through the Premium End Date or the remaining service period. The incremental cost is included in general and administrative expense and research and development expense on the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.</p>

The purchase price of the shares will be 85% of the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the first day of trading of the applicable offering period or on the applicable purchase date, whichever is lower. A total of 1,260,000 shares of common stock was initially reserved for issuance under the ESPP. In addition, the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the ESPP may be increased annually on the first day of each calendar year during the term of the ESPP, beginning in 2022, by an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 1% of the shares of common stock outstanding on the final day of the immediately preceding calendar year or (ii) such smaller number of shares as determined by the Company's board of directors or an authorized committee of the board of directors. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP of $156,000 and $600,000 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and $198,000 and $1.3 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, the unrecognized compensation cost related to the ESPP was $891,000 and is expected to be recognized as expense over approximately 1.22 years. As of September 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $305,000 and $46,000 has been withheld on behalf of employees for future purchase under the ESPP, respectively, and is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company issued and sold zero and 252,444 shares under the ESPP during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively, and zero and 223,696 shares under the ESPP during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively.</p>
<p>The assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the stock to be purchased under the ESPP were as follows:</p>

<h2>Note 10. Leases</h2>
<h2>Operating leases</h2>
<p>The Company has facility leases for office space under non-cancellable and cancellable operating leases with various expiration dates through 2032 and equipment under a non-cancellable operating lease with a term expiring in 2026. Total lease costs were approximately $2.4 million and $8.4 million, including operating lease costs of $1.8 million and $6.2 million, variable lease costs of $940,000 and $2.8 million, and sublease income of $361,000 and $577,000, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively. Total lease costs were approximately $2.8 million and $8.6 million, including operating lease costs of $1.9 million and $5.7 million and variable lease costs of $859,000 and $2.9 million, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The Company paid $6.1 million and $4.7 million in cash for operating leases, net of cash received from subleases, that is included in the operating activities section of the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.</p>
<p>The weighted-average remaining lease term and the weighted-average discount rate of the Company's operating leases were 7.57 years and 8.96%, respectively, at September 30, 2024. The weighted-average remaining lease term and the weighted-average discount rate of the Company's operating leases were 8.29 years and 8.95%, respectively, at December 31, 2023. The weighted-average remaining lease term does not include any renewal options at the election of the Company.</p>
<p>The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.</p>
<h2>Facility leases</h2>
<p>In September 2020, the Company entered into a lease agreement for 59,407 square feet of laboratory and office space in San Diego, California, which represented a portion of a new facility that was under construction and which was subsequently amended in March 2021 to expand the rented premises by 18,421 square feet (the 2020 Lease). The construction and design of the asset was the primary responsibility of the lessor. The Company was involved in certain aspects of construction and design for certain interior features and leasehold improvements that is beneficial to the Company to better suit its business needs and intended purpose of the space. The lease is accounted for as an operating lease and commenced in August 2021. In April 2022, the 2020 Lease was modified to amend the rent commencement date from February 2022 to May 2022. The 2020 Lease, as amended, has a term of 10.75 years and includes aggregate monthly payments to the lessor of approximately $51.6 million beginning in May 2023 with a rent escalation clause, and a tenant improvement allowance of approximately $16.8 million. The Company is responsible for its share of operating expenses based on actual operating expenses incurred by the landlord. The 2020 Lease is cancellable at the Company's request after the 84th month with 12 months written notice and a lump-sum cancellation payment of $2.5 million. The termination option has not been included in the Company's operating lease assets and liabilities. As discussed in Note 2, the Company provided a letter of credit to the lessor for $408,000, which expires July 29, 2032.</p>
<p>In December 2021, the Company entered into a lease agreement for 29,542 square feet of office and laboratory space in South San Francisco, California. The lease is accounted for as an operating lease with the associated operating lease assets and liabilities recorded upon commencement, which occurred in July 2022. The non-cancellable operating lease has an initial term of 124 months with an option to extend the lease term by 5 years at the then-current market rates and includes aggregate monthly payments to the lessor of approximately $34.4 million beginning in November 2022 with a rent escalation clause and a tenant improvement allowance of approximately $8.2 million. The renewal option has not been included in the Company's operating lease assets and liabilities. The Company is responsible for its share of operating expenses based on actual operating expenses incurred by the landlord. The construction and design of the tenant improvements was the primary responsibility of the lessor. While the Company was involved in certain aspects of construction and design for certain interior features and leasehold improvements that is beneficial to the Company to better suit its business needs and intended purpose of the space, all construction was handled directly by the landlord. The Company was not deemed to be the accounting owner of the tenant improvements prior to or after the construction period. All payments made by the Company for landlord-owned tenant improvements were recorded as prepaid rent on the condensed consolidated balance sheets prior to lease commencement and included in the operating lease asset upon lease commencement. In February 2022, the expected project costs exceeded the tenant improvement allowances by $5.1 million, which was paid directly to the landlord by the Company and was recorded as prepaid rent in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and as a cash outflow from operating activities in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. Upon lease commencement, the $5.1 million of prepaid rent was included in the operating lease asset. The Company paid a security deposit of $874,000 in December 2021 that was recorded as other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.</p>
<p>In January 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sublease the second floor of its corporate headquarters in San Diego, California. Pursuant to the agreement, the subleased space is approximately 10,000 square feet of office space with a sublease term of three years which includes an option for the subtenant to renew for an additional year and an early termination clause. In July 2024, the Company executed an agreement to sublease the first floor of its corporate headquarters. Pursuant to the agreement, the subleased space is approximately 18,421 square feet of office space with a sublease term of 61 months beginning in October 2024, and early access in August 2024. The agreement includes an option for the subtenant to renew for an additional year and an early termination clause. In September 2024, the Company entered into an agreement to sublease a portion of the third floor of its corporate headquarters in San Diego, California. Pursuant to the agreement, the subleased space is approximately 5,000 square feet of laboratory space with a sublease term of one year which includes an option for the subtenant to renew for an additional year.</p>
<p>The Company determined the subleases to be operating leases. Therefore, the Company recognizes sublease income on a straight-line basis over the lease term in its condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss as a reduction to operating lease costs because the subleases are outside of the Company's normal business operations. The Company will continue to account for the operating lease assets and related liabilities of the original lease as it did prior to the commencement of the subleases. The Company recorded a reduction to operating lease costs of $361,000 and $577,000 related to income from these subleases during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024, respectively.</p>
<p>In connection with committing to the plan to sublease the first floor in June 2024, the Company reassessed its asset groups for testing long-lived assets for impairment and determined the first floor operating lease assets and related property and equipment represented an asset group separate from the entity wide asset group. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the first floor asset group was not recoverable as it exceeded the future net undiscounted cash flows that are expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the assets within the asset group. The Company determined the fair value of the first floor asset group based on the income approach using a discounted cash flow model. The cash flows used in the model were discounted using a rate of 13.5%. Based on this analysis, the Company recognized a noncash impairment charge of $4.7 million, including $2.4 million for the operating lease assets and $2.3 million for the leasehold improvements and furniture, of which $3.0 million was recorded to research and development expense and $1.7 million was recorded to general and administrative expense, during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. No impairment was recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2024. This represented a Level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurement. Calculating the fair value of the asset group involves significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows and a discount rate. Changes in the estimates and assumptions used could materially affect the amount of impairment loss recognized in the period the asset group is considered impaired.</p>

<h2>Note 11. Commitments and contingencies</h2>
<p>Liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation, fines, penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. There are no matters currently outstanding for which any such liabilities have been accrued.</p>
<h2>Strategic reprioritization</h2>
<p>In May 2024, in connection with the execution of the Joyo License Agreement and the Medshine License Agreement, the Company approved a strategic reprioritization to focus the Company's resources on its naporafenib program, its ERAS-0015 product candidate, which is the lead candidate from the Joyo License Agreement, and its ERAS-4001 product candidate, which is the lead candidate from the Medshine License Agreement. The Company deprioritized its HERKULES-3 clinical trial evaluating ERAS-007 in combination with encorafenib and cetuximab (EC) in patients with EC-naïve BRAFm colorectal cancer, its THUNDERBBOLT-1 clinical trial evaluating ERAS-801 in patients with recurrent glioblastoma, and its ERAS-4 pan-KRAS program. The Company will explore further advancement of the ERAS-801 program, including via partnerships and select investigator-sponsored trials, and certain of the existing ERAS-4 molecules may serve as backup compounds for ERAS-4001. In connection with this strategic reprioritization, the Company also approved a reduction in the Company's workforce by approximately 18%, primarily affecting employees working in certain drug discovery functions or on the deprioritized programs and trials. As a result, the Company recognized $0 and $2.2 million in total charges in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss based upon the underlying employees' role within the Company in connection with the reduction in force. These charges consisted primarily of one-time cash charges for termination benefits which were substantially all paid in June 2024.</p>
<h2>Note 12. Income taxes</h2>
<p>No provision for federal, state or foreign income taxes has been recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company has incurred net operating losses for all the periods presented and has not reflected any benefit of such net operating loss carryforwards in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements due to uncertainty around utilizing these tax attributes within their respective carryforward periods. The Company has recorded a full valuation allowance against all of its deferred tax assets as it is not more likely than not that such assets will be realized in the near future. The Company's policy is to recognize interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters as tax expense. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company has not recognized any interest or penalties related to income taxes.</p>

<p>The Company's potentially dilutive securities, which include options to purchase common stock, shares purchasable under the ESPP and common stock subject to repurchase related to options early exercised, have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share as the effect would be to reduce the net loss per share. Therefore, the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding used to calculate both basic and diluted net loss per share is the same. The Company excluded the following potential common shares, presented as amounts outstanding at each period end, from the computation of diluted net loss per share for the periods indicated because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect:</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>We are a clinical-stage precision oncology company singularly focused on discovering, developing, and commercializing therapies for patients with RAS/MAPK pathway-driven cancers. Molecular alterations in RAS, the most frequently mutated oncogene, and the MAPK pathway, one of the most frequently altered signaling pathways in cancer, account for approximately 5.4 million new patients diagnosed with cancer globally each year. Our company was co-founded by leading pioneers in precision oncology and RAS targeting to create novel therapies and combination regimens designed to comprehensively shut down the RAS/MAPK pathway for the treatment of patients with cancer. We have assembled one of the deepest, wholly-owned or controlled RAS/MAPK pathway-focused pipelines in the industry, which comprises modality-agnostic programs aligned with our three therapeutic strategies of: (1) targeting key upstream and downstream signaling nodes in the RAS/MAPK pathway; (2) targeting RAS directly; and (3) targeting escape routes that emerge in response to treatment.</p>
<p>The following figure shows the RAS/MAPK pathway and how the three therapeutic strategies listed above attempt to comprehensively and synergistically shut down the RAS/MAPK pathway.</p>
<p>img199616404_0.jpg</p>
<p>The target breadth and molecular diversity represented in our pipeline enable us to pursue a systematic, data-driven, portfolio-wide clinical development effort to identify single agent and combination approaches with the goal of prolonging survival in numerous patient populations with high unmet medical needs. Our modality-agnostic approach aims to allow us to selectively and potently target critical signaling nodes with the most appropriate modality, including small molecule therapeutics and large molecule therapeutics. Our purpose-built pipeline consists of several molecules targeting key oncogenic drivers, including: one clinical-stage program (a pan-RAF inhibitor), two IND-enabling stage programs (a pan-RAS molecular glue and a pan-KRAS inhibitor), and an additional discovery-stage program. We believe our world-class team's capabilities and experience, further guided by our scientific advisory board, which includes the world's leading experts in the RAS/MAPK pathway, uniquely position us to achieve our bold mission of erasing cancer.</p>
<p>Our lead product candidate is naporafenib, a pan-RAF inhibitor with first-in-class and best-in-class potential for patients with NRASm melanoma and other RAS/MAPK pathway-driven tumors. RAF proteins are ubiquitously expressed serine-threonine kinases that constitute a key node of the RAS/MAPK pathway downstream of RAS and upstream of MEK. The RAF protein family consists of ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF (RAF1) that are activated through dimerization. Mutations in RAF proteins have been observed in many cancers, such as melanoma, colorectal cancer (CRC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and thyroid cancer. We in-licensed naporafenib from Novartis Pharma AG (Novartis) in December 2022. Naporafenib has been dosed in over 500 patients to date, whereby safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics have been established in both monotherapy and select combinations, with clinical proof-of-concept (PoC) data in combination with trametinib (MEKINIST) for patients with NRASm melanoma, which includes NRAS Q61X melanoma. In December 2023, we announced that the US Food</p>
<p>and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track Designation (FTD) to naporafenib in combination with trametinib for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma who have progressed on, or are intolerant to, an anti -programmed death-1 (ligand 1) (PD -(L)1)-based regimen, and whose tumors contain an NRAS mutation (NRASm). Programs that receive FTD may benefit from early and frequent interactions with the FDA during the clinical development process and, if relevant criteria are met, the FDA may consider reviewing portions of a marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application.</p>
<p>Our development strategy for naporafenib includes our SEACRAFT trials designed to evaluate naporafenib in combination with other targeted therapies. We are advancing development for naporafenib plus trametinib in the Phase 3 SEACRAFT-2 trial for patients with NRASm melanoma, which we initiated in the second quarter of 2024. SEACRAFT-2 is supported by clinical PoC data in patients with NRASm melanoma, as presented by Novartis at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress 2022 medical conference and as published in March 2023 by de Braud et al. in the Journal of Clinical Oncology . In connection with our SEACRAFT-2 trial, we have entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement (CTCSA) with Novartis for its MEK inhibitor, trametinib. Pursuant to the CTCSA, we are sponsoring and funding the clinical trial and Novartis is providing its drug to us free of charge. In addition, we are evaluating additional combinations of naporafenib with our other RAS/MAPK pathway targeting agents and/or external agents in preclinical models.</p>
<p>On October 24, 2024, we announced preliminary data from our SEACRAFT-1 trial in an oral presentation at the 36th EORTC-NCI-AACR (ENA) Symposium. The preliminary clinical activity of naporafenib plus trametinib in the melanoma cohort of SEACRAFT-1 include, as of the efficacy cutoff date*:</p>
<ul>
<li>· 40% (4/10) response rate observed in the efficacy-evaluable patients with NRAS Q61X melanoma, including three confirmed partial responses and one unconfirmed partial response; the melanoma cohort in SEACRAFT-1 is generally representative of the patient population currently being enrolled in the pivotal SEACRAFT-2 trial</li>
<li>· 70% (7/10) of patients remained on treatment as of the data cutoff, including all four responders</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Safety data cutoff date was September 3, 2024. Efficacy data cutoff date was September 5, 2024.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we reported that naporafenib plus trametinib has been generally well tolerated as of the safety cutoff date, with mostly low-grade adverse events in the majority of patients. We believe that the use of mandatory primary rash prophylaxis helped reduce the frequency and severity of skin toxicities, reduced the drug discontinuation rate due to adverse events, and improved the observed tolerability as measured by the increased relative dose intensity, as compared to the prior clinical trials of naporafenib plus trametinib conducted by Novartis, which did not include the use of mandatory primary rash prophylaxis.</p>
<p>We believe that while the preliminary SEACRAFT-1 data do not support further exploration of a tissue-agnostic indication, they do reinforce the potential of the ongoing Phase 3 SEACRAFT-2 trial in patients with NRASm melanoma. We expect to read out randomized dose optimization data of naporafenib plus trametinib from Stage 1 of the SEACRAFT-2 Phase 3 trial in 2025. Stage 2 of the SEACRAFT-2 Phase 3 trial is expected to compare naporafenib plus trametinib against physician's choice of chemotherapy or trametinib using dual primary endpoints of progression free survival and overall survival for regulatory approval.</p>
<p>Our next two programs are part of our RAS-targeting franchise, which we in-licensed in May 2024, as described below. These two programs fit within our second approach of targeting RAS directly, both in its active GTP and inactive GDP states. The RAS targeting landscape can be divided into pan-RAS, pan-KRAS, and mutant-selective approaches. Pan-RAS and pan-KRAS targeting molecules can address a broad population of patients with G12X, G13X, and possibly Q61X mutations, and also have the potential to address or prevent resistance by blocking wildtype RAS activation.</p>
<p>ERAS-0015 is a potential best-in-class pan-RAS molecular glue for treating patients with RAS-altered solid tumors. ERAS-0015 has demonstrated approximately 5-10 times greater potency as well as favorable absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) and PK properties in multiple animal species versus the leading pan-RAS molecular glue in development. More specifically, ERAS-0015 has stronger binding to cyclophilin A relative to the leading pan-RAS molecular glue in development, which enables more potent RAS inhibition. ERAS-0015 also showed sub-nanomolar to nanomolar preclinical IC50 in vitro potency against KRAS G12X, KRAS G13D, and RAS wildtype. In vivo, ERAS-0015 showed approximately 10 times higher potency than the leading pan-RAS molecular glue in development and good tumor regression in multiple models. It also showed superior clearance, halflife, oral bioavailability, and kinetic solubility in preclinical evaluations. The initial clinical trial for ERAS-0015 will be AURORAS-1, for which we plan to file an investigational new drug application (IND) in the first half of 2025, with an anticipated Phase 1 monotherapy data readout in 2026.</p>
<p>ERAS-4001 is a potential first-in-class pan-KRAS inhibitor for treating patients with KRAS-altered solid tumors. The preclinical in vitro potency of ERAS4001 showed good activity against KRAS G12X and G13D mutations, as well as KRAS wildtype amplifications, with no activity against HRAS or NRAS wildtype proteins. Sparing wild-type HRAS and NRAS has the potential to provide a greater therapeutic window. ERAS-4001 showed activity against both GDP-bound ("inactive state") and GTP-bound ("active state") KRAS G12D with single digit nanomolar IC$_{50}$s in a biochemical RAS - RAF1 RBD (RAS Binding Domain) assay. In vivo, ERAS-4001 showed good tumor regression in multiple models. In combination with anti-PD-1, ERAS-4001 was able to achieve complete disappearance of tumors in mice on day 31. The initial clinical trial for ERAS-4001 will be BOREALIS-1, for which we plan to file an IND in the first quarter of 2025, with an anticipated Phase 1 monotherapy data readout in 2026.</p>
<p>ERAS-0015 and ERAS-4001 have the potential to address unmet needs in approximately 2.7 million patients who are diagnosed annually globally with RAS-mutant tumors, of which over 2.2 million patients are diagnosed with KRAS-mutant tumors.</p>
<p>In May 2024, in connection with entering into the Joyo License Agreement and Medshine License Agreement, a review of our strategic priorities, and our decision to deemphasize certain drug discovery activities, we approved a strategic reprioritization to focus our resources on our naporafenib program, ERAS-0015, and ERAS-4001. We deprioritized our HERKULES-3 clinical trial evaluating ERAS-007 in combination with encorafenib and cetuximab (EC) in patients with EC-naïve BRAFm colorectal cancer as we believe the clinical efficacy data do not support continued evaluation. We also deprioritized our THUNDERBBOLT-1 clinical trial evaluating ERAS-801 in patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM), although we plan to explore further advancement of ERAS-801, including via partnerships and select investigator-sponsored trials. Finally, we deprioritized our preclinical ERAS-4 program; however, certain of our existing ERAS-4 molecules may serve as backup compounds for ERAS-4001.</p>
<p>We are also advancing additional programs targeting key oncogenic drivers in the RAS/MAPK pathway, which we will need to successfully progress through appropriate preclinical activities (e.g., discovery and IND-enabling activities) prior to advancing these programs into clinical development, if at all.</p>
<p>We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if any of our product candidates obtain marketing approval. We are working with our current manufacturers to ensure that we will be able to scale up our manufacturing capabilities to support our clinical plans. We are also in the process of locating and qualifying additional manufacturers to build redundancies into our supply chain. In addition, we rely on third parties to package, label, store, and distribute our product candidates, and we intend to continue to rely on third parties with respect to our commercial products if marketing approval is obtained. We believe that this strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need for us to invest in our own manufacturing facilities, equipment, and personnel while also enabling us to focus our expertise and resources on the design and development of our product candidates.</p>
<p>In December 2022, we completed the sale and issuance of 15,384,616 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $6.50 per share (the 2022 Offering). Proceeds from the 2022 Offering were $94.9 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs of $5.1 million.</p>
<p>In March 2024, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with the purchasers named therein for the private placement of 21,844,660 shares of our common stock at a price of $2.06 per share, which closed on April 2, 2024 (the 2024 Private Placement). Proceeds from the 2024 Private Placement were $43.6 million, after deducting placement agent fees and expenses of approximately $1.4 million.</p>
<p>In May 2024, we completed the sale and issuance of 99,459,458 shares of our common stock, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 12,972,972 shares of our common stock, at a price to the public of $1.85 per share (the 2024 Offering). Proceeds from the 2024 Offering were $174.4 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs of $9.6 million.</p>
<p>In August 2022, we entered into an Open Market Sale Agreement (the Sale Agreement) with Jefferies LLC (the Agent), pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $200 million from time to time, in an "at-the-market offering" (ATM Offering) through the Agent. Sales of the shares of common stock, if any, will be made at prevailing market prices at the time of sale, or as otherwise agreed with the Agent. Pursuant to the Sale Agreement, the Agent will receive a commission from us of up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds of any shares of common stock sold under the Sale Agreement. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 9,231,114 shares of common stock under the Sale Agreement at a weighted-average price of $2.37 per share. Proceeds from the ATM Offering during the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $21.0 million, net of commissions and expenses of $0.8 million.</p>
<p>Since our inception in 2018, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, identifying, acquiring, and in-licensing our product candidates, establishing our intellectual property portfolio, conducting research, preclinical studies and clinical trials, establishing arrangements with third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates and related raw materials, and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We do not have any products approved for sale and have not generated any revenue. As of September 30, 2024, we have raised a total of $1.0 billion to fund our operations, comprised primarily of gross proceeds from our IPO, underwritten offerings, a private placement of our common stock and the sale and issuance of convertible preferred stock. As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $463.3 million.</p>
<p>We have incurred significant operating losses since inception. Our net losses were $31.2 million and $30.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $129.4 million and $95.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of September 30, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $735.4 million. We expect our expenses and operating losses will increase substantially for the foreseeable future, particularly if and as we conduct our ongoing and planned clinical trials and preclinical studies; continue our research and development activities; utilize third parties to manufacture our product candidates and related raw materials; hire additional personnel; acquire, in-license, or develop additional product candidates; expand and protect our intellectual property; and incur additional costs associated with being a public company. If we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, manufacturing, and distribution. In addition, as our product candidates progress through development and toward commercialization, we will need to make milestone payments to the licensors and other third parties from whom we have in-licensed or acquired our product candidates. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our clinical trials and preclinical studies and our expenditures on other research and development activities.</p>
<p>Based upon our current operating plans, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of September 30, 2024 will be sufficient to fund our operations into the first half of 2027. We do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our product candidates, which we expect will take a number of years and may never occur. Accordingly, until such time as we can generate significant revenue from sales of our product candidates, if ever, we expect to finance our cash needs through equity offerings, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses, and other similar arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and could force us to delay, limit, reduce, or terminate our research and development programs or other operations, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.</p>
<p>Our financial condition and results of operations may also be impacted by other factors we may not be able to control, such as geopolitical and economic events. We do not believe that such factors had a material adverse impact on our results of operations during the three months ended September 30, 2024.</p>
<h2>Our acquisition and license agreements</h2>
<h2>Guangzhou Joyo license agreement</h2>
<p>In May 2024, we entered into an exclusive license agreement (the Joyo License Agreement) with Guangzhou Joyo Pharmatech Co., Ltd.

<h2>Components of results of operations</h2>
<h2>Revenue</h2>
<p>We do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of products unless and until such time that our product candidates have advanced through clinical development and obtained regulatory approval, if ever. If we fail to complete preclinical and clinical development of product candidates or obtain regulatory approval for them, our ability to generate future revenues, and our results of operations and financial position would be adversely affected.</p>
<h2>Operating expenses</h2>
<h2>Research and development</h2>
<p>Research and development expenses consist of external and internal costs associated with our research and development activities, including our discovery and research efforts and the preclinical and clinical development of our product candidates. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Our research and development expenses include:</p>
<ul>
<li>· external costs, including expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as contract research organizations (CROs), contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), consultants and our scientific advisors; and</li>
<li>· internal costs, including:</li>
<li>· employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, and stock-based compensation for those individuals involved in research and development efforts;</li>
<li>· the costs of laboratory supplies and acquiring, developing and manufacturing preclinical study materials; and</li>
<li>· facilities and depreciation, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent of facilities and depreciation.</li>
</ul>

<p>We expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue to conduct our ongoing research and development activities, conduct clinical trials and advance our preclinical research programs toward clinical development, particularly as more of our product candidates move into later stages of development, which typically cost more. The process of conducting clinical trials and preclinical studies necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time-consuming. We may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for any of our product candidates.</p>
<p>The timelines and costs with research and development activities are uncertain, can vary significantly for each product candidate and program and are difficult to predict. We anticipate we will make determinations as to which product candidates and programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each product candidate and program on an ongoing basis in response to preclinical and clinical results, regulatory developments, ongoing assessments as to each product candidate's and program's commercial potential, and our ability to enter into collaborations, licenses, or other similar agreements to the extent we determine the resources or expertise of a third-party would be beneficial for a given product candidate or program. We will need to raise substantial additional capital in the future. In addition, we cannot forecast which product candidates and programs may be subject to future collaborations, licenses, or other agreements, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements.</p>
<p>Our development costs may vary significantly based on factors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>· the number and scope of preclinical and IND-enabling studies and clinical trials;</li>
<li>· per patient trial costs;</li>
<li>· the number of trials required for approval;</li>
<li>· the number of sites included in the trials;</li>
<li>· the countries in which the trials are conducted;</li>
<li>· the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;</li>
<li>· the number of patients that participate in the trials;</li>
<li>· the number of doses that patients receive;</li>
<li>· the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;</li>
<li>· potential additional safety monitoring requested by regulatory agencies;</li>
<li>· the duration of patient participation in the trials and follow-up;</li>
<li>· the cost and timing of manufacturing our product candidates;</li>
<li>· the phase of development of our product candidates;</li>
<li>· the efficacy and safety profile of our product candidates;</li>
<li>· the timing, receipt and terms of any approvals from applicable regulatory authorities;</li>
<li>· maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of our products following approval, if any;</li>
<li>· significant and changing government regulation and regulatory guidance;</li>
<li>· the impact of any interruptions to our operations or to those of third parties with whom we work due to geopolitical and economic events; and</li>
<li>· the extent to which we establish additional collaboration, license or other arrangements.</li>
</ul>
<h2>In-process research and development</h2>
<p>In-process research and development expenses include rights acquired as part of asset acquisitions or in-licenses to develop and commercialize product candidates. Upfront payments that relate to the acquisition of a new product candidate, as well as pre-commercial milestone payments, are immediately expensed as in-process research and development in the period in which they are incurred, provided that the new product candidate did not also include processes or activities that would constitute a "business" as defined under US generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP), the product candidate has not achieved regulatory approval for marketing and, absent obtaining such approval, has no established alternative future use.</p>
<p>In-process research and development expenses consist primarily of our upfront payments, milestone payments, and our stock issuances in connection with our acquisition and in-license agreements.</p>
<h2>General and administrative</h2>
<p>General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation, for employees in our finance, accounting, legal, information technology, business development and support functions. Other general and administrative expenses include allocated facility and depreciation related costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses and professional fees for auditing, tax, intellectual property and legal services. Costs related to filing and pursuing patent applications are recognized as general and administrative expenses as incurred since recoverability of such expenditures is uncertain.</p>
<p>We expect our general and administrative expenses will increase substantially for the foreseeable future as we continue to increase our general and administrative headcount to support our continued research and development activities and, if any product candidates receive marketing approval, commercialization activities, as well as to support our operations generally.</p>
<h2>Other income (expense), net</h2>
<h2>Interest income</h2>
<p>Interest income consists primarily of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.</p>

<h2>General and administrative expenses</h2>
<p>General and administrative expenses were $32.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $28.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of $3.5 million was primarily driven by an impairment charge of $1.7 million on operating lease assets, leasehold improvements, and furniture related to the sublease of the first floor of our San Diego facility during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, and increases of $1.4 million in legal fees and $1.1 million in stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by a decrease of $0.7 million in insurance costs.</p>
<h2>Other income (expense), net</h2>
<p>Other income (expense), net was $14.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 compared to $12.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase of $2.1 million was primarily related to an increase in interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $2.3 million, partially offset by a $0.4 million impairment charge on our investment in equity securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2024.</p>
<h2>Liquidity and capital resources</h2>
<h2>Sources of liquidity</h2>
<p>In July 2021, we completed our IPO and issued 21,562,500 shares of our common stock, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 2,812,500 shares of our common stock, at a price to the public of $16.00 per share. Our aggregate net proceeds from the offering were $317.0 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions of $24.2 million and offering costs of $3.8 million. Prior to the IPO, we received aggregate gross proceeds of $320.4 million from the sale of shares of our convertible preferred stock.</p>
<p>In August 2022, we entered into the Sale Agreement with the Agent, pursuant to which we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $200 million from time to time, in ATM Offerings through the Agent. Sales of the shares of common stock, if any, will be made at prevailing market prices at the time of sale, or as otherwise agreed with the Agent. Pursuant to the Sale Agreement, the Agent will receive a commission from us of up to 3.0% of the gross proceeds of any shares of common stock sold under the Sale Agreement. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, we sold 9,231,114 shares of common stock under the Sale Agreement at a weighted-average price of $2.37 per share. Proceeds from the ATM Offering during the three months ended September 30, 2024 were $21.0 million, net of commissions and expenses of $0.8 million.</p>
<p>In December 2022, we completed the 2022 Offering and issued 15,384,616 shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $6.50 per share. Proceeds from the 2022 Offering were $94.9 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs of $5.1 million.</p>
<p>In March 2024, in connection with the 2024 Private Placement, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with the purchasers named therein for the private placement of 21,844,660 shares of our common stock at a price of $2.06 per share, which closed on April 2, 2024. Proceeds from the 2024 Private Placement were $43.6 million, net of placement agent fees and expenses of approximately $1.4 million.</p>
<p>In May 2024, we completed the 2024 Offering and issued 99,459,458 shares of our common stock, including the exercise in full by the underwriters of their option to purchase 12,972,972 shares of our common stock, at a price to the public of $1.85 per share. Proceeds from the 2024 Offering were $174.4 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs of $9.6 million.</p>
<h2>Future capital requirements</h2>
<p>As of September 30, 2024, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $463.3 million. Based upon our current operating plans, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations into the first half of 2027. However, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results could vary materially. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could deplete our capital resources sooner than we expect. Additionally, the process of conducting preclinical studies and testing product candidates in clinical trials is costly, and the timing of progress and expenses in these studies and trials is uncertain.</p>
<p>Our future capital requirements are difficult to forecast and will depend on many factors, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>· the type, number, scope, progress, expansions, results, costs and timing of discovery, preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates that we are pursuing or may choose to pursue in the future, including the costs of any third-party products used in our combination clinical trials that are not covered by such third party or other sources;</li>
<li>· the costs and timing of manufacturing for our product candidates with CMOs, including commercial manufacturing, if any product candidate is approved;</li>
<li>· the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory review of our product candidates;</li>
<li>· the costs of obtaining, maintaining and enforcing our patents and other intellectual property rights;</li>
<li>· our efforts to enhance operational systems and hire additional personnel to satisfy our obligations as a public company, including enhanced internal controls over financial reporting;</li>
<li>· the costs associated with hiring additional personnel, consultants, and CROs as our preclinical and clinical activities increase;</li>
<li>· the timing and amount of the milestone or other payments we must make to the licensors and other third parties from whom we have in-licensed or acquired our product candidates or technologies;</li>
<li>· the costs and timing of establishing or securing sales and marketing capabilities if any product candidate is approved;</li>
<li>· our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance, coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors and adequate market share and revenue for any approved products;</li>
<li>· patients' willingness to pay out-of-pocket for any approved products in the absence of coverage and/or adequate reimbursement from third-party payors;</li>
<li>· the terms and timing of establishing and maintaining collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements;</li>
<li>· any delays and cost increases that result from geopolitical and economic events; and</li>
<li>· costs associated with any products or technologies that we may in-license or acquire.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have no other committed sources of capital. Until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements, if ever, we expect to finance our future cash needs primarily through equity offerings (including through the Sale Agreement), debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations, licenses and other similar arrangements. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be or could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, licensing, or other similar arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our research and development programs or other operations, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates to third parties that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.</p>

<h2>Operating activities</h2>
<p>Cash used in operating activities was $84.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024, primarily resulting from a net loss of $129.4 million and accretion on marketable securities of $7.2 million, partially reduced by in-process research and development expenses of $22.5 million in connection with our license agreements with Joyo and Medshine, which are reflected in investing activities, stock-based compensation expense of $20.7 million, an impairment charge of $4.7 million on operating lease assets, leasehold improvements and furniture, depreciation and amortization expense of $3.0 million, and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $0.6 million. Net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities consisted primarily of an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current and long-term liabilities of $3.6 million, partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses and other current and long-term assets of $2.6 million.</p>
<p>Cash used in operating activities was $76.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, primarily resulting from a net loss of $95.3 million and accretion on marketable securities of $4.8 million, partially reduced by stock-based compensation expense of $20.1 million, depreciation and amortization expense of $2.8 million, and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $0.8 million. Net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities consisted primarily of an increase in operating lease assets and liabilities, net of $3.3 million primarily due to the receipt of $2.3 million in reimbursement from our landlord for tenant improvements, and an increase in accounts payable of $0.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses and other current and long-term liabilities of $3.3 million.</p>
<h2>Investing activities</h2>
<p>Net cash used in investing activities was $179.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $95.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. The increase in cash used in investing activities of $83.5 million was primarily the result of increases in purchases of marketable securities of $82.8 million and in-process research and development of $2.5 million, partially offset by a decrease in purchases of property and equipment of $1.6 million.</p>
<h2>Financing activities</h2>
<p>Net cash provided by financing activities was $239.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 as compared to $0.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023. During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, we received $174.4 million of net proceeds for the issuance of common stock from the 2024 Offering, $43.6 million in net proceeds for the issuance of common stock from the 2024 Private Placement, $21.0 million in net proceeds for the issuance of common stock from the ATM offering, $0.4 million from the issuance of common stock under our Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) and $0.4 million from the exercise of stock options. During the nine months ended September 30, 2023, we received $0.5 million from the issuance of common stock under our ESPP and $0.3 million from the exercise of stock options.</p>
<h2>Contractual obligations and commitments</h2>
<p>As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of our business to the contractual obligations we reported in "Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - Cash requirements due to contractual obligations and other commitments," included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 27, 2024.</p>
<h2>Critical accounting policies and estimates</h2>
<p>This management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates. As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in "Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - Critical accounting policies and estimates," included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 27, 2024.</p>
<h2>Recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements</h2>
<p>See Note 2 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements.</p>
<h2>Emerging growth company and smaller reporting company status</h2>
<p>As an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the JOBS Act), we can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. This allows an emerging growth company to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, our condensed consolidated financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates. We also intend to rely on other exemptions provided by the JOBS Act, including without limitation, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley).</p>
<p>We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the consummation of our IPO; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion; (iii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a "large accelerated filer" as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700.0 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of such year; or (iv) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in nonconvertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.</p>
<p>We are also a smaller reporting company as defined in the Exchange Act. We may continue to be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an emerging growth company. We may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies and will be able to take advantage of these scaled disclosures for so long as our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $250.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter, or our annual revenue is less than $100.0 million during the most recently completed fiscal year and our voting and non-voting common stock held by non-affiliates is less than $700.0 million measured on the last business day of our second fiscal quarter.</p>
<h2>Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.</h2>
<p>As of September 30, 2024, there have been no material changes surrounding our market risk, including interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, and inflation risk, from the discussion provided in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 27, 2024.</p>
<h2>Item 4. Controls and Procedures.</h2>
<h2>Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures</h2>
<p>We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic and current reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.</p>
<p>Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.</p>
<h2>Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting</h2>
<p>There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<h2>PART II-OTHER INFORMATION</h2>
<h2>Item 1. Legal Proceedings.</h2>
<p>We are not currently a party to any material proceedings. From time to time, we may become involved in legal proceedings or be subject to claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Regardless of outcome, such proceedings or claims can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of resources and other factors, and there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained.</p>
<h2>Item 1A. Risk Factors.</h2>
<p>There have been no material changes to the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on March 27, 2024.</p>
<h2>Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.</h2>
<p>None.</p>
<h2>Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.</h2>
<p>Not applicable.</p>
<h2>Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.</h2>
<p>Not applicable.</p>
<h2>Item 5. Other Information.</h2>
<p>During the three months ended September 30, 2024, none of our officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f)) or directors adopted, materially modified or terminated any Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement, as each such term is defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K.</p>
