        answer: >
          Major regulatory achievements included: 1) Submission and acceptance of
          MAA to EMA for ANAVEX®2-73 in Alzheimer's disease in 2024 2)
          Maintained Orphan Drug Designation for Rett syndrome and infantile
          spasms 3) Received Rare Pediatric Disease designation for Rett
          syndrome 4) Advanced multiple clinical programs through various phases
          with regulatory support
      - question: How did the clinical trial results evolve across different indications?
        answer: >
          Trial results showed consistent progress: 1) Phase 2b/3 Alzheimer's
          trial met primary endpoints with 36.3% slowing of progression 2) Rett
          syndrome AVATAR trial showed statistically significant improvements in
          RSBQ and CGI-I 3) Pediatric EXCELLENCE trial demonstrated early onset
          of action at 4 weeks 4) Consistent safety profile maintained across
          all trials
  - context: >
