          continuing CAR-NK platform advancement
      - question: What key regulatory milestones were achieved?
        answer: >
          Major regulatory achievements included: 1) CB-010 received RMAT
          designation for r/r LBCL 2) Fast track designation granted for CB-010
          in r/r B-NHL 3) Orphan drug designation for CB-010 in follicular
          lymphoma 4) CB-011 received fast track and orphan drug designations
          for r/r MM
      - question: How did the clinical development strategy evolve?
        answer: >
          The strategy evolved through: 1) Expansion of CB-010 ANTLER trial into
          second-line LBCL patients 2) Implementation of multiple dose levels in
          CaMMouflage trial for CB-011 3) Strategic initiation of AMpLify trial
          for CB-012 4) Focus on key hematologic malignancies with validated
          targets
