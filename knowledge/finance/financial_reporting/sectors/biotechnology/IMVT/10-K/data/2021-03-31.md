SUMMARY RISK FACTORS
--------------------

You should consider carefully the risks described under "Risk Factors" in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.References to "we," "us," and "our" in this section titled "Summary Risk Factors" refer to Immunovant, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. A summary of the risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects include the following:

* · Our success relies upon a singular product candidate, IMVT-1401, for which all clinical development by the Company has paused due to its presumed causation of elevated lipid levels in patients dosed with the drug. Unless we can determine a dosing regimen, target patient population, safety monitoring and risk management for IMVT-1401 in autoimmune diseases for which the risks of lipid elevations and albumin reductions can be mitigated, we will not be able to show adequate benefit to risk ratio and will not be able to continue clinical development or seek or obtain marketing authorization in any jurisdiction.
* · Our product candidate has caused and may cause adverse events (including but not limited to, elevated total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein ("LDL") levels and reductions in albumin) or have other properties that could delay or prevent its regulatory approval, cause us to further suspend or discontinue clinical trials, abandon further development or limit the scope of any approved label or market acceptance.
* · Clinical trials are very expensive, time-consuming, difficult to design and implement, and involve uncertain outcomes.
* · Enrollment and retention of patients in clinical trials is an expensive and time-consuming process and could be made more difficult or rendered impossible by multiple factors outside our control.
* · The results of our nonclinical and clinical trials may not support our proposed claims for our product candidate, or regulatory approval on a timely basis or at all, and the results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.
* · Interim, "top-line" or preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.
* · Our business is heavily dependent on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our sole product candidate, IMVT-1401.
* · We may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidate IMVT-1401 on a timely basis or at all.

Table of Contents
-----------------

* · Our business, operations and clinical development plans and timelines and supply chain could be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, including the ongoing global Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019, or the COVID-19 pandemic, on the manufacturing, clinical trials and other business activities performed by us or by third parties with whom we conduct business, including our contract manufacturers, contract research organizations, or CROs, shippers and others.
* · We expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.
* · RSL owns a significant percentage of shares of our common stock and may exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.
* · Our failure to maintain or continuously improve our quality management program could have an adverse effect upon our business, subject us to regulatory actions, cause a loss of patient confidence in us or our products, among other negative consequences.
* · We are reliant on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical trials, and if those third parties perform in an unsatisfactory manner or fail to comply with applicable requirements, or our quality management program fails to detect such events in a timely manner, it may harm our business.
* · Our third-party manufacturers may encounter difficulties in production, or our quality management program fails to detect quality issues at our third-party manufacturers, that may delay or prevent our ability to obtain marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, after approval.
* · We have a limited operating history and have never generated any product revenue.
* · We will require additional capital to fund our operations, and if we fail to obtain necessary financing, we may not be able to complete the development and commercialization of IMVT-1401.
* · Raising additional funds by issuing equity securities may cause dilution to existing stockholders, raising additional funds through debt financings may involve restrictive covenants, and raising funds through lending and licensing arrangements may restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.
* · We rely on the license agreement with HanAll Biopharma Co., Ltd., or the HanAll Agreement, to provide rights to the core intellectual property relating to IMVT-1401. Any termination or loss of significant rights under the HanAll Agreement would adversely affect our development or commercialization of IMVT-1401.
* · The HanAll Agreement obligates us to make certain milestone payments, some of which may be triggered prior to our potential commercialization of IMVT1401.
* · We may not be able to manage our business effectively if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel.
* · We plan to expand our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations.
* · We face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies targeting autoimmune disease indications, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.
* · We are subject to stringent and changing privacy and data security laws, contractual obligations, self-regulatory schemes, government regulation, and standards related to data privacy and security. Further, if our security measures are compromised now, or in the future, or the security, confidentiality, integrity or availability of, our information technology, software, services, communications or data is compromised, limited or fails, this could result in a material adverse effect on our business.

Item 1. Business

Overview
--------

We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on enabling normal lives for people with autoimmune diseases. We are developing a novel, fully human monoclonal antibody, IMVT-1401 (formerly referred to as RVT-1401), that selectively binds to and inhibits the neonatal fragment crystallizable receptor ("FcRn"). IMVT-1401 is the product of a multi-step, multi-year research program conducted by HanAll Biopharma Co., Ltd. ("HanAll") to design a highly potent anti-FcRn antibody optimized for subcutaneous delivery. We obtained rights to IMVT-1401 pursuant to our license agreement (the "HanAll Agreement") with HanAll. Pursuant to the HanAll Agreement, we will be responsible for future contingent payments and royalties, including up to an aggregate of $442.5 million upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales milestone events. We are also obligated to pay HanAll tiered royalties ranging from the mid-single digits to mid-teens on net sales of licensed products, subject to standard offsets and reductions as set forth in the HanAll Agreement.

Our product candidate has been dosed in small volumes (e.g., 2 mL) and with a 27-gauge needle, while still generating therapeutically relevant pharmacodynamic activity, important attributes that we believe will drive patient preference and market adoption. In nonclinical studies and in clinical trials conducted to date, IMVT-1401 has been observed to reduce immunoglobulin G ("IgG") antibody levels. High levels of pathogenic IgG antibodies drive a variety of autoimmune diseases and, as a result, we believe IMVT-1401 has the potential for broad application in these disease areas. We intend to develop IMVT-1401 in autoimmune diseases for which there is robust evidence that pathogenic IgG antibodies drive disease manifestation and for which reduction of IgG antibodies should lead to clinical benefit.

Autoimmune diseases are conditions where an immune response is inappropriately directed against the body's own healthy cells and tissues. According to a 2012 study by the American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association, approximately 50 million people in the United States suffer from one of more than 100 diagnosed autoimmune diseases. Predisposing factors may include genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers and other factors not yet known. Many of these diseases are associated with high levels of pathogenic IgG antibodies, which are the most abundant type of antibody produced by the human immune system, accounting for approximately 75% of antibodies in the plasma of healthy people. IgG antibodies are important in the defense against pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria. In many autoimmune diseases, IgG antibodies inappropriately develop against normal proteins found in the body, directing the immune system to attack specific organs or organ systems.

Unfortunately, safe and effective treatment options for patients suffering from autoimmune diseases are lacking. Currently available treatments are generally limited to corticosteroids and immunosuppressants in early-stage disease and intravenous immunoglobulin ("IVIg") or plasma exchange in later-stage disease. These approaches often fail to address patients' needs since they are limited by delayed onset of action, waning therapeutic benefit over time and unfavorable safety profiles.

FcRn plays a pivotal role in preventing the degradation of IgG antibodies. The physiologic function of FcRn is to modulate the catabolism of IgG antibodies, and inhibition of FcRn, such as through use of an anti-FcRn antibody, has been shown to reduce levels of pathogenic IgG antibodies. Completed clinical trials of Immunovant and other anti-FcRn antibodies in IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases have generated promising results, suggesting that FcRn is a therapeutically important pharmacologic target to reduce levels of these disease-causing IgG antibodies.

In several nonclinical studies and a multi-part Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers, intravenous and subcutaneous delivery of IMVT-1401 demonstrated dosedependent IgG antibody reductions and was observed to be generally well tolerated. In the highest dose cohort from the multiple-ascending dose portion of the Phase 1 clinical trial, four weekly subcutaneous administrations of 680 mg resulted in a mean maximum reduction of serum IgG levels of 78%, with a standard deviation of 2%. IMVT-1401 was generally well-tolerated in this study and the majority of adverse events reported were mild or moderate; as previously disclosed, lipid levels were not measured contemporaneously during these Phase 1 clinical trials of IMVT-1401. Injection site reactions were similar between IMVT-1401 and placebo arms.

We are developing IMVT-1401 as a fixed-dose, self-administered subcutaneous injection on a convenient weekly, or less frequent, dosing schedule as discussed below. As a result of our rational design, we believe that IMVT-1401, if developed and approved for commercial sale, would be differentiated from currently available, more invasive treatments for advanced IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases, (e.g., Myasthenia Gravis ("MG"), Thyroid Eye Disease ("TED", formerly referred to as Graves' Ophthalmopathy, or "GO"), Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia ("WAIHA"), Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura, Pemphigus Vulgaris, Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy, Bullous Pemphigoid, Neuromyelitis Optica, Pemphigus Foliaceus, Guillain-Barré Syndrome and PLA2R+ Membranous Nephropathy). In 2020, these diseases had an aggregate prevalence of approximately 278,000 patients in the United States and 480,000 patients in Europe.

To the extent we choose to develop IMVT-1401 for certain of these rare diseases, we plan to seek orphan drug designation in the United States and Europe, where applicable. Such designations would primarily provide financial and exclusivity incentives intended to make the development of orphan drugs financially viable. However, we have not yet obtained such designation for any of our target indications, and there is no certainty that we will obtain such designation, or maintain the benefits associated with such designation if we do obtain it.

We are developing IMVT-1401 as a fixed-dose subcutaneous injection, and have focused our initial development efforts on the treatment of MG, WAIHA and TED. We are also pursuing a series of other indications. MG is an autoimmune disease associated with muscle weakness with an estimated prevalence of one in 5,000, with up to 66,000 cases in the United States. In MG, patients develop pathogenic IgG antibodies that attack critical signaling proteins at the junction between nerve and muscle cells. The majority of MG patients suffer from progressive muscle weakness, with maximum weakness occurring within six months of disease onset in most patients. In severe cases, MG patients can experience myasthenic crisis, in which respiratory function is weakened to the point where it becomes life-threatening, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. In August 2020, we reported top-line results from an interim analysis of 15 participants in our ASCEND MG trial, a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2a clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of IMVT-1401 in patients with moderate-to-severe MG. After the interim analysis, two additional participants enrolled and were randomized. The trial is now completed. See " IMVT-1401 for the Treatment of Myasthenia Gravis " below for further discussion.

WAIHA is a rare hematologic disease in which autoantibodies mediate hemolysis, or the destruction of red blood cells ("RBCs"). Based on published estimates, we believe that there are approximately 42,000 patients in the United States and 67,000 patients in Europe living with WAIHA. The clinical presentation is variable and most commonly includes symptoms of anemia, such as fatigue, weakness, skin paleness and shortness of breath. In severe cases, hemoglobin levels are unable to meet the body's oxygen demand, which can lead to heart attacks, heart failure and even death. In August 2020, we initiated dosing for ASCEND WAIHA, our Phase 2, openlabel, sequential, two cohort clinical trial in patients with WAIHA. In February 2021, we voluntarily paused dosing in our clinical trials for IMVT-1401. Because the ASCEND WAIHA trial is an open label trial, the pause did not necessitate study termination but rather a suspension. See " Recent Developments in Our Clinical Programs " below for further discussion.

TED is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder that affects the muscles and other tissues around the eyes, which can be sight-threatening. TED has an estimated annual incidence of 16 in 100,000 women and 2.9 in 100,000 men in North America and Europe. Initial symptoms may include a dry and gritty ocular sensation, sensitivity to light, excessive tearing, double vision and a sensation of pressure behind the eyes. In March 2020, we announced initial results from our ASCEND GO-1 trial, a Phase 2a open-label single-arm clinical trial in Canada in seven patients with TED. This trial is now completed. In October 2019, we initiated dosing in our ASCEND GO-2 trial, a randomized, masked, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial in patients with moderate-to-severe active TED with confirmed autoantibodies to thyroidstimulating hormone receptor ("TSHR"). In February 2021, we voluntarily paused dosing in our clinical trials for IMVT-1401. Because the pause led to unblinding ASCEND GO-2, this trial was terminated after the last patient completed the withdrawal visit and the follow-up visit. See " Recent Developments in Our Clinical Programs " below for further discussion.

Recent Developments in Our Clinical Programs
--------------------------------------------

In February 2021, we voluntarily paused dosing in our clinical trials for IMVT-1401 due to elevated total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein ("LDL") levels observed in some trial subjects treated with IMVT-1401. We have informed regulatory authorities and trial subjects and investigators of this voluntary pause of dosing in our studies that were ongoing at that time, ASCEND GO-2, our Phase 2b trial in Thyroid Eye Disease and ASCEND WAIHA, our Phase 2 trial in Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia.

Program-wide Review
-------------------

In order to better characterize the observed lipid findings, we conducted from February 2021 through May 2021 a program-wide data review (including both clinical and nonclinical data) with input from external scientific and medical experts.

In our ASCEND GO-2 trial, lipid parameters were assessed at baseline, at week 12, and at week 20 following eight weeks off drug. Based on preliminary, unblinded data, median LDL cholesterol at week 12 was increased by approximately 12 mg/dL in the 255 mg dose group (corresponding to an increase from baseline of approximately 15%), by approximately 33 mg/dL in the 340 mg dose group (corresponding to an increase from baseline of approximately 37%), by approximately 62 mg/dL in the 680 mg dose group (corresponding to an increase from baseline of approximately 52%) and did not increase in the control group. The data analysis indicates a dose-dependent increase in lipids. Average high-density lipoprotein ("HDL") and triglyceride levels also increased but to a much lesser degree. We also observed correlated decreases in albumin levels and the rate and extent of albumin reductions were dose-dependent. Subjects receiving the 255 mg weekly dose ("QW") experienced the smallest reductions in albumin through week 12, with a median reduction of about 16% from baseline, while subjects receiving the 340 mg or 680 mg QW dose experienced median reductions of albumin of 26% or 40%, respectively. At week 20, both lipids and albumin returned to baseline.

In our open label ASCEND WAIHA trial, only two subjects completed 12 weeks of dosing prior to the program-wide pause in dosing, with three additional subjects partially completing the dosing period. Pre-specified and post-hoc lipid test results from these five subjects were analyzed along with post-hoc lipid test results performed on frozen samples from ASCEND MG subjects (where available) and post-hoc lipid test results from our Phase 1 Injection Site study. LDL elevations observed in the ASCEND WAIHA and ASCEND MG subject populations and in healthy subjects in the Phase 1 Injection Site Study also appeared to be dose-dependent and were generally consistent in magnitude with the elevations observed in ASCEND GO-2 subjects.

No major adverse cardiovascular events have been reported to date in IMVT-1401 clinical trials.

Integrated Safety Assessment and Regulatory Interactions
--------------------------------------------------------

It is our intent to resume development across multiple indications for IMVT-1401. We are in the process of drafting multiple study protocols and updating our programwide safety strategy for discussions with regulatory agencies. The elements of our development program will include extensive pharmacokinetic ("PK") and pharmacodynamic ("PD") modeling to select dosing regimens for IMVT-1401 which optimize reductions in total IgG levels while minimizing the impact on albumin and LDL levels, particularly for clinical studies containing long-term treatment extensions. These protocols will likely include protocol-directed guidelines for the management of any observed lipid abnormalities. While increases in LDL over an 8 to 12 week treatment duration would not be expected to pose a safety concern for patients, the risk-benefit profile of long-term administration of IMVT-1401 will need to incorporate any unfavorable effects on lipid profiles. Discussions with regulatory agencies, including the FDA, are expected to commence during the second half of the calendar year 2021.

Current Status of Our Clinical Trials
-------------------------------------

* · Myasthenia Gravis: In August 2020, we reported top-line results from an interim analysis of 15 participants in our ASCEND MG trial, a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2a clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of IMVT-1401 in patients with moderate-to-severe MG. After the interim analysis, two additional participants enrolled and were randomized. The trial is now completed. Before the voluntary pause of dosing, we had a favorable end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA on the design of our Phase 3 registrational program in MG and we were planning on advancing our clinical trials for this indication. Based on our integrated safety analysis, we plan to meet with the FDA to propose further development to evaluate additional dosing levels and regimens as well as to include additional safety monitoring and considerations such as lipid and albumin monitoring and incorporating an independent safety monitoring committee. Contingent upon FDA feedback, we plan to initiate a pivotal study in MG late in the calendar year 2021 or early part of the calendar year 2022.

Table of Contents
-----------------

* · Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia: Our ASCEND WAIHA trial is an open label trial and we are planning on advancing our clinical trials for this indication. During the fall of 2021, we plan to commence discussions with the FDA on re-initiating this study, incorporating additional safety considerations and risk management as well as additional dosing regimens. We anticipate re-initiating this study based on a favorable outcome from these meetings late in the calendar year 2021 or early part of the calendar year 2022.
* · Thyroid Eye Disease: Our voluntary pause in dosing led to unblinding of the ASCEND GO-2 trial and this trial was terminated after the last patient completed the withdrawal visit and the follow-up visit. Treatment with IMVT-1401 reduced both IgG and disease specific pathogenic IgG over the 12-week treatment period. However, the efficacy results, based on approximately half the anticipated number of subjects who had reached the week 13 primary efficacy analysis at the time of the termination of the trial, were inconclusive. The primary endpoint of the proportion of proptosis responders was not met, and although not tested statistically, post hoc evaluation of other endpoints measured (Clinical Activity Score ("CAS") and diplopia scores) indicated the desired magnitude of treatment effect likely would not have been achieved. However, levels of IgG were reduced across IMVT-1401 dosing groups, and analysis of the receptor occupancy data suggest binding of IMVT-1401 to the Fc receptor. Additional exploratory work on other disease biomarkers is under evaluation. Further discussions with external experts are ongoing to determine whether a specific population can be identified to optimize the clinical performance of IMVT-1401. Based on these analyses, we are likely to design another Phase 2 trial in TED or another thyroid-related disease as our next study in this therapeutic area and initiate discussions with regulatory authorities before the end of the calendar year 2021.

Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Pharmacodynamics (PD)
-----------------------------------------------

The PK and PD (including serum concentrations of total IgG, albumin, and lipids) of IMVT-1401 were evaluated in healthy subjects in our Phase 1 clinical trial and Phase 1 Injection Site Study, and in patients with MG, TED and WAIHA in our ASCEND MG, ASCEND GO-1, ASCEND GO-2 and ASCEND WAIHA trials. Over the course of development, we have made significant progress in understanding the PK profiles, PD responses, and PK/PD relationships for IMVT-1401. In addition, we have established preliminary population PK and population PK/PD models using pooled data from all clinical studies to better understand and predict the PK and PD properties associated with various treatment regimens across different populations.

To date, single doses of IMVT-1401 ranged from 100 mg to 1530 mg IV and 1.5 mg/kg to 765 mg and were administered by subcutaneous injections ("SC") to healthy subjects. Multiple doses of 255 mg, 340 mg, and 680 mg SC QW have been studied in healthy subjects (up to 4 weeks of dosing) and patients with TED, MG, or WAIHA (up to 12 weeks of dosing). Based on preliminary data from our ASCEND GO-2 trial in TED, drug concentrations achieved after 680 mg SC QW resided predominantly in the linear elimination phase of the PK profile and were estimated to maintain target saturation during the dosing intervals in most subjects. The mean maximal reduction of total IgG achieved with maximal target engagement was approximately 80% and was achieved after 7 weeks of dosing. Drug concentrations achieved with 255 mg or 340 mg SC QW did not maintain target saturation throughout the dosing intervals in the majority of subjects; total IgG levels continued to decrease and were reduced by median Emax of approximately 62% and 69%, respectively, at the end of the 12-week dosing period. The shoulder region of the doseresponse curve for reduction in total IgG was covered and observed. Within the dose range studied, the rate and extent of albumin reductions and lipid elevations were dose-dependent across different populations. Over a 12-week dosing period, median Emax of albumin reductions were approximately 16%, 26%, 40% and median increases in LDL were approximately 15%, 37% and 52% for the 255 mg, 340 mg and 680 mg SC QW doses, respectively. The lipid elevations were highly correlated with albumin reductions. Unlike the PK/PD relationship for total IgG, the shoulder region of the dose-response curves for reduction in albumin and increases in LDL were not clearly observed. Total IgG, albumin, and lipids levels returned to baseline within eight weeks after the last dose of a 12-week treatment.

Comprehensive understanding of the PK and PD characteristics of IMVT-1401 has enabled creation of robust mathematical models to support the selection of future dosing regimens. The discordance between the PK/PD response relationship for IgG and that of albumin or LDL suggests options for dosing regimens that provide potentially effective reductions in total IgG (and pathologic autoantibodies) while minimizing effects on albumin and LDL levels. Optimized dosing regimens, if shown to be effective, could improve the risk/benefit profile of IMVT-1401 while the ease of administration of our current formulation could enhance the overall patient experience.

Potential New Indications
-------------------------

We continue to evaluate potential new indications for IMVT-1401 by considering a number of factors including, but not limited to, degree of unmet need, degree of potential benefit offered by the treatment, safety-related parameters, target patient population size, likely duration of dosing and commercial potential.

We have identified many attractive first-in-class indications with high unmet need and scientific rationale for anti-FcRn therapy. In our studies to date, we learned that IMVT-1401 has the potential to be more effective than we expected at providing therapeutic relief for patients across a broad range of indications. We also believe that certain indications with existing anti-FcRn programs also offer a significant opportunity to provide unique patient benefit and therefore a strong commercial opportunity. Accordingly, we plan to announce two new indications and submit INDs and our trial designs to the FDA over the next 12 months. For competitive reasons, we will likely announce these indications only after we have agreement with the FDA that we may proceed with a planned protocol. We believe that one or two of these new indications will involve a new phase 2 program whereas one of our new indications can begin with a pivotal study in 2022.

Business Strategy
-----------------

Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company in the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for autoimmune diseases with significant unmet need. To execute our strategy, we plan to:

* · Maximize the probability of success of IMVT-1401. We plan to leverage IMVT-1401's differentiated profile in target indications where the anti-FcRn mechanism has already established clinical proof-of-concept. We intend to identify and target a variety of IgG-mediated autoimmune indications based on the following factors:
* · Insufficient benefit of the standard of care;
* · Disease severity that warrants novel therapies;
* · Ability to rapidly establish proof-of-concept through comparatively short duration clinical trials using validated clinical endpoints; and
* · Ability to rapidly initiate pivotal trial programs and potentially receive regulatory approval.
* · Broad, portfolio-level criteria for the selection of new indications. We are including not only new indications that could enhance our speed to market such as chronic indications with high unmet need and less competition, but also indications requiring shorter-term dosing, and indications where we can take advantage of data and momentum achieved through our studies in MG, WAIHA and TED.
* · Rapidly advance development of IMVT-1401 for the treatment of MG and WAIHA. We are currently developing IMVT-1401 for the treatment of MG and WAIHA by leveraging the strong biologic rationale of targeting FcRn to reduce IgG antibody levels and the clinical and regulatory insights gained from other FcRn-targeted therapies in MG. We also recognize the need to quickly explore subpopulations in TED to determine if the clinical performance of IMVT-1401 can be optimized in this indication.
* · Identify and acquire or in-license additional innovative therapies for autoimmune diseases. Our controlling stockholder, Roivant Sciences Ltd. ("RSL"), and its subsidiaries, have a track record of acquiring or in-licensing products in a range of therapeutic areas. We will continue to partner and collaborate with RSL in identifying and evaluating potential acquisition and in-licensing opportunities in support of our goal to develop and commercialize innovative therapies for autoimmune diseases with significant unmet need.

IMVT-1401
---------

Overview
--------

IMVT-1401 (formerly referred to as RVT-1401) is a novel, fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to and inhibits FcRn. In our Phase 1 clinical trial, IMVT-1401 has demonstrated dose-dependent reductions in serum levels of IgG antibodies and was generally well-tolerated following subcutaneous and intravenous administration to healthy volunteers. In addition, completed clinical trials of other anti-FcRn antibodies have produced positive proof-of-concept activity in multiple IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases. We believe that these data support FcRn as a viable pharmacologic target with the potential to address multiple IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases. We intend to develop IMVT-1401 as a fixed-dose, self-administered subcutaneous injection on a convenient weekly, or less frequent, dosing schedule.

IMVT-1401 has been assigned the nonproprietary name batoclimab on the World Health Organization's Recommended International Nonproprietary Names List.

-----------------

Generation of IMVT-1401 and In Vitro Properties
-----------------------------------------------

IMVT-1401 is the result of a multi-step, multi-year research program conducted by our partner, HanAll, to engineer an antibody with the potency, specificity, safety, and pharmacokinetic properties optimized for subcutaneous administration. The selection of initial candidates was the result of screening a library of nearly 10,000 antibodies generated from both transgenic animal systems as well as phage-display libraries. These initial candidates were prioritized based on:

* · Potency and specificity for FcRn;
* · Ability to block the IgG-FcRn interaction;
* · Ability to remain bound to FcRn regardless of pH;
* · High production and stability in standard antibody production cell lines;
* · Ability to achieve high concentrations appropriate for subcutaneous delivery; and
* · Potential lack of immunogenicity.

IMVT-1401 was generated using the OmniAb transgenic rat platform from Open Monoclonal Technology ("OMT"). OMT was later acquired by Ligand Pharmaceuticals in 2015.

IMVT-1401 has been engineered to express specific known mutations that eliminate effector function. Traditional antibodies contain amino acid sequences that can trigger antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity ("ADCC") or complement-dependent cytotoxicity ("CDC") in which bound antibodies are recognized by effector components of the immune system which leads to inflammation. While this is an important mechanism for elimination of pathogens, triggering ADCC or CDC can lead to unintended immune activation and side effects. For this reason, IMVT-1401 was engineered with specific and validated mutations known to reduce ADCC and CDC.

Potential Benefits of IMVT-1401
-------------------------------

As a result of the rational design of IMVT-1401, we believe that IMVT-1401, if approved for use, could provide the following benefits:

* · Subcutaneous delivery . Based on PK/PD and clinical data, we believe that we will be able to obtain therapeutically relevant levels of IgG reduction using 2mL or lesser volume subcutaneous injections. Our current formulation is concentrated at 170 mg/mL.
* · Simple dosing schedule . We are developing IMVT-1401 as a fixed-dose subcutaneously administered regimen without the need for preceding intravenous induction doses or lengthy subcutaneous infusions. If approved, we intend to market IMVT-1401 as a fixed-dose pre-filled syringe or auto-injector, which would allow for convenient self-administration, eliminating the need for frequent and costly clinic visits, and reduce complexity and errors associated with calculating individual doses.
* · Low immunogenicity risk. IMVT-1401 is a fully human monoclonal antibody, and therefore contains only amino acid sequences native to humans, hypothesizing a lower risk of immunogenicity development.
* · Low effector function. IMVT-1401 has been engineered to prevent activation of other components of the immune system, and, as a result, unintended immune response to IMVT-1401 is not expected. Specifically, well-characterized and validated mutations introduced into the fragment crystallizable domain of IMVT-1401 have reduced its ability to cause ADCC and CDC.

FcRn, IgG Antibody Recycling and IMVT-1401 Mechanism of Action
--------------------------------------------------------------

The neonatal fragment crystallizable receptor is a cellular receptor that can bind IgG antibodies and guide their transport through cells. FcRn is named as such given its critical role in transferring maternal IgG antibodies contained in breast milk across the gut into the neonate's bloodstream, providing passive immunity until such time as the child is sufficiently mature to produce its own antibodies. FcRn is also involved in the transfer of maternal IgG antibodies across the placenta in the developing fetus.

Table of Contents
-----------------

In adults, FcRn is the primary protein responsible for preventing the degradation of IgG antibodies and albumin, the most abundant protein found in the blood. IgG antibodies are constantly being removed from circulation and internalized in cellular organelles called endosomes. The role of FcRn is to bind to the IgG antibodies under the more acidic conditions of the endosome and transport them to the cell surface, where the neutral pH causes them to be released back into circulation. This FcRn mechanism of action and IgG antibody recycling is depicted in the graphic below.

FcRn and IgG Antibody Recycling
-------------------------------

imvt-20210331\_g1.jpg

Our product candidate, IMVT-1401, is designed to block the recycling of IgG antibodies, resulting in their removal from circulation. IMVT-1401 binds to FcRn, blocking the ability of FcRn to bind to IgG antibodies under the more acidic conditions of the endosome. As a result, the bound IMVT-1401 and FcRn are transported to the cell surface, where FcRn is prevented from further recycling IgG antibodies as IMVT-1401 remains bound to FcRn even in the pH neutral environment outside the endosome. Meanwhile, the unbound IgG antibodies are degraded in the lysosome rather than being transported by FcRn for release back into circulation. This IMVT1401 mechanism of action is depicted in the graphic below.

Clinical Development of IMVT-1401
---------------------------------

We are developing IMVT-1401 as a fixed-dose subcutaneous injection for a variety of IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases, and have focused our initial development efforts on the treatment of MG, WAIHA and TED . We are also pursuing a series of other indications.

Phase 1 Clinical Trials of IMVT-1401 in Healthy Volunteers
----------------------------------------------------------

We have completed a multi-part, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trial involving 99 healthy volunteers in Australia and Canada, administering IMVT-1401 both as an intravenous infusion and as a subcutaneous injection. In this trial, 77 subjects received at least one dose of IMVT-1401 and 22 subjects received placebo. The results of our Phase 1 trial are presented below:

Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics
-------------------------------------

The PK and PD (including serum concentrations of total IgG, albumin, and lipids) of IMVT-1401 were evaluated in healthy subjects in our Phase 1 clinical trial and Phase 1 Injection Site Study, and in patients with MG, TED and WAIHA in our ASCEND MG, ASCEND GO-1, ASCEND GO-2 and ASCEND WAIHA trials. To date, single doses of IMVT-1401 ranged from 100 mg to 1530 mg IV and 1.5 mg/kg to 765 mg SC and were administered to healthy subjects. Multiple doses of 255 mg, 340 mg and 680 mg SC QW have been studied in healthy subjects (up to 4 weeks of dosing) and patients with TED, MG or WAIHA (up to 12 weeks of dosing).

Pharmacokinetics
----------------

IMVT-1401 exhibited a non-linear PK profile which was typical of that characterized by target-mediated drug disposition ("TMDD"). The elimination of IMVT-1401 can be divided into three phases according to the concentrations. The first phase shows linear elimination; when drug concentrations are high enough to saturate targets, drug elimination is governed by linear non-target-related routes, together with a fixed rate of target-mediated elimination, which is negligible in this phase. At the second phase, the drug concentrations become lower, the targets are not all saturated and both non-target-mediated and target-mediated elimination routes are important, resulting in nonlinear PK. At the last phase, the drug concentrations are so low that targets are not saturated, the target mediated elimination becomes the main route of elimination, and the PK becomes linear again. The drug concentrations achieved after 680 mg SC QW dose were mainly in the linear elimination phase of the PK profile, may maintain target saturation during the dosing intervals for most of the subjects. However, the drug concentrations achieved after the 340 mg or 255 mg SC QW dose may not always maintain target saturation during the dosing intervals for majority of the subjects.

Pharmacodynamics
----------------

Currently, ASCEND GO-2 in TED is the largest study (total of 65 subjects, including 18 subjects on placebo) evaluated placebo and 3-dose levels of IMVT-1401 at 255 mg, 340 mg and 680 mg administered SC weekly for 12 weeks ("QW*12"). The preliminary PD results of total IgG by time and treatment group is presented in Figure 1 . The baseline serum levels of total IgG, albumin, LDL, and HDL were comparable across all treatment groups. After active treatment, the levels of total IgG and albumin started to decrease, but the levels of LDL and HDL started to increase; both the rate and extent of reductions in total IgG and albumin or elevations of LDL and HDL were dose dependent. After 255 mg, 340 mg or 680 mg QW*12, the median Emax of total IgG reduction was 62%, 69% or 80%, respectively. For Groups 255 mg and 340 mg, total IgG levels continued to decrease as of week 12 (the last injection). For Group 680 mg, total IgG reached maximum reduction around week 7, and maintained in a plateau-like manner between weeks 7 to 12. The median Emax of albumin reduction was 16%, 26% or 40% for the 255 mg, 340 mg or 680 mg QW*12 doses, respectively. For Groups 340 mg and 680 mg, albumin levels continued to decrease as of week 12 (the last injection). For Group 255 mg, albumin reduction reached maximum around week 8, and maintained in a plateau-like manner between weeks 8 to 12. After 255 mg, 340 mg or 680 mg QW*12, the median elevation at Week 12 was 15%, 37% or 52%, respectively for LDL, and 14%, 10% or 25%, respectively for HDL. For all three active dose groups, the levels of total IgG, albumin, LDL and HDL returned to baseline within 8 weeks after the last dose of the 12-week treatment.

-----------------

The relationships of the PD effects in total LDL vs. albumin indicate that the time course and extent of LDL elevations were highly correlated with albumin reductions. The reductions in both IgG and albumin were also highly correlated, with a coefficient of determination of R = 0.793. It was also noted that the lipid elevations were not correlated with changes in thyroid hormone levels (no correlations to changes in T3, T4 or TSH was observed). 2

Within the dose range studied, the rate and extent of total IgG reductions, albumin reductions and lipid elevations were dose dependent across different populations and the shoulder region of the dose-response curve for total IgG reductions was covered and observed. However, the shoulder region of the dose-response curve for albumin reductions or lipid elevations was not clearly observed. The extent of PD response was much larger in reductions of total IgG than reductions of albumin or elevations of lipids.

Comprehensive understanding of the PK and PD characteristics of IMVT-1401 has enabled creation of robust mathematical models to support the selection of future dosing regimens. The discordance between the PK/PD response relationship for IgG and that of albumin or LDL suggests options for dosing regimens that provide potentially effective reductions in total IgG (and pathologic autoantibodies) while minimizing effects on albumin and LDL levels. Optimized dosing regimens, if shown to be effective, could improve the risk/benefit profile of IMVT-1401 while the ease of administration of our current formulation could enhance the overall patient experience.

Safety Data
-----------

We conducted, from February 2021 through May 2021, a program-wide data review, including safety data review, with input from external scientific and medical experts. The safety data review for each of the studies is described below.

In our multi-part, placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trial, IMVT-1401 was observed to be generally well-tolerated with no Grade 3 or Grade 4 treatment-emergent AEs and no discontinuations due to AEs. The most commonly reported AEs were mild erythema and swelling at the injection site, which typically resolved within hours and had a similar incidence between subjects receiving IMVT-1401 and placebo. These reactions at the injection site were not considered dose-related and did not increase with multiple administrations of IMVT-1401 in the multiple-dose cohorts. As previously disclosed, two serious AEs were reported, both of which were assessed as unrelated to IMVT-1401 by the study investigator. There were no treatment-related serious AEs reported.

A summary of the most commonly reported AEs, defined as the AE reported occurred in more than one subject, is set forth in the table below:

In November 2018, one serious AE (malpighian carcinoma) occurred in a 51-year-old subject who had received a single 765 mg subcutaneous administration of IMVT1401. Fifty-five days after study drug administration, the subject presented to his personal physician with a left-sided neck mass. Biopsy results determined the mass to be a poorly differentiated malpighian carcinoma, which was assessed as unrelated to IMVT-1401 by the study investigator. In February 2019, a 25-year-old subject who received a single dose 1530 mg of IMVT-1401 by intravenous infusion presented five days later with uncomplicated acute appendicitis and the presence of an appendiceal stone. The subject underwent laparoscopic appendectomy and recovered with an uneventful post-operative course. The event was considered unrelated to study drug by the study investigator.

Dose-dependent and reversible albumin reductions were observed in the single-ascending and multiple-ascending dose cohorts. In the 680 mg multiple-ascending dose cohort, most subjects appeared to reach nadir before administration of the final dose. Mean reduction in albumin levels at day 28 were 20% in the 340 mg multiple-dose cohort, and 31% in the 680 mg multiple-dose cohort. For subjects in the 340 mg and 680 mg cohorts, the mean albumin levels at day 28 were 37.5 g/L and 32.4 g/L, respectively (normal range 36-51 g/L). These reductions were not associated with any AEs or clinical symptoms and did not lead to any study discontinuations.

-----------------

Our Phase 1 Injection Site study, a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover study to characterize the PK, PD, safety and tolerability of IMVT-1401 was administered as single subcutaneous doses in three different injection sites in healthy participants (N = 21). In this trial, IMVT-1401 was generally well tolerated with no serious AEs reported and there were no discontinuations due to AEs. All AEs were assessed to be unrelated to IMVT-1401 by the study investigator. Mild headache was reported in 33% of the overall group as compared with 25% of the placebo group.

In our ASCEND GO-1 clinical trial, where seven participants completed the treatment period of the study and five of those participants completed the follow-up, off treatment period (the two discontinuations were not related to the study), the safety and tolerability profile observed was consistent with the Phase 1 clinical trials. In this trial, no serious AEs were observed and there were no discontinuations due to AEs. IMVT-1401 was generally well-tolerated, with the reported AEs, ranging from mild to moderate, being increase in weight, cough, fatigue, palpitations, light-headedness, and low blood pressure. One participant had a pre-existing condition of hypertension with borderline low platelets at baseline and a low platelet count after week 18.

In our ASCEND MG clinical trial, which included five participants in the 340 mg dose group, six participants in the 680 mg dose group and six participants in the placebo group, two serious AEs were reported but determined to be unrelated to IMVT-1401 by the study investigator.

In our ASCEND GO-2 clinical trial, five out of 18 participants in the 680 mg dose group reported peripheral edema with no such events noted in the other treatment groups. The events were Grade 1 or 2 (on a scale of 1 to 5), were limited in duration, and did not require permanent discontinuation of study drug. There were no reported cardiac events and injection site erythema was more common in the treated groups as compared with the placebo group. In the 255 mg dose group, one AE, optic neuropathy, was considered serious due to hospitalization, but was ultimately determined to be unrelated to the study and the participant later recovered. Triglycerides were elevated in the 340 mg and 680 mg dose groups with two participants reporting levels above 300 mg/dL and \<400 mg/dL. No other serious AEs were reported.

The ASCEND WAIHA study is an ongoing, open-label trial that has been evaluated with interim results. To date, one of the five trial subjects discontinued therapy after three 680 mg SC QW doses due to a serious AE (Immune thrombocytopenia). In January 2021, a 59-year-old subject presented for the scheduled week 4 study visit and reported gingival bleeding. The week 4 dose was not administered and laboratory results revealed decreases in platelet count. Platelet count was already at a decreased level at the time of enrollment. The subject received multiple platelet transfusions over the following few weeks. In February 2021, the AE was considered as resolved and no further transfusions were needed at that time. The study investigator considered the event related to aggravation of underlying disease activity (hemolytic anemia with immune thrombocytopenia) since the subject had decreased platelet counts at initial diagnosis; however, the study investigator stated that the investigational product's role in causing or aggravating thrombocytopenia cannot be ruled out. The adverse event was determined to be possibly related to study drug.

As previously disclosed, lipid levels were not measured contemporaneously during these Phase 1, ASCEND MG and ASCEND GO-1 clinical trials of IMVT-1401. See " Recent Developments in Our Clinical Programs " for further discussion about lipid and albumin changes noted in our clinical trials.

Across all the clinical trial groups to date, we believe the safety profile of IMVT-1401 at the doses studied over a treatment interval of at least 12 weeks is acceptable and supports further development of these dosing regimens. As discussed in " Recent Developments in Our Clinical Programs, " dose-dependent decreases in albumin levels have been observed with IMVT-1401; however, these decreases were generally asymptomatic except for the potentially expected AE of peripheral edema which was observed only in the 680 mg dose group and resolved without permanent discontinuation of IMVT-1401. Dose-related increases in LDL and total cholesterol have also been observed with IMVT-1401. While increases in LDL of this magnitude over a 12-week treatment duration would not be expected to pose a safety concern for patients, the risk-benefit profile of long-term administration of IMVT-1401 will need to incorporate any unfavorable effects on lipid profiles. Future study designs which include long-term treatment extensions will employ extensive PK/PD modeling to select dosing regimens that optimize reductions in total IgG while minimizing effects on albumin and LDL. These protocols will likely include protocol-directed guidelines for the management of any observed lipid abnormalities. The indications that we are pursuing with IMVT-1401 are associated with substantial morbidity and currently available treatments (e.g., high dose intravenous methylprednisolone) associated with significant side effects. Therefore, we believe that, if IMVT-1401 is found to be effective in these diseases, the safety profile observed to date should result in a favorable risk-benefit profile for IMVT-1401.

No major adverse cardiovascular events have been reported to date in IMVT clinical trials.

Immunogenicity Data
-------------------

The development of anti-drug antibodies ("ADA") to IMVT-1401 was assessed across all dosed cohorts following single (IV and SC formulations) and multiple (SC formulation) administrations of IMVT-1401. Preliminary data show a similar frequency of treatment-emergent ADA development among subjects who received at least one administration of IMVT-1401 or placebo (8% and 6%, respectively). The antibody titers were low (≤ 1:16) consistent with the high sensitivity of the ADA assay. No subjects in either the 340 mg or 680 mg multiple ascending dose cohorts developed ADAs with treatment. ADAs will continue to be monitored throughout the development program.

IMVT-1401 for the Treatment of Myasthenia Gravis
------------------------------------------------

Myasthenia Gravis Overview
--------------------------

MG is an autoimmune disorder associated with muscle weakness and fatigue. MG patients develop antibodies that lead to an immunological attack on critical signaling receptor proteins at the junction between nerve and muscle cells, thereby inhibiting the ability of nerves to communicate properly with muscles. This leads to muscle weakness intensified by activity, which can be localized to exclusively to ocular muscles or which can be more generalized throughout the body including muscles of respiration. Patients with localized ocular disease suffer from more limited symptoms, including droopy eyelids and blurred or double vision due to compromise of eye movements. The vast majority of MG patients demonstrate elevated serum levels of acetylcholine receptor ("AChR") antibodies which disrupt signal transmission between nerve fibers and muscle fibers. These antibodies ultimately lead to fluctuating muscle weakness and fatigue.

The prevalence of MG is estimated to be one in 5,000, with up to 66,000 cases expected in the United States. MG can occur at any age; however, the age of onset tends to follow a bimodal distribution. Early onset disease usually occurs in individuals between 10 to 30 years old and predominantly affects females. Later onset disease usually occurs in individuals over 50 years old and predominantly affects males. As with many autoimmune diseases, there are no known genetic alterations that specifically cause MG, and in most patients, it arises spontaneously. Approximately 3% of patients have a primary relative with MG, suggesting that there are genetic factors that may predispose development of the disease, but these genes have yet to be identified.

The symptoms of the disease can be transient and in the early stages of the disease can remit spontaneously. However, as the disease progresses, symptom-free periods become less frequent and disease exacerbations can last for months or remain chronic. After 15 to 20 years, some weakness often becomes fixed, with the most severely affected muscles frequently becoming atrophic. Many patients find it difficult to perform daily activities due to both insufficient improvement in symptoms even after treatment and in some the complicating long-term side effects of oral corticosteroids, a common treatment for MG. Approximately 15% to 20% of MG patients will experience at least one myasthenic crisis over their lifetimes. During myasthenic crisis, the impairment of muscles required to breathe can become life-threatening, leading to death in approximately 2% to 5% of cases. Up to 90% of patients in myasthenic crisis require intubation and mechanical ventilation leading to hospital stays lasting a median of 17 days. Over half of the patients who survive such a crisis remain functionally dependent upon discharge from the hospital.

These broad classes of MG severity are often referred to by a clinical classification system described by the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America ("MGFA") the only national volunteer health agency in the United States dedicated solely to the fight against MG. The MGFA clinical classification divides MG patients into five classes: Class I represents patients with weakness restricted to ocular muscles, while Classes II through V represent generalized MG with severity of symptoms increasing in each Class.

Table of Contents

| | MGFA Clinical Classification |
| --- | --- |
| Class | Symptoms |
| I | Weakness in ocular muscles |
| II | Mild weakness in limb, head and trunk, or respiratory muscles |
| III | Moderate weakness in limb, head and trunk, or respiratory muscles |
| IVa | Severe weakness in non-ocular muscles, predominantly affecting muscles in limb, axial muscles, or both. May also have lesser involvement of oropharyngeal muscles |
| IVb | Severe weakness in non-ocular muscles, predominantly affecting oropharyngeal, respiratory muscles, or both. May also have lesser or equal involvement of limb, axial muscles, or both. |
| V | Requires intubation |

Table of Contents
-----------------

Clinicians have developed a quantitative examination-based scoring system to follow a patient's disease severity called the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis ("QMG score"), which measures muscle weakness. The QMG score is divided into 13 sections, each measuring the weakness of different sets of muscles such as that of outstretched limbs, grip strength, breathing, swallowing, eye movement, speech and neck strength. Each item is assessed on a four-point scale where a score of zero represents no weakness and a score of three represents severe weakness for a maximum total score of 39. Clinicians also use the MG Activities of Daily Living ("MGADL") score, a clinically validated, patient-reported measurement of the severity of MG symptoms. The MG-ADL score measures the effect of MG symptoms on eight functions as reported by the patient, including talking, chewing, swallowing, breathing and vision. Each item is assessed on a three-point scale where a score of zero represents no symptoms and a score of three represents severe symptoms for a maximum total of 24.

Previously completed clinical trials of anti-FcRn antibodies have generated promising results. In a Phase 3 clinical trial conducted by argenx SE to evaluate efgartigimod, an anti-FcRn antibody fragment for the treatment of MG, patients dosed with intravenous drug product demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant responder rate in MG-ADL score compared to those receiving placebo after four weeks of treatment.

The most common target of autoimmune antibodies in MG are the AChR protein within the neuromuscular junction that binds to the acetylcholine neurotransmitter released by the nerve fiber terminal, and muscle-specific kinase ("MuSK"), a tyrosine kinase, which is involved in propagating neuronal signals. Anti-AChR and antiMuSK antibodies are found in approximately 85% and 8% of MG patients, respectively. The presence of these autoimmune antibodies blocks the signaling from neurons to muscles which results in an impaired ability for the muscle to contract or sustain contraction and results in outward signs of muscle weakness and fatigue.

Current Treatment Paradigm
--------------------------

Very early stage MG is symptomatically treated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as pyridostigmine, which block the breakdown of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, thereby increasing its concentration and capacity to activate the muscle. As the disease progresses, patients are typically treated with immunosuppressive agents such as glucocorticoids, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporine. Thymectomy may be indicated for treatment in patients with evidence of a thymoma and can be considered for treatment in some younger patients who do not have evidence of thymoma. As MG becomes more advanced, patients can be treated during exacerbations with IVIg, which provides therapeutic benefit through multiple potential mechanisms including the saturation of FcRn. However, IVIg requires recurrent, burdensome infusions to obtain significant reductions in symptoms, and the large volumes of intravenous fluid associated with the administration of IVIg can lead to significant side effects, including pulmonary edema and renal complications and treatment can be complicated by events associated with intravascular thrombosis.

Physicians direct patients with more advanced chronic disease and patients in times of crisis to therapies that reduce levels of circulating IgG antibodies. One method of reducing IgG levels is to take blood from a patient and physically remove the patient's plasma before returning the red blood cells as well as outside obtained albumin or plasma to the patient in a process called plasma exchange. This is a slow process that typically takes several hours. Furthermore, this process often requires multiple treatment sequences due to limited daily tolerance (a reported mean of six treatments in MG) over a number of days in order to achieve a significant reduction in IgG antibody levels. A variant of this procedure is immunoadsorption, in which bacterial proteins are used to selectively remove IgG antibodies from serum. The table below sets forth an overview of these treatments for MG. The most recent agent approved for MG is eculizumab, a complement C5 inhibitor, the use of which is limited to patients refractory to available therapy with anti-AChR-positive MG. Anti-MuSK antibodies have a low propensity to activate complement proteins, thus C5 inhibition may not be therapeutically relevant in anti-MuSK-positive patients. Studies indicating that patients with MuSK-positive disease are more likely to become treatment refractory thus present an additional unmet need. Approximately 10% of MG patients are refractory to current treatments, while up to 80% fail to achieve complete stable remission.

ASCEND MG Trial
---------------

In August 2019, we initiated dosing in a multi-center, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 2a clinical trial of IMVT-1401 for the treatment of MG. The ASCEND MG trial was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of IMVT-1401 in an anticipated 21 subjects with moderate-tosevere generalized MG symptoms, as defined by MGFA Class II through IVa, and QMG scores greater than or equal to 12. In the ASCEND MG trial, subjects with MG who have confirmed anti-AChR antibodies received one of two dose levels of IMVT-1401 (680 mg or 340 mg) or placebo delivered by subcutaneous injection on a weekly schedule for six weeks followed by a six-week open-label extension period, in which subjects received up to three further injections of IMVT-1401 administered every other week. There were then three follow-up visits during a six-week post-dosing period. The primary endpoints of this trial were assessment of the safety and tolerability of IMVT-1401 and measurement of the changes from baseline in levels of total IgG subclasses and anti-AChR IgG. Secondary endpoints included PK and changes from baseline in various clinical scores such as QMG, MG-ADL and quality of life measures. Exploratory endpoints included assessment of multiple biomarkers including gene expression profiles, pro-inflammatory markers and receptor occupancy.

Trial Design of ASCEND MG Trial
-------------------------------

Table of Contents
-----------------

In August 2020, we reported top-line results from an interim analysis of 15 participants in our ASCEND MG trial. Results from the six-week treatment period included three arms: 340 mg IMVT-1401 weekly (N=5), 680 mg IMVT-1401 weekly (N=5), and placebo (N=5). Initially, the trial had a target enrollment of 21 subjects, however, after taking into consideration the impact of COVID-19 as well as recent data from other anti-FcRn programs that have supported this mechanism in MG, we elected to unblind and report the study with 15 subjects enrolled.

As evaluated in a pre-specified, pooled analysis of 15 subjects who completed Day 42, IMVT-1401-treated subjects (N=10) showed a mean 3.8-point improvement on the MG-ADL scale vs. a mean decline of +0.6 for placebo, a result that was statistically significant (p = 0.039) . IMVT-1401-treated subjects also showed a statistically significant improvement on the Myasthenia Gravis Composite ("MGC") scale, with an average improvement of 8.0 points vs. a mean decline of +1.4 for placebo (p = 0.008) . The MGC scale consists of test items that measure symptoms and signs of MG, with weighted response options. (1) (1)

MG-ADL responder rates, defined as the percentage of subjects showing a > 2-point improvement, were 60% for IMVT-1401-treated subjects vs. 20% for placebo. MGADL deep responder rates, defined in the study as the percentage of subjects showing a > 6-point improvement, were 40% for IMVT-1401-treated subjects vs. 0% for placebo. MGC deep responder rates, defined in the study as the percentage of subjects showing a > 10-point improvement, were 40% for IMVT-1401-treated subjects vs. 0% for placebo.

Consistent with previously reported Phase 1 results, IMVT-1401 was observed to be generally well-tolerated with no serious adverse events ("SAEs"), no withdrawals due to adverse events (AEs), and no imbalance in headaches; as previously disclosed, lipid levels were not measured contemporaneously during the Phase 1 and ASCEND MG Phase 2a clinical trials of IMVT-1401. See "Safety Data " above for further discussion. Mean reductions in total serum IgG from baseline for the 340 mg and 680 mg cohorts were 59% and 76%, respectively.

After the interim analysis, two additional participants enrolled and were randomized. The ASCEND MG trial is now completed. Before the voluntary pause of dosing, we had a favorable end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA on the design of our Phase 3 registrational program in MG and we are planning on advancing our clinical trials for this indication. Based on our integrated safety analysis, we plan to meet with the FDA to propose further development to evaluate additional dosing levels and regimens as well as to include additional safety monitoring and considerations such as lipid and albumin monitoring and incorporating an independent safety monitoring committee. Contingent upon FDA feedback, we plan to initiate a pivotal study in MG late in the calendar year 2021 or early part of the calendar year 2022.

IMVT-1401 for the Treatment of Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia
---------------------------------------------------------------

Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia Overview
-----------------------------------------

WAIHA is a rare hematologic disease in which autoantibodies mediate hemolysis, or the destruction of RBCs. The clinical presentation is variable and most commonly includes non-specific symptoms of anemia such as fatigue, weakness, skin paleness and shortness of breath. Symptoms typically develop chronically over several weeks to months, however rapid progression over a span of days has also been observed.

In severe cases, hemoglobin levels are unable to meet the body's oxygen demand, which can lead to heart attacks, heart failure and even death. Though the exact causes of WAIHA are unknown, roughly half of cases occur in patients with an underlying lymphoproliferative or autoimmune disease, most commonly chronic lymphocytic leukemia, rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus.

In WAIHA, autoantibodies react with surface proteins on RBCs at temperatures at or above 37° Celsius, or normal body temperature. These antibodies are of the IgG subtype in the majority of patients. WAIHA is differentiated from cold autoimmune hemolytic anemia, or cold agglutinin disease, which shares a similar clinical presentation but is triggered by autoantibodies that react at temperatures below 37° Celsius. In WAIHA, antibody-coated RBCs are removed from circulation primarily in the spleen, where they are destroyed by macrophages. Studies have suggested the severity of WAIHA correlates with the amount and potency of autoantibodies present.

Table of Contents
-----------------

The laboratory evaluation of WAIHA begins with a peripheral blood analysis revealing evidence of extravascular hemolysis (spherocytes, low haptoglobin, elevated bilirubin and elevated LDH). In over 97% of cases, patients have a positive direct antiglobulin test, which detects the presence of IgG or complement proteins bound to the surface of RBCs.

The annual incidence of WAIHA in the United States and Europe is estimated at one to three in 100,000 persons. Based on published estimates, we believe that there are approximately 42,000 patients in the United States and 67,000 patients in Europe living with WAIHA. The disease may be more common in females, with some sources suggesting a 2:1 female predominance. Peak incidence occurs during the sixth and seventh decades of life, however, WAIHA can occur in children as well.

Current Treatment Paradigm
--------------------------

High doses of corticosteroids (>1 mg/kg of prednisone) are typically the first-line treatment option for WAIHA and lead to initial disease control in approximately 7085% of cases. Once initial disease control is achieved, doses of steroids are tapered. However, only 33% of patients maintain sustained disease control once steroids are discontinued and, as a result, the majority of patients will require either long-term steroid treatment or additional therapies.

There are few studies to guide which treatment options to use in patients failing corticosteroids. Until recently, splenectomy had been a common second-line treatment option for patients not responding adequately to corticosteroids. The therapeutic benefit of splenectomy is thought to be twofold: first, it eliminates the major site of RBC destruction in WAIHA; second, removal of the spleen reduces the total lymphoid tissue capable of producing autoantibodies. However, because of the lack of reliable predictors of the outcome, morbidity and potential operative complications of splenectomy, rituximab has become the default second-line option despite not being approved for use in WAIHA. In case studies looking at patients with relapsed disease after treatment with steroids, single-agent rituximab led to responses in 65% to 90% of patients. In such a course of treatment, maximal therapeutic effect is not immediate.

Patients with persistent disease despite use of corticosteroids and rituximab may be offered a course of other immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil or azathioprine sirolimus.

IVIg is not routinely used alone for the treatment of WAIHA, however, small case series have suggested some evidence for a therapeutic effect in patients suffering from life-threatening complications of the disease. In these reports, IVIg has been given at high doses (greater than or equal to 1 g/kg per day), and the results have been inconsistent, requiring repeated courses of treatment in at least one case.

RBC transfusions are indicated in patients who require immediate stabilization. Such patients are monitored closely for evidence of a transfusion reaction. In contrast to other treatment modalities that lead to nonspecific suppression of the immune system, IMVT-1401 may offer a more targeted approach for reducing levels of the causative IgG species responsible for most cases of WAIHA. We believe this could provide a favorable therapeutic window and avoid the significant side effects associated with less targeted immunosuppression.

ASCEND WAIHA Trial
------------------

In November 2019, we submitted our IND to the FDA for WAIHA and, in December 2019, our IND was cleared for Phase 2 trial initiation. The ASCEND WAIHA trial will explore the potential of IMVT-1401 to increase hemoglobin levels and assess the safety and tolerability of IMVT-1401 in this population. Subjects in this trial will be treated with one of two doses of IMVT-1401 (680 mg or 340 mg) administered weekly by subcutaneous injection for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint of this trial is the proportion of responders, defined as subjects achieving a hemoglobin level of at least 10 g/dL and at least a 2 g/dL increase from baseline. Secondary endpoints include change from baseline in other hematologic and chemistry parameters, time to response, patient reported outcome measures, total IgG antibodies and IgG antibodies by subclasses.

The ASCEND WAIHA trial is an open label design, so the program-wide pause in dosing resulted in this trial being suspended. During the fall of 2021, we plan to commence discussions with the FDA on re-initiating this study, incorporating safety considerations and risk management as well as additional dosing regimens. We anticipate re-initiating this study based on a favorable outcome from these meetings late in the calendar year 2021 or early part of the calendar year 2022.

IMVT-1401 for the Treatment of Thyroid Eye Disease
--------------------------------------------------

Thyroid Eye Disease Overview
----------------------------

TED, also referred to as GO, is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder that affects the muscles and other tissues around the eyes, which can be sight-threatening. Initial symptoms may include a dry and gritty ocular sensation, sensitivity to light, excessive tearing, double vision and a sensation of pressure behind the eyes. By the time that TED is clinically diagnosed, many patients have retraction of their upper eyelids, swelling and redness surrounding the eyes and protrusion of the eyes. In some cases, swelling and stiffness of the muscles that move the eyes cause the eyes to no longer line up with each other or for the eyelids to no longer be able to close. Approximately 3% to 5% of TED patients have a severe manifestation of the disease, with intense pain, inflammation and sight-threatening corneal ulcers or optic neuropathy that requires surgical intervention. Decompression surgery to improve ocular function or rehabilitative surgery to improve quality of life is required in up to 20% of TED patients.

TED is most commonly caused by IgG autoantibodies that form against the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor ("TSHR"). These antibodies activate certain cell types, such as fibroblasts and adipocytes, present in the extraocular space, which are known to highly express TSHR. The activation of these fibroblasts causes them to proliferate and to produce hyaluronan, a substance that contributes directly to the swelling associated with TED. Hyaluronan also serves as an inflammatory signal leading to the synthesis of cytokines that cause recruitment of lymphocytes and extensive tissue inflammation and remodeling. Exposure to other inflammatory agents, such as cigarette smoke, lead to exacerbation of the disease resulting in more severe symptoms. Anti-TSHR antibodies also increase the proliferation of adipose or fat cells as well as myofibroblasts, smooth muscle-like cells. Levels of anti-TSHR autoantibodies correlate positively with clinical features of TED and influence its prognosis.

In addition to anti-TSHR autoantibodies, antibodies that activate the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor ("IGF1R") have been described in the literature. TSHR and IGF1R have functional overlaps and stimulation of either receptor may lead to activation of similar biochemical pathways in certain cell types, including the ones implicated in TED. Published studies investing this pathway have led to the discovery that the IGF1R and TSHR form a receptor complex where IGF1R can augment the signaling of TSHR. The exact nature of the interaction between IGF1R and TSHR continues to be investigated; however, experimental evidence suggests that the effects of TSHR stimulating antibodies are only partially blocked by an IGF1R antagonist while they may be completely blocked with a TSHR antagonist.

TED has an estimated annual incidence of 16 in 100,000 women and 2.9 in 100,000 men in North America and Europe. The natural history of TED begins with an inflammatory phase lasting between six and 24 months that is characterized by lymphocyte infiltration, fibroblast proliferation and increases in adipose tissue. The first line of treatment for TED patients is generally immunosuppressive therapy, including high doses of corticosteroids. Treatment of patients with immunosuppressive therapies during this active inflammatory phase can lead to reduction in symptoms and can alter the course of the disease. However, once the initial inflammatory phase is over, immunosuppressive therapies are ineffective and levels of fibrosis that have developed as the result of acute inflammation are only reversible by surgery. We estimate that 15,000 to 20,000 patients in the United States have active inflammatory TED and are eligible for treatment.

Trial Design of ASCEND WAIHA Trial
----------------------------------

Table of Contents
-----------------

Clinicians use the CAS to measure disease activity in TED patients. CAS is based on seven parameters, including spontaneous pain behind the eye, pain with eye movement, redness of the eyelids, redness of the conjunctiva, swelling of the eyelids, swelling of the caruncle and swelling of the conjunctiva. A score is calculated based on the number of parameters that are positive with scores of four or above considered to be cases of active disease. Changes in disease severity over time are determined by changes in proptosis, or protrusion of the eyeball, eye movements and visual acuity.

Relationship between TED and Graves' Disease
--------------------------------------------

TED often develops in parallel with Graves' disease, a related but clinically distinct autoimmune disease. In Graves' disease, anti-TSHR autoantibodies cause the thyroid to become overactive, resulting in a condition called hyperthyroidism, in which the thyroid overproduces thyroid hormone. If left untreated, hyperthyroidism can cause serious problems with the heart, bones, muscles, menstrual cycle and fertility.

A close temporal relationship exists between the onset of Graves' disease and the onset of TED. Regardless of which condition occurs first, in 80% of patients, the other condition develops within 18 months. Approximately one in 20 patients with Graves' disease present with moderate-to-severe TED, which is characterized by swelling and redness of eyelids, proptosis, double vision and, in severe cases, corneal ulceration and decreased visual acuity. Graves' disease can be treated with antithyroid drugs or removal of the thyroid through a procedure called a thyroidectomy. While some studies of these treatments have shown autoimmune antibodies decreasing or disappearing with treatment, others have shown no change in antibody levels after treatment.

Current Treatment Paradigm
--------------------------

As a first option, patients with active TED are treated with immunosuppressive therapy such as high-doses of corticosteroids, typically administered intravenously or orally. Corticosteroids are not effective in all patients, and approximately one-third of patients will relapse. This therapy is associated with an increased risk of acute and severe organ damage, bone thinning, weight gain, diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis and depression. In January 2020, the FDA approved Horizon Therapeutics' Tepezza (teprotumumab), an anti-IGF-1R antibody, for the treatment of TED.

Orbital radiation therapy is used as a means of reducing the infiltration of lymphocytes and can be used in conjunction with corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapy. Similar to these anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs, radiation therapy is most effective in the active stage of TED.

Patients with moderate-to-severe active TED which is still in the active stage and who do not respond adequately to corticosteroids can be treated with cyclosporine or mycophenolate mofetil, two broad immunosuppressive drugs. These powerful drugs are associated with numerous side effects related both to their general immunosuppressive effects as well as to inherent toxicities, such as hypertension, kidney disease and gastrointestinal toxicity.

Small case studies have identified rituximab as an alternate way of inducing immunosuppression in patients with TED. Rituximab (Roche) is a monoclonal antibody that binds to an antigen specific to B cells, leading to their destruction. However, rituximab is associated with the potential for serious side effects, such as infusion-related reactions. Rare cases of progressive multifocal encephalopathy and other viral infections have also been reported.

Surgery is considered to be a treatment option in patients with a high CAS who have been treated with corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapy but continue to have progressive disease. The goal of surgery is to reduce the pressure causing proptosis, reduced eye movement and loss of visual acuity. Because of its invasive nature, surgery is typically reserved for inactive disease.

We believe that a therapy for TED focused on addressing the cause of the disease, namely the presence of autoimmune antibodies, represents an attractive approach that has the potential to avoid many of the serious side effects of current therapies. In previously conducted third-party studies, levels of autoimmune antibodies were reduced through plasmapheresis and IVIg and resulted in therapeutic benefit. We expect that IMVT-1401 has the potential to deliver similar benefits. Because the mode of action of IMVT-1401 is independent of the antigen recognized by the autoimmune antibodies, we believe that IMVT-1401 can address TED that arises through any IgG autoantibody mechanism whether it be anti-TSHR, anti-IGF1R, or any other IgG autoantibodies.

ASCEND GO-1 Trial
-----------------

In May 2019, we initiated dosing in our ASCEND GO-1 trial, an open label single-arm Phase 2a clinical trial of IMVT-1401 in Canada in patients with TED. We announced initial results from this trial in March 2020. The trial is now completed. Subjects recruited for this trial have moderate-to-severe active TED with confirmed autoantibodies to TSHR. A total of seven subjects were dosed weekly with subcutaneous injections for six weeks. The trial utilized an induction and maintenance strategy, using only subcutaneous injections. Subjects received a 680 mg dose for the first two weekly administrations of the study drug followed by a 340 mg dose weekly for the final four administrations. The primary endpoints of this trial were safety and tolerability of IMVT-1401 over the six-week treatment period, as well as the change from baseline in levels of anti-TSHR antibodies, total IgG antibodies and IgG antibodies by subclasses. Secondary clinical endpoints included mean changes in proptosis, or protrusion of the eyeball, the proptosis responder rate, defined as the percentage of subjects with a greater than or equal to 2 mm reduction in proptosis in the study eye without deterioration in the fellow eye, PK and anti-drug antibodies. Exploratory endpoints included assessment of change from baseline in the CAS, change from baseline in the Gorman diplopia score, multiple biomarkers including gene expression profiles, pro-inflammatory markers, receptor occupancy and changes as measured by computerized tomography (CT) scans.

---------------------------------

All seven subjects completed the six-week treatment phase of the trial and entered the 12-week follow-up phase. Mean reduction in total IgG levels from baseline to end of treatment was 65%. As evaluated at the end of treatment, four of seven subjects (57%) improved by ≥ 2 points on the CAS. Of six subjects with baseline diplopia, four subjects (67%) demonstrated improvement in diplopia. Three of seven subjects (43%) were proptosis responders. The safety and tolerability profile observed was consistent with the prior Phase 1 trial of IMVT-1401 in 99 healthy volunteers; as previously disclosed, lipid levels were not measured contemporaneously during the Phase 1 and ASCEND GO-1 Phase 2a clinical trials of IMVT-1401. Mean albumin reduction from baseline to end of treatment was 24%. All AEs were mild or moderate. See "Safety Data " above for further discussion.

ASCEND GO-2 Trial
-----------------

In October 2019, we initiated dosing in our ASCEND GO-2 trial, a randomized, masked, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial in 77 subjects with moderate-tosevere active TED with confirmed autoantibodies to TSHR. The ASCEND GO-2 trial explored the potential of IMVT-1401 to improve proptosis and assesses the safety and tolerability of IMVT-1401 in this population. Subjects in this trial were treated with one of three doses of IMVT-1401 (680 mg, 340 mg or 255 mg) or placebo administered weekly by subcutaneous injection for 12 weeks. The primary endpoints of this trial were the proptosis responder rate measured at week 13, defined as the percentage of subjects with a greater than or equal to 2 mm reduction in proptosis in the study eye without deterioration in the fellow eye, and safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints included the proptosis responder rate measured at weeks 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 20, the proportion of subjects with a CAS of 0 or 1, the mean change from baseline in proptosis, CAS, diplopia, ophthalmic improvement and GO-QOL and PK, PD, defined as anti-TSHR antibodies and total IgG and IgG antibodies by subclasses, and anti-drug antibodies. Exploratory endpoints included assessment of CT-measured muscle volume, fat volume, total orbital volume and proptosis, as well as multiple biomarkers including gene expression profiles, pro-inflammatory markers and receptor occupancy.

Our voluntary pause in dosing resulted in unblinding the ASCEND GO-2 trial. As a result, following the last patient last visit of the post-treatment follow-up period, the ASCEND GO-2 trial was terminated. Treatment with IMVT-1401 reduced both IgG and disease specific pathogenic IgG over the 12-week treatment period. However, the efficacy results, based on approximately half the anticipated number of subjects who had reached the week 13 primary efficacy analysis at the time of the termination of the trial, were inconclusive. The primary endpoint of the proportion of proptosis responders was not met, and although not tested statistically, post hoc evaluation of other endpoints measured (CAS and diplopia scores) indicated the desired magnitude of treatment effect likely would not have been achieved. However, levels of IgG were reduced across IMVT-1401 dosing groups, and analysis of the receptor occupancy data suggest binding of IMVT-1401 to the Fc receptor. Additional exploratory work on other disease biomarkers is under evaluation. Further discussions with external experts are ongoing to determine whether a specific population can be identified to optimize the clinical performance of IMVT-1401. Based on these analyses, we are likely to design another Phase 2 trial in TED or another thyroid-related disease as our next study in this therapeutic area and initiate discussions with regulatory authorities before the end of the calendar year 2021.

In December 2017, Roivant Sciences GmbH ("RSG"), a wholly owned subsidiary of RSL, entered into a license agreement with HanAll, or the HanAll Agreement. Under the HanAll Agreement, RSG received (1) the non-exclusive right to manufacture and (2) the exclusive, royalty-bearing right to develop, import and use the antibody referred to as IMVT-1401 and certain back-up and next-generation antibodies, and products containing such antibodies, and to commercialize such products, in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the E.U., the U.K., Switzerland, the Middle East, North Africa and Latin America, or the Licensed Territory, for all human and animal uses, during the term of the agreement. With respect to these licenses, RSG also received the right to grant a sublicense, with prior written notice to HanAll of such sublicense, to: (1) a third party in any country in the Licensed Territory outside of the United States and E.U.; (2) an affiliate of RSG in any country in the Licensed Territory; and (3) a third party in the United States and E.U. only after submission of a biologics license application ("BLA") in the United States or a Marketing Authorization Application in the E.U. Pursuant to the HanAll Agreement, RSG granted to HanAll an exclusive, royalty-free license under certain RSG patents, knowhow and other intellectual property controlled by RSG relating to such antibodies and products to develop, manufacture and commercialize such antibodies and products for use outside of the Licensed Territory. HanAll also reserves the right to conduct discovery or research activities with the IMVT-1401 antibody, and certain back-up and next-generation antibodies, with or through a contract research organization or service provider in the Licensed Territory.

In December 2018, we obtained and assumed all rights, title, interest and obligations under the HanAll Agreement from RSG, including all rights to IMVT-1401 from RSG in the Licensed Territory, pursuant to an assignment and assumption agreement between RSG and its wholly owned subsidiary, Immunovant Sciences GmbH, or ISG, for an aggregate purchase price of $37.8 million plus Swiss value-added tax of $2.9 million.

Under the HanAll Agreement, the parties may choose to collaborate on a research program directed to the research and development of next generation FcRn inhibitors in accordance with an agreed plan and budget. We are obligated to reimburse HanAll for half of such research and development expenses incurred by HanAll, up to an aggregate reimbursement amount of $20.0 million. Intellectual property created by HanAll pursuant to this research program will be included in our license; intellectual property created by us pursuant to this research program will be included in HanAll's license. Since the acquisition of IMVT-1401, we, along with RSL, have performed all the development associated with IMVT-1401 and no amounts were incurred by HanAll and reported to the Company for further research or development of the technology for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.

Pursuant to the HanAll Agreement, RSG made an upfront payment of $30.0 million to HanAll. In May 2019, we achieved our first development and regulatory milestone, which resulted in a $10.0 million milestone payment that we subsequently paid in August 2019. We will be responsible for future contingent payments and royalties, including up to an aggregate of $442.5 million upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales milestone events. We are also obligated to pay HanAll tiered royalties ranging from the mid-single digits to mid-teens on net sales of licensed products, subject to standard offsets and reductions as set forth in the HanAll Agreement. These royalty obligations apply on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis and end upon the latest of: (A) the date on which the last valid claim of the licensed patents expire, (B) the date on which the data or market exclusivity expires or (C) 11 years after the first commercial sale of the licensed product, in each case, with respect to a given product in a given country.

Except for cost-sharing in connection with the research program, we are solely responsible, at our expense, for all other activities related to the research, development and commercialization of licensed products for the Licensed Territory. We may use a third party for manufacturing activities necessary for the research, development and commercialization of licensed products for the Licensed Territory. In addition, under the HanAll Agreement, we have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize licensed products in the Licensed Territory. Each party has agreed that neither it nor certain of its affiliates will clinically develop or commercialize certain competitive products in the Licensed Territory.

Under the HanAll Agreement, we have the sole right, but not the obligation, to control the prosecution, defense and enforcement of the licensed patents in the Licensed Territory, and HanAll has backup rights to prosecution, defense and enforcement with respect to any licensed patents for which we elect not to exercise such rights.

Table of Contents
-----------------

The HanAll Agreement will expire on a product-by-product basis on the expiration of the last royalty term with respect to a given licensed product, unless earlier terminated. We may terminate the HanAll Agreement in its entirety without cause upon 180 days' written notice following 30 days of discussion. Either party may terminate the HanAll Agreement upon 60 days' written notice for uncured material breach (or 30 days in the case of non-payment), or immediately upon written notice if the other party files a voluntary petition, is subject to a substantiated involuntary petition or for certain other solvency events. HanAll may terminate the HanAll Agreement if we or our affiliates challenge the validity or enforceability of any of the licensed patents.

Services Agreements with RSI and RSG
------------------------------------

In August 2018, we entered into services agreements with Roivant Sciences Inc. ("RSI") and RSG, collectively the Services Agreements, under which RSI and RSG agreed to provide services related to development, administrative and financial activities to us during our formative period. Under each Services Agreement, we will pay or reimburse RSI or RSG, as applicable, for any expenses they, or third parties acting on our behalf, incur. For any general and administrative and research and development activities performed by RSI or RSG employees, RSI or RSG, as applicable, will charge back the employee compensation expense plus a pre-determined markup. RSI and RSG also provided such services prior to the formalization of the Services Agreements, and such costs have been recognized by us in the period in which the services were rendered. Employee compensation expense, inclusive of base salary and fringe benefits, is determined based upon the relative percentage of time utilized on our matters. All other costs will be billed back at cost. The term of the Services Agreements will continue until terminated by us, RSI or RSG, as applicable, upon 90 days' written notice.

RSL Information Sharing and Cooperation Agreement
-------------------------------------------------

In December 2018, we entered into an amended and restated information sharing and cooperation agreement, or the Cooperation Agreement with RSL, which, among other things: (1) obligates us to deliver to RSL periodic financial statements and other information upon reasonable request and to comply with other specified financial reporting requirements; (2) requires us to supply certain material information to RSL to assist it in preparing any future SEC filings; and (3) requires us to implement and observe certain policies and procedures related to applicable laws and regulations. We have agreed to indemnify RSL and its affiliates and their respective officers, employees and directors against all losses arising out of, due to or in connection with RSL's status as a stockholder under the Cooperation Agreement and the operations of or services provided by RSL or its affiliates or their respective officers, employees or directors to us or any of our subsidiaries, subject to certain limitations set forth in the Cooperation Agreement. No amounts have been paid or received under this agreement; however, we believe this agreement is material to our business and operations.

Subject to specified exceptions, the Cooperation Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (1) the mutual written consent of the parties or (2) the later of when RSL no longer (a) is required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, to consolidate our results of operations and financial position, account for its investment in us under the equity method of accounting or, by any rule of the SEC, include our separate financial statements in any filings it may make with the SEC and (b) has the right to elect directors constituting a majority of our board of directors.

We are a Member of the Roivant Family of Companies
--------------------------------------------------

We are a majority-owned subsidiary of RSL and have benefited from our ability to leverage the Roivant model and the greater Roivant platform. The period of time between our formation and operational maturation was shortened based on the support from centralized Roivant functions available since creation. This includes operational functions as well as access to Roivant's proprietary technology and digital innovation platforms. Consistent with its model, Roivant has also provided us with access to an embedded team of scientific experts, physicians and technologists to help optimize clinical development and commercial strategies. In the future, we may have the ability to benefit from Roivant's economies of scale and scope, including but not limited to the opportunity to:

* · leverage Roivant's business development engine and vast network of industry relationships for the identification of, and access to, new assets and synergistic partnerships;
* · enter channel partnerships with other members of the Roivant family of companies (including but not limited to technology-focused companies built by Roivant), with the goal of delivering efficiencies in the development and commercialization process;
* · access Roivant's human capital engine to recruit new employees from within and beyond the biopharmaceutical industry;

-----------------

* · enable its employees to participate in Roivant's career development program which facilitates employee mobility across members of the Roivant family of companies;
* · benefit from shared learnings, best practices, and external industry relationships across the Roivant family of companies; and
* · derive certain benefits of scale upon becoming a commercial-stage company.

For a discussion on RSL's significant ownership of our shares of common stock and related possible risks, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors, "RSL owns a significant percentage of shares of our common stock and may exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval."

Sales and Marketing
-------------------

We do not currently have our own marketing, sales or distribution capabilities. In order to commercialize IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate, if approved for commercial sale, we would have to develop a sales and marketing infrastructure. We intend to build a small, targeted sales organization in the United States, targeting specialist physicians that treat high numbers of patients with autoimmune conditions. We believe these physicians treat a majority of patients with the autoimmune indications that we intend to target and most often serve as the diagnosing and treating physicians for such indications. We may opportunistically seek strategic collaborations to maximize the commercial opportunities for IMVT-1401 or any future product candidates inside and outside the United States.

Manufacturing
-------------

We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of clinical or commercial quantities of IMVT-1401, and there are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under the FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practice ("cGMP") requirements (particularly for the development of antibodies) that might be capable of manufacturing for us. We currently rely and intend to continue to rely on contract manufacturing organizations ("CMOs"), for both drug substance and drug product. Currently, we contract with well-established third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of our drug substance and our drug product. We expect to engage additional third-party manufacturers to support any pivotal clinical trials for IMVT-1401 as well as commercialization of IMVT-1401, if approved, in the United States or other jurisdictions. In addition, we continue to augment the organization by recruiting personnel with experience to manage the CMOs producing our product candidate and other product candidates or products that we may develop in the future.

Our outsourced approach to manufacturing relies on CMOs to first develop cell lines and manufacturing processes that are compliant with cGMP then produce material for nonclinical studies and clinical trials. Our agreements with CMOs may obligate them to develop a production cell line, establish master and working cell banks, develop and qualify upstream and downstream processes, develop drug product process, validate (and in some cases develop) suitable analytical methods for test and release as well as stability testing, produce drug substance for nonclinical testing, produce cGMP-compliant drug substance, or produce cGMP-compliant drug product. We conduct audits of CMOs prior to initiation of activities under these agreements and monitor operations to ensure compliance with the mutually agreed process descriptions and cGMP regulations.

Competition
-----------

We expect to face intense competition from other biopharmaceutical companies who are developing agents for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including multiple agents which are in the same class as IMVT-1401. We are aware of several FcRn inhibitors that are in clinical development. These include efgartigimod (argenx SE), nipocalimab (Johnson & Johnson), rozanolixizumab (UCB) and ALXN1830 (Alexion Pharmaceuticals). Each of efgartigimod, nipocalimab, and rozanolixizumab is currently under development for the treatment of MG. Alexion has announced plans to begin Phase 2 trials for ALXN1830 in MG and WAIHA in the second half of 2021. Johnson & Johnson is currently running a Phase 2/3 clinical study for nipocalimab in WAIHA. Johnson & Johnson also announced that the FDA has granted Fast Track Designation for nipocalimab in WAIHA.

In a Phase 1 trial conducted by argenx SE, efgartigimod was observed to reduce mean IgG levels by approximately 50% after two 20 mg/kg intravenous induction doses followed by eight weekly 300 mg subcutaneous doses. In a Phase 2 trial conducted in MG, UCB's rozanolixizumab was infused subcutaneously, over 30 minutes, and was observed to reduce mean IgG levels by approximately 56% and approximately 68% after three and six weekly 7 mg/kg infusions, respectively. Johnson & Johnson's nipocalimab is in clinical development with a subcutaneous formulation. Clinical results for Alexion's subcutaneous formulation of ALXN1830 are not available.

-----------------

IMVT-1401, if approved, may also face competition from agents with different mechanisms of action. In January 2020, the FDA approved Horizon Therapeutics' Tepezza (teprotumumab), an anti-IGF-1R antibody, for the treatment of TED. The most commonly prescribed first-line agents for the treatment of MG are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as pyridostigmine, which are marketed by several manufacturers of generic medicines. IVIg is also routinely used for patients with MG. Eculizumab (marketed by Alexion), an antibody inhibitor of the C5 protein, was approved in 2017 for the treatment of generalized MG in patients who are positive for anti-AChR antibodies. The first line of treatment for TED and WAIHA patients is generally immunosuppressive therapy, including high doses of corticosteroids. Other broad immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine, are used when patients do not respond adequately to corticosteroids. Rituximab (Roche), a monoclonal antibody that binds to an antigen specific to antibody-producing B cells, may also be used as a treatment for TED, WAIHA and other IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases. Johnson & Johnson is developing its hypersialylated IVIg, M254, in a variety of autoimmune indications. Other product candidates in development for the treatment of MG include: zilucoplan (UCB), a peptide inhibitor of C5, inebilizumab (Horizon Therapeutics), a CD19-targeted humanized monoclonal antibody, and Ravulizumab-cwvz (Alexion), an antibody inhibitor of the C5 protein, all of which are currently in Phase 3 trials.

Numerous product candidates are currently in development for the treatment of WAIHA. Fostamatinib (Rigel Pharmaceuticals), a syk inhibitor, is currently in Phase 3 development for the treatment of WAIHA. A Phase 2 investigator-initiated study of ibrutinib (AbbVie), a BTK inhibitor, in steroid-refractory WAIHA is ongoing. Annexon Biosciences plans to initiate a Phase 2 trial for WAIHA in 2021 for ANX005, an antibody inhibitor of the C1q protein.

Drug development is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological advancements. Our ability to compete will significantly depend upon its ability to complete necessary clinical trials and regulatory approval processes, and effectively market any drug that it may successfully develop. Our current and potential future competitors include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic institutions and government agencies. The primary competitive factors that will affect the commercial success of any product candidate for which we may receive marketing approval include efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, dosing convenience, price, coverage, reimbursement and public opinion. Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, as well as in obtaining regulatory approvals of those product candidates in the United States and in foreign countries. Our current and potential future competitors also have significantly more experience commercializing drugs that have been approved for marketing. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and gene therapy industries could result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our competitors.

Accordingly, competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining regulatory approval for therapies and in achieving widespread market acceptance of their drugs. It is also possible that the development of a cure or more effective treatment method for any of our targeted indications by a competitor could render our product candidate non-competitive or obsolete, or reduce the demand for its product candidate before it can recover its development and commercialization expenses.

Intellectual Property
---------------------

Our commercial success depends in part on its ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for IMVT-1401 and any of its future product candidates, novel discoveries, product development technologies and know-how; to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others; and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing or in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.

While we seek broad coverage under our existing patent applications, there is always a risk that an alteration to any products we develop or processes we use may provide sufficient basis for a competitor to avoid infringing our patent claims. In addition, patents, if granted, expire and we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or any future applications or that any potentially issued patents will adequately protect our products or product candidates.

-----------------

Following our assumption of all rights, title, interest and obligations under the HanAll Agreement from RSG in December 2018, by virtue of the license of patent rights under the HanAll Agreement, we are the exclusive licensee of a patent family directed to IMVT-1401, and certain back-up and next-generation antibodies, and products containing such antibodies, in the Licensed Territory. As of May 28, 2021, this licensed patent family includes pending patent applications and/or issued patent(s) in the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, European Patent Office, Egypt, Israel, Mexico and Saudi Arabia. This in-licensed patent family discloses anti-FcRn antibodies, pharmaceutical compositions thereof, methods of treating autoimmune disease using the same, polynucleotides encoding such antibodies, expression vectors including such polynucleotides, host cells transfected with such recombinant expression vectors, methods of manufacturing such antibodies and methods of detecting FcRn in vivo or in vitro using such antibodies. Notably, in the in-licensed patent family, a U.S. patent was issued on July 2, 2019, with claims directed to an isolated anti-FcRn antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof, and a pharmaceutical composition comprising such antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof. Furthermore, another U.S. patent was issued in this in-licensed patent family on January 28, 2020, with claims directed to an isolated anti-FcRn antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof, a pharmaceutical composition comprising such antibody or antigen-binding fragment thereof as well as methods of treating various autoimmune diseases using the antibody, polynucleotides and expression vectors encoding the antibody, host cells capable of expressing the antibody and methods of producing the antibody. Additionally, as of May 28, 2021, independent of the licensed patent family, ISG has a patent family directed to methods of treating thyroid eye disease using anti-FcRn antibodies that includes patent applications in the United States as well as foreign counterparts in certain jurisdictions within its Licensed Territory and another patent family that includes an internationally filed patent application directed to methods of treating warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia using anti-FcRn antibodies. Generally, the term of any patent granted from a patent application in the in-licensed HanAll patent family directed to the IMVT-1401 composition of matter and methods of use has a projected natural expiration and will expire on April 30, 2035 in the United States, subject to such terms as may be modified by, for example, terminal disclaimer or any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular jurisdiction.

In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date, as the term of a patent granted on a utility patent application filed after June 8, 1995 expires 20 years after the non-provisional U.S. filing date (or any earlier filing date relied upon under 35 U.S.C. 120, 121, or 365(c)), with the timely payment of maintenance fees. In certain instances, the patent term may be adjusted to add additional days to compensate for certain delays incurred by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ("USPTO") in the examination process, issuing the patent and/or the patent term may be extended for a period of time to compensate for at least a portion of the time a product candidate was undergoing FDA regulatory review. However, the patent extension granted for FDA regulatory review is only applied to a single patent that covers either the product candidate or a method of using or manufacturing the same which has not expired at the time of FDA approval. Additionally, the period of time the patent is extended may not exceed five years, and the total patent term, including the period of time the patent is extended, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. The protection afforded by a patent with respect to a particular product varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in the particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent under the local laws. ISG owns a trademark for IMMUNOVANT, the corporate logo, and a composite trademark for its corporate logo with the IMMUNOVANT mark. As of May 28, 2021, this trademark portfolio includes pending trademark applications and/or registered trademarks in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Under the HanAll Agreement, we have the right to market IMVT-1401 in the Licensed Territory under the trademark(s) of our choice, subject to regulatory approval. However, upon termination of the HanAll Agreement, we must assign to HanAll all right, title and interest in and to any and all trademarks we use in the development, manufacture or commercialization of the licensed products.

Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by using confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with its commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant it ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.

Table of Contents
-----------------

Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter its development or commercial strategies for our product candidates or processes, or to obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that it may require to develop or commercialize its future products may have an adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention.

Government Regulation
---------------------

The FDA and other regulatory health authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in foreign countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various nonclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies and health authorities of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate.

FDA Drug Approval Process
-------------------------

In the United States, the FDA regulates biologics under both the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Services Act and their implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

* · completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with applicable regulations and guidance, including the FDA's current Good Laboratory Practices ("GLP") regulations, International Council for Harmonisation ("ICH") guidance, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
* · submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated at least annually or when significant changes are made;
* · approval by an institutional review board ("IRB") or ethics committee for each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
* · conduct of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, Good Clinical Practice ("GCP"), and other clinical-trial related regulations and guidance to evaluate the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for each proposed indication;
* · preparation of and submission to the FDA of a BLA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials that includes manufacturing information and substantial evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
* · a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review;
* · satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product's continued safety, purity and potency;
* · potential FDA audit of selected clinical investigation sites, preclinical studies, and/or Immunovant as clinical trial sponsor to assess compliance with FDA's GCP standards;
* · payment of user fees for FDA review of the BLA (unless a fee waiver applies);
* · agreement with FDA on the final labeling for the product and the design and implementation of any required Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ("REMS"); and
* · FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA, including satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable, to permit commercial marketing or sale of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.

-----------------

Our product candidates are being developed to be registered as pre-filled syringes and autoinjectors, which means that they are subject to regulation as combination products because they are composed of both a biologic product and device product. If approved and marketed individually, each component would be subject to different regulatory pathways and reviewed by different centers within the FDA. A combination product, however, is assigned to a center that will have primary jurisdiction over its regulation based on a determination of the combination product's primary mode of action, which is the single mode of action that provides the most important therapeutic action. In the case of our product candidates, the primary mode of action is attributable to the biologic component of the product, which means that the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research has primary jurisdiction over the premarket development, review and approval of our product candidates. Accordingly, our product candidates are subject to the IND framework for premarket development and approval through the BLA pathway. Based on our understanding of FDA's combination device expectations, we do not anticipate that the FDA will require a separate medical device authorization for the syringe, but this could change during the course of its review of any marketing application that we may submit.

European Union Drug Approval Process
------------------------------------

In the European Union (the "E.U."), there are three existing regulatory procedures for a medicinal product to be authorized for use in the Member States of the E.U. and the European Economic Area under the E.U. pharmaceutical legislation that harmonizes the regulatory standards and requirements for assessing safety, quality and efficacy.

A medicinal product for human use may be authorized either by the European Commission through the centralized procedure or by national competent authorities through a mutual recognition, decentralized or national procedure. We have focused on the centralized procedure as we expect it to be the relevant procedure for our product candidates.

The centralized procedure applies to a medicinal product for human use containing a new active substance which was not authorized in the E.U. for which the therapeutic indication is the treatment of any of the following diseases: acquired immune deficiency syndrome, cancer, neurodegenerative disorder, diabetes, auto-immune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, and viral diseases. In addition, the following product categories must also be centrally authorized: a medicinal product developed by means of recombinant DNA technology, controlled expression of genes coding for biologically active proteins in prokaryotes and eukaryotes including transformed mammalian cells and hybridoma and monoclonal antibody methods. A medicinal product that has been designated as an orphan medicinal product must also be evaluated through the centralized procedure. A medicinal product that is considered as constituting a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or its approval is in the interests of E.U. patients is also eligible for the optional centralized assessment. The centralized procedure requires applicants to submit an application for marketing authorization to the European Medicines Agency ("EMA") which is responsible for the coordinating the scientific assessment to be performed by its relevant advisory committees, including the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). Once a positive opinion is adopted by the CHMP, the European Commission will issue a binding decision on granting the centralized marketing authorization which is valid throughout the Member States of the E.U. and the European Economic Area (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein).

A reference medicinal product approved via the centralized procedure receives a period of 10 years data and market protection or exclusivity upon grant of a marketing authorization. This period is divided into eight years of data protection within which no generic applicant including a biosimilar applicant can cross-reference the nonclinical and clinical data contained in the file of the reference medicinal product. Even if an authorization is granted based on data cross-referencing, the follow-on manufacturer cannot market the product for two further years (the period of market protection). This period can be extended to a total period of 11 years if during the first eight years of the protection period one or more new therapeutic indications are determined, during the regulatory review, to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies and the indication application is approved.

On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (the "U.K.") left the E.U. (commonly referred to as "Brexit") and accordingly is no longer a Member State. A transition period began on February 1, 2020, during which E.U. pharmaceutical law remained applicable to the U.K., which ended on December 31, 2020. Since the regulatory framework in the U.K. covering the quality, safety and efficacy of medicinal products, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of medicinal products is derived from E.U. regulations, Brexit has materially impacted, and could further materially impact, the regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the U.K., as U.K. legislation now has the potential to diverge from E.U. legislation. It remains to be seen how Brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the U.K. in the long-term. As the U.K. is no longer an E.U. Member State, the U.K.'s participation in the European Medicines Regulatory Network has ceased and the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ("MHRA") has assumed the functions that were previously undertaken by the E.U. for human medicines on the U.K. market (with the exception of Northern Ireland, which, pursuant to the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland has remained aligned with E.U. regulations). The MHRA has recently published detailed guidance for industry and organizations to follow from January 1, 2021 now the transition period is over, which will be updated as the U.K.'s regulatory position on medicinal products evolves over time.

Table of Contents
-----------------

The MHRA offers new assessment procedures for applications for products containing new active substances and biosimilars. The procedures can lead to a marketing authorization in Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales), the United Kingdom, or Northern Ireland, depending on the procedure and pre-existing authorizations, as further explained below. The new assessments include:

* · The European Commission Decision Reliance Procedure will be in place until January 1, 2023 and is a targeted assessment of new applications for products containing new active substances or biosimilars under review via the centralized procedure with EMA. MHRA will review the application, CHMP assessment report, and applicant responses to CHMP within 67 days. Should that review be successful, it will lead to the grant of a marketing authorization in Great Britain, the centralized marketing authorization in the E.U. will already permit the marketing of the relevant product in Northern Ireland;
* · A full assessment as a national authorization can be chosen for new active substances, with a timeline of no more than 150 days (excluding clock-off periods where further information is requested) which can lead to the grant of a marketing authorization in Great Britain, the U.K., or Northern Ireland. If the application includes Northern Ireland then it must comply with the relevant E.U. requirements;
* · The Unfettered Access Procedure for medicines already approved in Northern Ireland via the E.U. procedures or via the Northern Ireland national route which if successful will lead to a Great Britain marketing authorization; and
* · A 'rolling review', for new active substances and biosimilars, which allows companies to make an application in stages, throughout the product's development, to better manage development risk which can lead to the grant of a marketing authorization in Great Britain, the U.K., or Northern Ireland. If the application includes Northern Ireland then it must comply with the relevant E.U. requirements.

Nonclinical and Clinical Development
------------------------------------

Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The IND includes the clinical protocols and general development plan, as well as results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, PK, pharmacology and PD characteristics of the product candidate; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold until the IND sponsor and the FDA resolve the outstanding concerns or questions. The FDA also may impose clinical holds at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Submission of an IND therefore does not guarantee that FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial will be granted or that, once begun, issues will not arise that adversely impact, suspend or terminate such studies.

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical study. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development and for any subsequent protocol amendments and additional information such as toxicology or Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls ("CMC") data in support of the investigational product(s). For new indications, a separate new IND is usually required. Outside of the U.S., clinical trial applications are generally required to conduct clinical studies in each country. Furthermore, an independent IRB for each site proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial begins at that site, and must monitor the study until completed to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. Regulatory authorities, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk or that the trial is unlikely to meet its stated objectives. Some studies also include oversight by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical study sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or independent data monitoring committee, which provides direction for whether or not a study may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the study and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical studies and clinical study results to public registries. Information about most clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website. For purposes of BLA/MAA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined.

Table of Contents
-----------------

* · Phase 1 - The investigational product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, tolerability, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on pharmacodynamics and effectiveness.
* · Phase 2 - The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
* · Phase 3 - The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple global clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to support chronic use of a product during marketing.

In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA or, in certain circumstances, mandated after approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting or in some cases to support full approval for products that are approved via an accelerated pathway as described below. During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA, and IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA, other regulators, and investigators within a regulated timeframe for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. The FDA may require such testing to occur on a lot-by-lot basis in order to release product for clinical use. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

BLA Submission, Review and Approval
-----------------------------------

Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product's chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and proposed labeling, among other information. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies. There can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.

Table of Contents
-----------------

Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA reviews the BLA within 60 days to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA"), the FDA's goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. In both standard and priority reviews, the FDA does not always meet PDUFA goal dates, and the review process can be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification or Company submissions of substantial data during the review. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product's continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions and provide a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites, preclinical studies, and/or the sponsor to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.

After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product and/or its drug substance will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, and where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter prior to inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification, completion of other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, and/or conduct of additional preclinical studies or manufacturing activities. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may determine that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before a biologic may be marketed in the United States. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied and may require additional testing or information.

If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed, which could limit the commercial value of the product. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product, and could include medication guides, healthcare professional and/or patient communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre-and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may impose post-marketing requirements and commitments such as additional manufacturing data or testing; additional preclinical data or evaluation; additional clinical data from Phase 3 studies (e.g. long-term extension data); and may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product's safety and effectiveness after commercialization and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.

Expedited Development and Review Programs
-----------------------------------------

Any marketing application for a biologic submitted to the FDA for approval may be eligible for FDA programs intended to expedite the FDA review and approval process, such as priority review, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy and accelerated approval.

A product is eligible for priority review if it is intended to treat a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. Priority review designation means the FDA's goal under PDUFA is to take action on the marketing application within six months of the 60-day filing date (compared with ten months under standard review).

Table of Contents
-----------------

To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need by providing a therapy where none exists or a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. Fast track designation is intended to facilitate development and expedite review of a product, and also provides opportunities for frequent interactions with the FDA review team. The FDA may also review complete sections of the BLA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the entire application is submitted, if the sponsor and FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the application sections, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. The review clock generally does not begin until the final section of the BLA is submitted.

In addition, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a "breakthrough therapy." A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biologic that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA will take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.

Additionally, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a validated surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than survival or irreversible morbidity and is reasonably likely to predict an effect on survival, irreversible morbidity or another clinical benefit. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA requires the sponsor to perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing confirmatory clinical studies to verify and describe the anticipated effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. Approval may be withdrawn if the confirmatory study does not verify the anticipated clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.

Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review and approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, priority review, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.

Orphan Drug Designation
-----------------------

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or automatically shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process.

If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. Orphan exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application fee. A designated orphan product may not receive orphan exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.

Similarly, in the E.U., the European Commission grants binding decision on orphan designations after a satisfactory scientific assessment provided by the EMA's Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products. To qualify for orphan designation, a medicinal product must meet the following criteria set out in E.U. Orphan Medicinal Products Regulation:

Table of Contents
-----------------

* · it must be intended for the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of a disease that is life-threatening or chronically debilitating;
* · the prevalence of the condition in the E.U. must not be more than 5 in 10,000 or it must be unlikely that marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient returns to justify the investment needed for its development; and
* · no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned can be authorized, or, if such a method exists, the medicine must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.

The orphan designation granted is re-assessed at the time when the marketing authorization is granted in order to confirm whether the statutory criteria continue to be met. If the criteria are no longer met, then the orphan designation is removed.

If the orphan designation is maintained when the marketing authorization is granted, then the orphan medicinal product will receive 10-year orphan market exclusivity in respect of the approved indication. This exclusivity period prevents a similar medicinal product being accepted by the E.U. regulatory authorities for approval. This exclusivity period can be extended to a total period of 12 years under the E.U. Pediatric Regulation in lieu of six-month extension of the supplementary protection certificate, if certain requirements are met. The orphan exclusivity is run in parallel with the basic regulatory data/market protection or exclusivity period of 10 years in the E.U. However, this period can be reduced to six years if at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the criteria for orphan designation are no longer met where it is shown on the basis of available evidence that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.

Following the U.K.' s departure from the E.U. there is no pre-marketing authorization orphan designation in Great Britain. Instead, orphan designation is applied for at the same time as applying for a marketing authorization. While the criteria for gaining orphan designation remain effectively the same in Great Britain as in the European Union, the designation will be based on the prevalence of the relevant condition in Great Britain.

The 10 years market exclusivity from competition from similar products in the approved orphan indication would be retained. If criteria for orphan status are met, this incentive would be awarded following grant of a U.K. marketing authorization. Similarly, in the E.U., orphan medicines which are authorized in Great Britain with the results of studies from a pediatric investigation plan included in the product information are eligible for an additional 2 years of market exclusivity.

Pediatric Information
---------------------

Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act ("PREA"), a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The FDASIA amended the FDCA to require that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan ("PSP"), within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical trials or other clinical development programs.

Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act ("BPCA"), a drug or biologic product can also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study or studies in accordance with an FDA-issued "Written Request" for such a study or studies within a defined timeframe.

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

Table of Contents
-----------------

In the E.U., a sponsor is required to obtain an agreed Pediatric Investigation Plan ("PIP") which describes a program of pediatric studies to generate meaningful data to inform the use of the product in the pediatric population. The data derived from the PIP must be submitted with the marketing authorization application unless a waiver or a deferral is granted. Otherwise, the application will not be accepted by the EMA for review. If the pediatric data required by the PIP are submitted, irrespective of whether the data have led to approval of a pediatric indication, the orphan exclusivity period is extended to a total period of 12 years. For a product which is not an orphan medicinal product, the supplementary protection certificate can be extended to a further six months under the E.U. pediatric rules. For a medicinal product which is no longer protected by a subsisting patent, a pediatric use marketing authorization can be sought and upon approval, a period of 10 years regulatory data exclusivity or protection is granted.

Post-Approval Requirements
--------------------------

Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance, record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved BLA. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.

The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

* · restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, mandated modification of promotional materials or issuance of corrective information, issuance by FDA or other regulatory authorities of safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product, or complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
* · fines, warnings or untitled letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
* · refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
* · product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; or
* · injunctions, consent decrees or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses and misbranding. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties, including monetary penalties. Physicians may prescribe, in their independent medical judgment, legally available products for uses that are not described in the product's labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer's communications on the subject of off-label use of their products, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including investigation by federal and state authorities. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication (or thirty days in advance of their first use if approved via the accelerated approval pathway). Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.

Biosimilars and Reference Product Exclusivity
---------------------------------------------

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ("ACA") signed into law in 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 ("BPCIA"), which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. To date, a number of biosimilars have been licensed under the BPCIA, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe, but no interchangeable biologic has been approved in the United States. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining its approach to the review and approval of biosimilars.

Biosimilarity, which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical study or studies. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products that are administered multiple times to an individual, the biologic and the reference biologic may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.

Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing that applicant's own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of its product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed "interchangeable" by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law.

The BPCIA is complex and continues to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. In addition, government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and impact of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.

In the E.U., a biosimilar product is approved under a different regulatory pathway, recognizing that a biosimilar product does not meet the conditions set out in the definition of a generic medicinal product owing to in particular differences relating to raw materials or differences in manufacturing processes of the biological medicinal product and the reference biological medicinal. In view of these differences, a biosimilar is required to provide the results of appropriate comparative clinical and nonclinical studies with the reference biological medicinal product to demonstrate that the biosimilar is both highly similar to the reference product (notwithstanding natural variability inherent to all biological medicines) and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biosimilar and the reference medicine in terms of safety, quality, and efficacy. However, the biosimilar manufacturer is not required to replicate the testing results or trial data contained in the dossier of the reference biological medicinal product.

Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
------------------------------------------------------

In the United States, our current and future operations are subject to regulation and oversight by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS") or other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") (such as the Office of Inspector General, Office for Civil Rights and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments and regulatory authorities. For example, our clinical research, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable. Our business operations and current and future arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors and customers may be subject to healthcare laws, regulations and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, price reporting and transparency, and physician sunshine laws. Some of our pre-commercial activities are subject to certain of these laws.

Table of Contents
-----------------

The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between therapeutic product manufacturers on one hand and, for example, prescribers, purchasers, third party payors, pharmacies, and pharmacy benefit managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from the reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute. The exceptions and safe harbors are interpreted narrowly by enforcement authorities, and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending any product payable by the federal health care programs may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, where an arrangement does not clearly meet the terms of an applicable exception or safe harbor, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on prudential factors that authorities, including the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, utilize to determine whether a particular arrangement poses a risk of fraud and abuse to the federal health care programs (e.g., increasing costs to government payors). Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor, and we cannot rule out the possibility that enforcement authorities, including the Office of Inspector General, could scrutinize our practices in the future.

Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the ACA to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute can result in significant civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, and exclusion from federal healthcare programs. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act ("FCA") (discussed below).

The federal false claims laws, including the FCA, which can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or "qui tam" actions, and the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or knowingly making a false statement to improperly avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim includes "any request or demand" for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been, and continue to be, prosecuted under these laws, among other things, for various conduct. For example, enforcement has pursued manufacturers allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product, and also for causing false claims to be submitted because of the marketing of the product for unapproved, off-label, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses.

HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes that were added by HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.

We may be subject to data privacy, security, and breach notification regulations administered by the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. If we were to enter into a "business associate" relationship with a "covered entity" ("covered entities" being group health plans, certain healthcare providers, and "healthcare clearinghouses"), we would be subject to the HHS regulations related to data privacy, security and security breach notification under the Administrative Simplification provisions of HIPAA (Title II, Subtitle F of HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ("HITECH"). Those regulations authorize the imposition of civil and criminal penalties, damages, injunctions, attorneys' fees and costs. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not pre-empted by HIPAA, and may have a more prohibitive effect than HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act (the "Sunshine Act") within the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report such information regarding its payments and other transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives during the previous year. Failure to report accurately could result in penalties.

Many states have similar statutes or regulations to the above federal laws that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor (i.e., are not exclusive to government payors). We may also be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, and/or state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, drug pricing or marketing expenditures. These laws may differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, further complicating compliance efforts.

We are subject to the Federal Drug Supply Chain Security Act ("DSCSA") enacted by the U.S. government, which requires development of an electronic pedigree to track and trace each prescription biologic at the salable unit level through the distribution system, which will be effective incrementally over a 10-year period from its enactment on November 27, 2013. In addition, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution. Compliance with DSCSA and current and future U.S. federal or state electronic pedigree requirements could require significant capital expenditures, increase our operating costs and impose significant administrative burdens. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. Additionally, to the extent that we have business operations in foreign countries or sell any of our products in foreign countries and jurisdictions, including Canada or the E.U., we may be subject to additional regulation.

Ensuring business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations is a costly endeavor. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other current or future governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, significant civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private "qui tam" actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of noncompliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and results of operations.

Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
-----------------------------------

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which Immunovant may obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and in foreign markets, sales of any products for which Immunovant receives regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. Adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, and commercial payors are critical to new product acceptance.

Table of Contents
-----------------

Our ability to commercialize any products successfully also will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from third-party payors, which decide which therapeutics they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor's determination that use of a therapeutic is:

* · a covered benefit under its health plan;
* · safe, effective and medically necessary;
* · appropriate for the specific patient;
* · cost-effective; and
* · neither experimental nor investigational.

We cannot be sure that coverage or reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if coverage and reimbursement are available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage may also be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product for which we obtain regulatory approval.

We may develop products that, once approved, may be administered by a physician, and these products also may have difficulty obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement levels based on payor cost sensitivities and the potential application of formulary management controls (e.g., step edits through alternative therapies). Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization.

Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to closely evaluating their safety and efficacy. Obtaining reimbursement for our products may be particularly difficult given the potential cost sensitivities often associated with branded drugs and drugs administered under the supervision of a physician. It is not clear that third party payors will accept the pharmacoeconomic benefits of products that we commercialize, and we also may need to undertake detailed studies of any therapies that we commercialize in order to demonstrate their pharmacoeconomic benefits, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective for certain patients, including depending on the nature of the FDA approvals that we may receive. There is no assurance of coverage or adequate reimbursement for our products under either government programs or from commercial payors. Further, one payor's determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. If reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidate that we successfully develop.

Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the E.U., governments influence the price of biopharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to establish their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from lowpriced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.

The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative changes in the United States has increased, and we expect will continue to increase, the pressure on healthcare pricing. The downward pressure on the rise in healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, medical devices and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become a close focus of government and state regulators. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement rates are attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future, which could have a downward pressure on our commercialization efforts.

Healthcare Reform
-----------------

In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the ability to profitably sell product candidates for which marketing approval is obtained. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.

For example, the ACA has substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers. Among the ACA provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following:

* · an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs;
* · an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23% and 13% of the Average Manufacturer Price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively, and capped the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price;
* · a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable branded drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers' outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
* · extension of manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
* · expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability;
* · expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the 340B Drug Discount Program;
* · a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research;
* · expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the FCA and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
* · a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected;
* · requirements to report certain financial arrangements with certain healthcare providers and teaching hospitals;
* · a requirement to annually report certain information regarding drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;
* · establishment of a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending; and
* · a licensure framework for follow on biologic products.

Since its enactment, there have been legal and political challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. By way of example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("TCJA") included a provision that repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the "individual mandate." In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated "Cadillac" tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the TCJA, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that the individual mandate was unconstitutional but remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the case, although it is unknown when a decision will be made or how the Supreme Court will rule. Although the U.S. Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the ACA, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace, which began on February 15, 2021 and will remain open through August 15, 2021. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA. On February 10, 2021, the Biden administration withdrew the federal government's support for overturning the ACA. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug's average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. It is unclear how the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation, and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA. In addition, there may be other efforts to challenge, repeal or replace the ACA. The ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation on the U.S. healthcare industry is also unclear.

Further legislation or regulation could be passed that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. These Medicare sequester reductions will be suspended from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.

Additionally, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to specialty drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries, presidential executive orders and proposed and enacted federal legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the former Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the former Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempted to implement several of the administration's proposals. As a result, the FDA released a final rule on September 24, 2020, effective November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed by the Biden administration until January 1, 2023. Further, on November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump's Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries. The Most Favored Nation regulations mandate participation by identified Medicare Part B providers and will apply in all U.S. states and territories for a seven-year period beginning January 1, 2021, and ending December 31, 2027. On December 28, 2020, the United States District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. However, it is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives.

-----------------

Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to COVID-19.

We expect that these and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
---------------------------------

The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA") prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.

Additional Regulation
---------------------

In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding safe working conditions, environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.

Other Regulations
-----------------

We are also subject to numerous federal, state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances. We may incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future.

Human Capital Management
------------------------

Employees
---------

As of May 31, 2021, we had 68 full-time permanent employees, primarily in the United States. Of these employees, approximately 72% have advanced degrees including but not limited to Ph.D., M.D., M.B.A., and approximately 66% were engaged in research and development activities. More than half of our workforce, as well as our executive leadership, is comprised of women. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements, and we have not had any work stoppages. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.

As the clinical development of our product candidates progresses, we also expect to experience significant growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of clinical development, quality, regulatory affairs and, if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, sales, marketing and distribution. In addition, we also expect to hire additional personnel in order to sustain operations as a public company.

Table of Contents
-----------------

Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purpose of our equity incentive plan is to attract, retain, and motivate our employees, non-employee directors, and consultants through the granting of stockbased compensation and performance cash awards. Our cash bonus awards are based on Company and departmental progress toward key annual goals and employee performance.

Response to COVID-19
--------------------

We are focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees. With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic and in the best interest of the safety of our employees, we transitioned to a remote work model in March 2020 and our workforce continues to work remotely. We are supporting our employees through this transition by providing the necessary information technology and collaboration tools to ensure business continuity. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we hired a considerable number of employees and effectively onboarded talent through the remote work environment. We gained significant experience in hiring, onboarding and operating under a remote work environment. This valuable experience has enabled us to enhance our recruitment strategies by targeting high-potential talent based primarily on technical capabilities, skills, experience level and cultural alignment, regardless of geographic location. We believe our access to a broader talent pool will continue to contribute to our effectiveness in working in a remote environment.

Corporate Information
---------------------

Prior to December 18, 2019, we were known as Health Sciences Acquisitions Corporation ("HSAC"). HSAC was incorporated in Delaware on December 6, 2018 and formed as a blank check company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. On December 18, 2019, HSAC completed the Business Combination, pursuant to which HSAC acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of ISL, a Bermuda exempted limited company. Subsequent to the acquisition, ISL became a wholly owned subsidiary of HSAC and we were renamed "Immunovant, Inc."

We maintain our headquarters at 320 West 37th Street, New York, New York 10018 and also conduct business operations at 1000 Park Forty Plaza, Suite 210, Durham, North Carolina 27713. ISL's registered office is located at Clarendon House, 2 Church Street, Hamilton HM11, Bermuda and ISL's principal office is located at Suite 1, 3rd Floor, 11-12 St. James's Square, London, SW1Y 4LB, United Kingdom. ISG maintains its headquarters at Viaduktstrasse 8, 4051 Basel, Switzerland.

Item 1A. Risk Factors
---------------------

Our business involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. We cannot assure you that any of the events discussed in the risk factors below will not occur. These risks could have a material and adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and, if so, our future prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. If any of such events were to happen, the trading price of shares of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.

Risks Related to Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Our success relies upon a singular product candidate, IMVT-1401, for which all clinical development by the Company has paused due to its presumed causation of elevated lipid levels in patients dosed with the drug. Unless we can determine a dosing regimen, target patient population, safety monitoring and risk management for IMVT-1401 in autoimmune diseases for which the risks of lipid elevations and albumin reductions can be mitigated, we will not be able to show adequate benefit to risk ratio and will not be able to continue clinical development or seek or obtain marketing authorization in any jurisdiction.

In February 2021, we voluntarily paused dosing in our clinical trials for IMVT-1401 due to elevated total cholesterol and LDL levels observed in some trial subjects treated with IMVT-1401. In our ASCEND GO-2 trial, lipid parameters were assessed at baseline, at week 12, and at week 20 following eight weeks off drug. Based on preliminary, unblinded data, median LDL cholesterol at week 12 was increased by approximately 12 mg/dL in the 255 mg dose group (corresponding to an increase from baseline of approximately 15%), by approximately 33 mg/dL in the 340 mg dose group (corresponding to an increase from baseline of approximately 37%), by approximately 62 mg/dL in the 680 mg dose group (corresponding to an increase from baseline of approximately 52%) and did not increase in the control group. The data analysis indicates a dose-dependent increase in lipids. Average HDL and triglyceride levels also increased but to a much lesser degree. We also observed correlated decreases in albumin levels and the rate and extent of albumin reductions were dose-dependent. Subjects receiving the 255 mg weekly dose("QW") experienced the smallest reductions in albumin through week 12, with a median reduction of about 16% from baseline, while subjects receiving the 340 mg or 680 mg QW dose experienced median reductions of albumin of 26% or 40%, respectively. At week 20, both lipids and albumin returned to baseline.

In our open label ASCEND WAIHA trial, only two subjects completed 12 weeks of dosing prior to the program-wide pause in dosing, with three additional subjects partially completing the dosing period. Pre-specified and post-hoc lipid test results from these five subjects were analyzed along with post-hoc lipid test results performed on frozen samples from ASCEND MG subjects (where available) and post-hoc lipid test results from our Phase 1 Injection Site study. LDL elevations observed in the ASCEND WAIHA and ASCEND MG subject populations and in healthy subjects in the Phase 1 Injection Site Study also appeared to be dose-dependent and were generally consistent in magnitude with the elevations observed in ASCEND GO-2 subjects.

No major adverse cardiovascular events have been reported to date in IMVT-1401 clinical trials.

In order to better characterize the observed lipid findings, we conducted from February 2021 through May 2021 a program-wide data review (including both clinical and nonclinical data) with input from external scientific and medical experts. Further, it is our intent to resume development across multiple indications for IMVT-1401. We are in the process of drafting multiple study protocols and updating our program-wide safety strategy for discussions with regulatory agencies. The elements of our development program will include extensive PK/PD modeling to select dosing regimens for IMVT-1401 which optimize reductions in total IgG levels while minimizing the impact on albumin and LDL levels, particularly for clinical studies containing long-term treatment extensions. These protocols will likely include protocol-directed guidelines for the management of any observed lipid abnormalities. While increases in LDL over an 8 to 12 week treatment duration would not be expected to pose a safety concern for patients, the risk-benefit profile of long-term administration of IMVT-1401 will need to incorporate any unfavorable effects on lipid profiles. Discussions with regulatory agencies, including the FDA, are expected to commence during the second half of the calendar year 2021.

-----------------

It is possible that no sufficient risk mitigation will be able to be agreed with regulatory authorities and that our development of IMVT-1401 will not continue. Even if we are able to continue clinical development of IMVT-1401 with such risk mitigations, any future approval and marketing would suffer from the risks of potential longterm lipid and albumin changes and potential impact of mitigating measures, including, among others, limited indication, monitoring, REMS, and other adverse labeling.

Our product candidate has caused and may cause adverse events (including but not limited to, elevated total cholesterol and LDL levels and reductions in albumin) or have other properties that could delay or prevent its regulatory approval, cause us to further suspend or discontinue clinical trials, abandon further development or limit the scope of any approved label or market acceptance.

Adverse events associated with our product candidate in our clinical trials could cause us, other reviewing entities, clinical trial sites or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in the denial of regulatory approval. The most commonly reported AE in our Phase 1 clinical trial was mild erythema and swelling at the injection site, which typically resolved within hours; as previously disclosed, lipid levels were not measured contemporaneously during these Phase 1, ASCEND MG and ASCEND GO-1 clinical trials of IMVT-1401. If an unacceptable frequency or severity of AEs or new safety signals are reported in our clinical trials for our product candidate, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for such product candidate may be negatively impacted. Treatment-related side effects arising from, or those potentially arising from, our product candidate or those from other companies targeting similar autoimmune indications could affect the design of clinical studies, target patient population, enrollment and conduct of the studies, patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial, eventual labeling and risk management, or result in potential product liability claims. In addition, these side effects may not be appropriately recognized or managed by the treating medical staff.

For example, in February 2021, we voluntarily paused dosing in our clinical trials for IMVT-1401 due to elevated total cholesterol and LDL levels observed in some trial subjects treated with IMVT-1401. Based on our program-wide data review, in our ASCEND GO-2 trial, data analysis indicates a dose-dependent increase in lipids and our ASCEND WAIHA initial preliminary data indicated a similar trend in lipid parameters as compared to those in the ASCEND GO-2 trial. We also observed a decrease in albumin levels and the rate and extent of albumin reductions were dose-dependent. We plan to progress discussions with regulatory authorities to align on the next steps in the continued development of IMVT-1401. These occurrences have harmed, and any reoccurrences may continue to harm, our business, financial condition and prospects.

If our product candidate is approved and then causes serious or unexpected side effects, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:

* · regulatory authorities may withdraw, suspend or limit their approval of the product or require a REMS (or equivalent outside the United States) to impose restrictions on its distribution or other risk management measures;
* · we may be required to recall a product;

* · our reputation may suffer.

Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product candidate and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidate, if approved.

Clinical trials are very expensive, time-consuming, difficult to design and implement, and involve uncertain outcomes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our product candidate is still in clinical development and will require extensive clinical testing before we are prepared to submit a BLA or other similar application for regulatory marketing approval. We cannot provide you any assurance that we will submit a BLA for regulatory approval for our product candidate within our projected timeframes or whether any such application will be approved by the relevant regulatory authorities. Clinical trials are very expensive and difficult to design and implement, in part because they are subject to rigorous regulatory requirements. For instance, the FDA or other regulatory authorities may not agree with our proposed analysis plans or trial design for any clinical trials for IMVT-1401; during any such review, may identify unexpected efficacy or safety concerns, which may delay the approval of a BLA or similar application. The FDA may also find that the benefits of IMVT-1401 in any of our target indications do not outweigh its risks, including the risks associated with elevated lipid levels and lower albumin levels, in a manner sufficient to grant regulatory approval. The clinical trial process is also time-consuming and costly and relies on the collaboration with many CROs and clinical trial sites.

Failures can occur at any stage of clinical trials, and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials. In addition, results from clinical trials may require further evaluation delaying the next stage of clinical development or submission of a BLA. Further, product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through nonclinical studies and initial clinical trials, and such product candidates may exhibit negative safety signals in later stage clinical trials that they did not exhibit in nonclinical or earlier-stage clinical trials. A number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in, or the discontinuation of, advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Likewise, the results of early nonclinical studies and clinical trials of IMVT-1401, some of which were not conducted by us, may not be predictive of the results of our planned development programs, and there can be no assurance that the results of studies conducted by collaborators or other third parties will be viewed favorably or are indicative of our own future trial results.

In February 2021, we voluntarily paused dosing in our clinical trials for IMVT-1401 due to elevated total cholesterol and LDL levels observed in some trial subjects treated with IMVT-1401. If we fail to successfully complete our clinical trials of IMVT-1401 and demonstrate the efficacy and safety necessary to obtain regulatory approval to market IMVT-1401 our business, financial condition and business prospects would be harmed.

The commencement and completion of clinical trials may be delayed by several factors, including:

* · failure to obtain regulatory authorization to commence a trial or reaching consensus with regulatory authorities regarding the design or implementation of our studies;
* · unforeseen safety issues, or subjects experiencing severe or unexpected adverse events, or AEs;
* · continuous safety issues, despite our program wide safety strategy to characterize the safety profile of IMVT-1401 in response to the previously reported change in albumin and lipids;
* · occurrence of AEs in trials of the same class of agents conducted by other sponsors;
* · lack of effectiveness during clinical trials;
* · resolving any dosing issues or limitations, including those raised by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;
* · inability to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;
* · slower than expected rates of patient recruitment or failure to recruit suitable patients to participate in a trial;
* · failure to add a sufficient number of clinical trial sites;

Table of Contents
-----------------

* · unanticipated impact from changes in or modifications to protocols or clinical trial design, including those that may be required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities;
* · inability or unwillingness of clinical investigators or study participants to follow our clinical and other applicable protocols or applicable regulatory requirements;
* · an institutional review board or IRB, refusing to approve, suspending, or terminating the trial at an investigational site, precluding enrollment of additional subjects, or withdrawing their approval of the trial;
* · premature discontinuation of study participants from clinical trials or missing data at a level that impacts study integrity;
* · failure to manufacture or release sufficient quantities of our product candidate or placebo or failure to obtain sufficient quantities of active comparator medications for our clinical trials, if applicable, that in each case meet our and global quality standards, for use in clinical trials;
* · inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment; or
* · inappropriate unblinding of trial results.

In addition, disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic increase the likelihood that we encounter such difficulties or delays in initiating, enrolling, conducting or completing our planned and ongoing clinical trials. Further, we, the FDA or another regulatory authority may suspend our clinical trials in an entire country at any time, or an IRB may suspend its clinical trial sites within any country, if it appears that we or our collaborators are failing to conduct a trial in accordance with regulatory requirements, including GCP, that we are exposing participants to unacceptable health risks, or if the FDA or other regulatory authority, as the case may be, finds deficiencies in our IND or equivalent applications for other countries or the manner in which the clinical trials are conducted. Therefore, we cannot predict with any certainty the schedule for commencement and completion of future clinical trials. If we experience delays in the commencement or completion of our clinical trials, or if we terminate a clinical trial prior to completion, the commercial prospects of our product candidate could be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenue from our product candidate, if approved, may be delayed. In addition, any delays in our clinical trials could increase our costs, cause a decline in our share price, slow down the approval process, and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, many of the factors that cause or lead to a termination or suspension of, or delay in, the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidate. We may make formulation or manufacturing changes to our product candidate, in which case we may need to conduct additional nonclinical or clinical studies to bridge our modified product candidate to earlier versions. Any delays to our clinical trials that occur as a result could shorten any period during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidate and our competitors may be able to bring products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of our product candidate could be significantly reduced.

Moreover, principal investigators for our clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and receive compensation in connection with such services. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to report some of these relationships to the FDA or other regulatory authorities. The FDA or other regulatory authorities may conclude that a financial relationship between us and a principal investigator has created a conflict of interest or otherwise affected the integrity of the study. The FDA or other regulatory authority may therefore question the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site and the utility of the clinical trial itself may be jeopardized. This could result in a delay in approval, or rejection, of our marketing applications by the FDA or other regulatory authority, as the case may be, and may ultimately lead to the denial of marketing approval of our product candidate.

-----------------

In addition, we had no involvement with or control over the nonclinical or clinical development of IMVT-1401 prior to its in-license from HanAll. We are dependent on our licensing partner having conducted such research and development in accordance with the applicable protocols and legal, regulatory and scientific standards, having accurately reported the results of all nonclinical studies and clinical trials and other research they conducted prior to our acquisition of the rights to our product candidate, having correctly collected and interpreted the data from these studies, trials and other research, and having supplied us with complete information, data sets and reports required to adequately demonstrate the results reported through the date of our acquisition of this asset. Problems related to our predecessor could result in increased costs and delays in the development of our product candidate, which could adversely affect our ability to generate any future revenue from sales of our product candidate, if approved.

Enrollment and retention of patients in clinical trials is an expensive and time-consuming process and could be made more difficult or rendered impossible by multiple factors outside our control.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We may encounter delays or difficulties in enrolling, or be unable to enroll, a sufficient number of patients to complete any of our clinical trials on our current timelines, or at all, and even once enrolled we may be unable to retain a sufficient number of patients to complete any of our trials. Enrollment in our clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate, or be stopped, leading to delays in our development timelines. For example, we may face difficulty enrolling or maintaining a sufficient number of patients in our clinical trials for MG, TED and WAIHA due to the existing alternative treatments available for the treatment of MG, TED and WAIHA, as patients may decline to enroll or decide to withdraw from our clinical trials due to the risk of receiving placebo.

Patient enrollment and retention in clinical trials depends on many factors, including the size of the patient population, the nature of the trial protocol, our ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience, delays in enrollment due to travel or quarantine policies, or other factors, related to COVID-19, the existing body of safety and efficacy data with respect to the study drug, the number and nature of competing treatments and ongoing clinical trials of competing drugs for the same indication, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial and the proportion of patients screened that meets those criteria, our ability to obtain and maintain patient consents, our ability to successfully complete prerequisite studies before enrolling certain patient populations. Our product candidate is focused in part on addressing rare autoimmune indications, and we have focused our initial development efforts on the treatment of MG, TED and WAIHA with limited patient pools from which to draw in order to complete our clinical trials in a timely and cost-effective manner. We are also pursuing a series of other indications.

Furthermore, any negative results or new safety signals we may report in clinical trials of our product candidate may make it difficult or impossible to recruit and retain patients in other clinical trials we are conducting or to resume enrolling patients once a paused clinical trial has been resumed. For example, in February 2021, we reported that we voluntarily paused dosing in our clinical trials for IMVT-1401 due to elevated total cholesterol and LDL levels observed in patients treated with IMVT1401. While we completed an in-depth review of the preliminary data and updating our comprehensive strategy to address benefit/risk, it may be more difficult to recruit and retain patients for clinical trials in the future. Similarly, negative results reported by our competitors about their drug candidates may negatively affect patient recruitment in our clinical trials. Also, marketing authorization of competitors in this same class of drugs may impair our ability to enroll patients into our clinical trials, delaying or potentially preventing us from completing recruitment of one or more of our trials.

Delays or failures in planned patient enrollment or retention may result in increased costs, program delays or both, which could have a harmful effect on our ability to develop our product candidate, or could render further development impossible. In addition, we expect to rely on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure proper and timely conduct of our future clinical trials, and, while we intend to enter into agreements governing their services, we will be limited in our ability to compel their actual performance.

Table of Contents
-----------------

The results of our nonclinical and clinical trials may not support our proposed claims for our product candidate, or regulatory approval on a timely basis or at all, and the results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Success in nonclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the results of later clinical trials will replicate the results of prior nonclinical testing and clinical trials. In particular, we cannot assure you that the reductions in IgG antibodies that we have observed to date in our Phase 1 clinical trial of IMVT-1401 will be observed in any future clinical trials. Likewise, promising results in interim analyses or other preliminary analyses do not ensure that the clinical trial as a whole will be successful. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry, including biotechnology companies, have suffered significant setbacks in, or the discontinuation of, clinical trials, even after promising results in earlier nonclinical studies or clinical trials. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, nonclinical findings observed while clinical trials were underway and safety or efficacy observations in clinical trials. For example, in February 2021, we voluntarily paused dosing in our clinical trials for IMVT-1401 due to elevated total cholesterol and LDL levels observed in some trial subjects treated with IMVT-1401.

We plan to progress discussions with regulatory authorities, with the intent to continue development of IMVT-1401. For example, while the ASCEND GO-2 trial was terminated and the efficacy results, based on approximately half the anticipated number of subjects who had reached the week 13 primary efficacy analysis at the time of the termination of the trial, were inconclusive, further discussions with external experts are ongoing to determine whether a specific population can be identified to optimize the clinical performance of IMVT-1401. Based on these analyses, we are likely to design another Phase 2 trial in TED or another thyroid-related disease as our next study in this therapeutic area and initiate discussions with regulatory authorities before the end of the calendar year 2021. Our failure to successfully complete our clinical trials of IMVT-1401 and to demonstrate the efficacy and safety necessary to obtain regulatory approval to market IMVT-1401 would significantly harm our business.

Further, product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through nonclinical and initial clinical trials. A future failure of a clinical trial to meet its pre-specified endpoints would likely cause us to abandon our indication. Any delay in, or termination of, our clinical trials will delay the submission of a BLA to the FDA or other similar applications with other relevant foreign regulatory authorities and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidate, if approved, and generate product revenue. Even if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support our expectations for differentiation or the effectiveness or safety of our product candidate. The FDA has substantial discretion in the review and approval process and may disagree that our data support the differentiated claims we propose. In addition, only a small percentage of biologics under development result in the submission of a BLA to the FDA and even fewer are approved for commercialization.

Interim, "top-line" or preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.

From time to time, we may publicly disclose preliminary or "top-line" data from our clinical trials, which is based on a preliminary analysis of then-available top-line data, and the results and related findings and conclusions are subject to change following a full analysis of all data related to the particular trial. We also make assumptions, estimations, calculations and conclusions as part of our analyses of data, and we may not have received or had the opportunity to fully and carefully evaluate all data. As a result, the top-line results that we report may differ from future results of the same trials, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results, once additional data have been received and fully evaluated. Top-line data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, top-line data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. We may also disclose interim data from our clinical trials. Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Adverse differences between preliminary or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects. Further, disclosure of preliminary or interim data by us or by our competitors could result in volatility in the price of shares of our common stock.

Further, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular product candidate or product and our business in general. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and you or others may not agree with what we determine is the material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure, and any information we determine not to disclose may ultimately be deemed significant with respect to future decisions, conclusions, views, activities or otherwise regarding a particular drug, product candidate or our business. If the top-line data that we report differ from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for and commercialize IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate, our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition may be harmed.

We may not be able to successfully develop and commercialize our product candidate IMVT-1401 on a timely basis or at all.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMVT-1401 is a novel therapeutic antibody and its potential therapeutic benefit is unproven. While several FcRn inhibitor candidates are under development by other companies, there is currently no approved therapy inhibiting FcRn for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, and, as a result, the regulatory pathway for IMVT-1401 may present novel issues that could cause delays in development or approval. While results from early clinical trials of IMVT-1401 have shown meaningful reductions in IgG antibody levels in healthy volunteers, IMVT-1401 may not demonstrate in patients any or all of the pharmacological benefits we believe it may possess. We have not yet succeeded and may never succeed in demonstrating efficacy and safety for IMVT-1401 in pivotal clinical trials or in obtaining marketing approval thereafter. For example, although we and our licensing partner have evaluated IMVT-1401 nonclinical studies and in early-stage clinical trials, we have not yet advanced IMVT-1401 into a large-scale, pivotal clinical trial for any indication. Positive results from our early-stage clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of the results of our planned clinical trials of IMVT-1401. For example, in February 2021, we voluntarily paused dosing in our clinical trials for IMVT-1401 due to elevated total cholesterol and LDL levels observed in some trial subjects treated with IMVT-1401. In order to better characterize the observed lipid findings, we conducted from February 2021 through May 2021 a program-wide data review (including both clinical and nonclinical data) with input from external scientific and medical experts. We also plan to progress discussions with regulatory authorities to align on the next steps in the continued development of IMVT-1401, including ASCEND MG and ASCEND WAIHA trials. If expectations from our Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials cannot be replicated, we may be unable to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize IMVT-1401 for the treatment of MG, WAIHA and TED or any other autoimmune indication. As a result, our focus on exploring FcRn inhibition may fail to result in the identification of viable additional indications for IMVT-1401. If we are unsuccessful in our development efforts, we may not be able to advance the development of or commercialize IMVT-1401, raise capital, expand our business or continue our operations.

If we are not able to obtain required regulatory approvals, we will not be able to commercialize IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate, and our ability to generate product revenue will be impaired.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMVT-1401 and any future product candidate that we may develop, as well as the activities associated with their development and commercialization, including their design, research, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling, packaging, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the United States and by similar regulatory authorities outside the United States. Failure to obtain marketing approval for, and thus commercialize any product candidate, could negatively impact our ability to generate any revenue from product sales.

We have not received approval from regulatory authorities to market any product candidate in any jurisdiction, and it is possible that our product candidate will never obtain the appropriate regulatory approvals necessary for us to commence product sales. Neither we nor any collaborator is permitted to market our product candidate in the United States or any other jurisdiction until we receive regulatory approval of a BLA from the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside of the United States.

Table of Contents
-----------------

The time required to obtain approval of a BLA by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities outside of the United States is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authority. Prior to submitting a BLA to the FDA or any comparable application to any other foreign regulatory authorities for approval of any product candidate, we will need to complete pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate favorable results with respect to safety, tolerability and efficacy. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate's clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions.

Securing marketing approvals requires the submission of extensive manufacturing, nonclinical and clinical data and supporting information to regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the safety and efficacy of our product candidate for the specified indications. We expect to rely on third-party CROs, consultants and our collaborators to assist us in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals. Securing marketing approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to, and inspection of manufacturing facilities by, the regulatory authorities. Errors in the submission of applications for marketing approval or issues, including those related to gathering the appropriate data and the inspection process, may ultimately delay or affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval, commercialize our product candidate and generate product revenue.

IMVT-1401 is an antibody protein that could cause an immune response in patients, resulting in the creation of harmful or neutralizing antibodies against these therapeutic proteins, preventing or limiting regulatory approval or our ability to commercialize IMVT-1401.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the safety, efficacy, manufacturing, and regulatory hurdles faced by our product candidate, IMVT-1401, the administration of proteins such as monoclonal antibodies, even those that are fully human in nature including our product candidate, can cause an immune response, resulting in the creation of antibodies against the therapeutic protein. These anti-drug antibodies can have no effect or can neutralize the effectiveness of the protein, or require that higher doses be used to obtain a therapeutic effect. Whether anti-drug antibodies will be created and how they react can often not be predicted from nonclinical or even clinical studies, and their detection or appearance is often delayed. As a result, neutralizing antibodies may be detected at a later date or upon longer exposure of patients with our product candidates, such as following more chronic administration in longer lasting clinical trials. In some cases, detection of such neutralizing antibodies can even occur after pivotal clinical trials have been completed. Therefore, there can be no assurance that neutralizing antibodies will not be detected in future clinical trials or at a later date upon longer exposure (including after commercialization). If anti-drug antibodies reduce or neutralize the effectiveness of our product candidate, the continued clinical development or receipt of marketing approval for our product candidate could be delayed or prevented and, even if our product candidate is approved, its commercial success could be limited, any of which would impair our ability to generate revenue and continue operations.

We have licensed the rights to IMVT-1401 in limited territories. Any adverse developments that occur during any clinical trials or manufacturing conducted by third parties, including HanAll, in other jurisdictions may affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval or commercialize IMVT-1401.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have licensed the right to develop, manufacture and commercialize IMVT-1401 in the Licensed Territory. HanAll or any of its sublicensees or collaborators, over which we have no control, has the right to develop, manufacture and commercialize IMVT-1401 in geographies outside of our Licensed Territory. If an impact to the characterization of the safety profile occurs in studies conducted by HanAll or third parties in other jurisdictions outside of our Licensed Territory, the FDA may delay, limit or deny approval of IMVT-1401 or require us to conduct additional clinical trials as a condition to marketing approval, which would increase our costs and time to market. If we receive FDA approval for IMVT-1401 and a new and/or serious safety issue is identified in connection with clinical trials of IMVT-1401 conducted by third parties in other jurisdictions outside of our Licensed Territory, the FDA may withdraw their approval of the product or otherwise restrict our ability to market and sell IMVT-1401 or may require additional testing or evaluation. In addition, treating physicians may be less willing to administer our product candidate due to concerns over such AEs, which would limit our ability to commercialize IMVT-1401. In addition, issues may arise in connection with the manufacturing process for IMVT-1401 utilized by HanAll or any of its sublicensees or collaborators, which could affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval for, or commercialize, IMVT-1401.

We face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies targeting autoimmune disease indications, and our operating results will suffer if we fail to compete effectively.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The markets for autoimmune disease therapies are competitive and are characterized by significant technological development and new product introduction. For example, there are several large and small pharmaceutical companies focused on delivering therapeutics for our targeted autoimmune disease indications, including MG, WAIHA and TED. We anticipate that, if we obtain regulatory approval of our product candidate, we will face significant competition from other approved therapies or drugs that become available in the future for the treatment of our target indications. If approved, our product candidate may also compete with unregulated, unapproved and off-label treatments. Even if a biosimilar product is less effective than our product candidate, a less effective biosimilar may be more quickly adopted by physicians and patients than our competing product candidate based upon cost or convenience. Our product candidate, if approved, is expected to present a novel therapeutic approach for MG, TED and WAIHA and other targeted indications and will have to compete with existing therapies, some of which are widely known and accepted by physicians and patients. To compete successfully in this market, we will have to demonstrate that the relative cost, safety and efficacy of our product, if approved, provide an attractive alternative to existing and other new therapies to gain a share of some patients' discretionary budgets and to gain physicians' attention within their clinical practices. Some of the companies that may offer competing products also have a broad range of other product offerings, large direct sales forces and long-term customer relationships with our target physicians, which could inhibit our market penetration efforts. Such competition could lead to reduced market share for our product candidate and contribute to downward pressure on the pricing of our product candidate, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.

We expect to face intense competition from other biopharmaceutical companies who are developing agents for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, including multiple agents which are in the same class as IMVT-1401. We are aware of several FcRn inhibitors that are in clinical development. These include, efgartigimod (argenx SE), nipocalimab (Johnson & Johnson), rozanolixizumab (UCB) and ALXN1830 (Alexion Pharmaceuticals).

We also expect to face competition from agents with different mechanisms of action. In January 2020, the FDA approved Horizon Therapeutics' Tepezza (teprotumumab), an anti-IGF-1R antibody, for the treatment of TED. The most commonly prescribed first-line agents for the treatment of MG are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as pyridostigmine, which are marketed by several manufacturers of generic medicines. Intravenous immunoglobulin, or IVIg, is also routinely used for patients with MG. Eculizumab (marketed by Alexion Pharmaceuticals), an antibody inhibitor of the C5 protein, was recently approved in 2017 for the treatment of generalized MG in patients who are positive for anti-AChR antibodies. The first line of treatment for patients with TED or WAIHA is generally immunosuppressive therapy, including high doses of corticosteroids. Other broad immunosuppressive drugs, such as cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine, are used when patients do not respond adequately to corticosteroids. Rituximab (Roche), a monoclonal antibody that binds to an antigen specific to antibody-producing B cells, may also be used as a treatment for TED, WAIHA and other IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases. Johnson & Johnson is developing its hypersialylated IVIg, M254, in a variety of autoimmune indications. Other product candidates in development for the treatment of MG include zilucoplan (UCB), a peptide inhibitor of C5, inebilizumab (Horizon Therapeutics), a CD19-targeted humanized monoclonal antibody, and Ravulizumab-cwvz (Alexion), an antibody inhibitor of the C5 protein, all of which are currently in Phase 3 trials.

Fostamatinib (Rigel Pharmaceuticals), a syk inhibitor, is currently in Phase 3 development for the treatment of WAIHA. A Phase 2 investigator-initiated study of ibrutinib (AbbVie), a BTK inhibitor, in steroid-refractory WAIHA is ongoing. Annexon Biosciences plans to initiate a Phase 2 trial for WAIHA in 2021 for ANX005, an antibody inhibitor of the C1q protein.

Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, as well as in obtaining regulatory approvals of those product candidates in the United States and in foreign countries. Many of our current and potential future competitors also have significantly more experience commercializing drugs that have been approved for marketing. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Competition may reduce the number and types of patients available to us to participate in clinical trials, because some patients who might have opted to enroll in our trials may instead opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors.

Table of Contents
-----------------

Due to varying regulatory requirements in certain foreign countries, there are many more products and procedures available for use to treat autoimmune diseases in some international markets than are approved for use in the United States. In certain international markets, there are also fewer limitations on the claims that our competitors can make about the effectiveness of their products and the manner in which they can market their products. As a result, we expect to face more competition in these markets than in the United States.

Our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on our ability to:

* · develop and commercialize therapies in our target indications that are superior to other products in the market;
* · demonstrate through our clinical trials that IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate is differentiated from existing and future therapies;
* · attract qualified scientific, product development, manufacturing and commercial personnel;
* · obtain patent or other proprietary protection for IMVT-1401 and any future product candidates;
* · obtain required regulatory approvals, including approvals to market IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate we develop, in ways that are differentiated from existing and future products and treatments;
* · have commercial quantities of any approved product manufactured at acceptable cost and quality levels and in compliance with FDA and other regulatory requirements;
* · successfully commercialize IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate, if approved;
* · obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from, and negotiate competitive pricing with, third-party payors;
* · successfully collaborate with pharmaceutical companies in the discovery, development and commercialization of new therapies; and
* · avoid regulatory exclusivities or patents held by competitors that may inhibit our products' entry to the market.

The availability of our competitors' products could limit the demand and the price we are able to charge for any product candidate we develop. The inability to compete with existing or subsequently introduced treatments would have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.

Additional time may be required to obtain marketing authorizations for our IMVT-1401 pre-filled syringe product candidate because it would be subject to regulation as a combination product.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Combination products are therapeutic and diagnostic products that combine drugs, devices, and/or biological products. Our IMVT-1401 pre-filled syringe product candidate and our auto-injector product candidate, would be considered a combination product that requires coordination within the FDA and in similar foreign regulatory agencies for review of its device and biologic components. Although the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies have systems in place for the review and approval of combination products such as ours, we may experience delays in the development and commercialization of our product candidate due to uncertainties in the product development and approval process.

Table of Contents
-----------------

The regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and even if we obtain approval for a product candidate in one country or jurisdiction, we may never obtain approval for or commercialize it in any other jurisdiction, which would limit our ability to realize our full market potential.

Prior to obtaining approval to commercialize a product candidate in any jurisdiction, we or our collaborators must demonstrate with substantial evidence from wellcontrolled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory agencies, that such product candidate is safe and effective for its intended use. Results from nonclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we believe the nonclinical or clinical data for a product candidate are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. In order to market any products in any particular jurisdiction, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements on a country-by-country basis regarding safety and efficacy. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in any other country or jurisdiction outside the United States. In addition, clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not guarantee regulatory approval in any other country. Approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation, as well as additional administrative review periods. Seeking regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs for us and require additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials, which could be costly and time consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in those countries. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale in any jurisdiction, including in international markets. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, or if regulatory approvals in international markets are delayed, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of any product we develop will be unrealized.

Our failure to maintain or continuously improve our quality management program could have an adverse effect upon our business, subject us to regulatory actions, cause a loss of patient confidence in us or our products, among other negative consequences.

Quality management plays an essential role in contract manufacturing of drugs or drug products, conducting clinical trials, preventing defects, improving our product candidates and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our product candidates. Our goal is to maintain a robust quality management program which includes the following broad pillars of quality:

* · monitoring and assuring regulatory compliance for clinical trials, manufacturing and testing of GxP products;
* · monitoring and providing oversight of all GxP suppliers (e.g., contract development manufacturing organizations and CROs);
* · establishing and maintaining an integrated, robust quality management system for clinical, manufacturing, supply chain and distribution operations; and
* · cultivating a proactive, preventative quality culture and employee and supplier training to ensure quality.

Our future success depends on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program. A quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports, warning letters, monetary sanctions, injunction to halt manufacture and distribution of drugs or drug products, civil or criminal sanctions, costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity, or a loss of patient confidence in us or our future products, which may result in difficulty in successfully launching product candidates and the loss of potential future sales, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Even if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, we will still face extensive ongoing quality and regulatory compliance requirements and our product may face future development and quality or regulatory compliance difficulties.

Any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements, including for the manufacturing processes, post-approval clinical data, labeling, packaging, distribution, AE reporting, storage, recordkeeping, conduct of potential post-market studies and post-market commitment and requirements, export, import, advertising and promotional activities for such product, among other things, by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, establishment of registration and drug listing requirements, continued compliance with cGMP requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of drug product samples to physicians, recordkeeping and GCP requirements for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. Even if marketing approval of a product candidate is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval or the FDA or other regulatory authorities may require that contraindications, warnings or precautions, including in some cases, a boxed warning be included in the product labeling, which could limit sales of the product. Regulatory authorities closely regulate the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs to ensure drugs are marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Although the FDA and other regulatory agencies do not regulate a physician's choice of drug treatment made in the physician's independent medical judgment, regulatory authorities impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers' communications regarding off-label use, and if we do not market our products for their approved indications, we may be subject to enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in the United States and other comparable regulations in foreign jurisdictions relating to the promotion of prescription drugs may lead to enforcement actions and investigations by the FDA, U.S. Department of Justice, State Attorneys General and other foreign regulatory agencies alleging violations of United States federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws, as well as state consumer protection laws and comparable laws in foreign jurisdictions.

In addition, later discovery of previously unknown AEs or other problems with our product, manufacturers or manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements may yield various results, including:

* · restrictions on the manufacture of such product;
* · restrictions on the labeling or marketing of such product, including a "black box" warning or contraindication on the product label or communications containing warnings or other safety information about the product;
* · restrictions on product distribution or use;
* · requirements to conduct post-marketing studies or clinical trials, or any regulatory holds on our clinical trials;
* · requirement of a REMS or additional risk management plans (or equivalent outside the United States);
* · Warning or Untitled Letters;
* · withdrawal of the product from the market;
* · recall of a product;
* · fines, restitution or disgorgement of profits or revenues;
* · suspension or withdrawal of marketing approvals;
* · refusal to permit the import or export of such product;
* · product seizure; or
* · lawsuits, injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

The FDA and other regulatory authorities' policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or to the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained.

Table of Contents
-----------------

For example, certain policies of the current U.S. administration may impact our business and industry. Namely, the current U.S. administration has taken several executive actions, including the issuance of a number of Executive Orders, that could impose significant burdens on, or otherwise materially delay, the FDA's ability to engage in routine regulatory and oversight activities such as implementing statutes through rulemaking, issuance of guidance, and review and approval of marketing applications. It is difficult to predict how these executive actions, including the Executive Orders will be implemented, and the extent to which they will impact the FDA's ability to exercise its regulatory authority. If these executive actions impose constraints on the FDA's ability to engage in oversight and implementation activities in the normal course, our business may be negatively impacted.

Non-compliance by us or any future collaborator with regulatory requirements, including safety monitoring or pharmacovigilance, and with requirements related to the development of products for the pediatric population can also result in significant financial penalties.

Even if we receive marketing approval for IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate, it may fail to achieve market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors or others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Even if we receive marketing approval for a product candidate, it may nonetheless fail to gain sufficient market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community. If it does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance, we may not generate significant product revenue or become profitable. The degree of market acceptance of any product candidate, if approved for commercial sale, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:

* · the safety, efficacy, risk-benefit profile and potential advantages, including in the case of IMVT-1401 subcutaneous delivery method, compared to alternative, competing or existing treatments, which physicians may perceive to be adequately effective for some or all patients;
* · limitations or warnings contained in the labeling approved for our product candidate by the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities;
* · any restrictions on the use of the product candidate, and the prevalence and severity of any side effects;
* · the content of the approved product label;
* · the effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts;
* · the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments, including any biosimilar treatments;
* · our ability to offer our products for sale at competitive prices;
* · the cost, convenience and ease of administration compared to alternative treatments;
* · the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies over existing or competing therapies;
* · the strength of marketing and distribution support;
* · the availability of third-party coverage and adequate reimbursement at any given price level of our product candidate;
* · utilization controls imposed by third-party payors, such as prior authorizations and step edits; and
* · any restrictions on the use of our product candidate, if approved, together with other medications.

Market acceptance of IMVT-1401 for the treatment of MG, TED and WAIHA may also be affected by the perception that existing available treatments, such as pyridostigmine, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, may be sufficient to treat the majority of these patients. In addition, IMVT-1401, if approved, may compete with other FcRn inhibitors under development that have demonstrated similar levels of IgG reductions as IMVT-1401 in completed clinical trials to date. In addition, the potential patient population for our initial indication and other autoimmune indications that we may target are relatively small. This could affect the rate of adoption and as a result, market acceptance of our product candidate, if approved, could be much slower than anticipated.

Table of Contents
-----------------

We cannot assure you that IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate, if approved, will achieve broad market acceptance among physicians, patients and third-party payors. The failure of any such product candidate that receives regulatory approval or clearance to achieve market acceptance or commercial success would adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We may expend our limited resources to pursue one or more particular indications and fail to capitalize on indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have limited financial and management resources. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future development programs for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. Any such failures would adversely affect our business and results of operations.

If we are unable to establish sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidate, if approved.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We do not currently have any infrastructure for the sales, marketing, or distribution of any product, and the cost of establishing and maintaining such an organization may exceed the cost-effectiveness of doing so. In order to market any product that may be approved, we must build our sales, distribution, marketing, compliance, managerial and other nontechnical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services. To achieve commercial success for any product for which we obtain marketing approval, we will need a sales and marketing organization.

We expect to build a focused sales, distribution and marketing infrastructure to market our product candidate in the United States, if approved. There are significant expenses and risks involved with establishing our own sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, including our ability to hire, retain and appropriately incentivize qualified individuals, develop an appropriate compliance function, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel, and effectively manage geographically dispersed sales and marketing teams to generate sufficient demand. Any failure or delay in the development of our internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities could delay any product launch, which would adversely impact its commercialization. If the commercial launch of our product candidate, if approved, for which we recruit a sales force and establish marketing capabilities is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses. This may be costly, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel.

Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products on our own include:

* · our inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;
* · the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to physicians or attain adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any drugs;
* · the inability to obtain sufficient access and reimbursement for our product candidate, if approved; and
* · unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating a sales and marketing organization.

If we are unable to build our own sales force or negotiate a collaborative relationship for the commercialization of any product candidate, we may be forced to delay potential commercialization or reduce the scope of our sales or marketing activities. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund commercialization activities ourselves, we will need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we will not be able to bring any product candidate to market or generate product revenue. We could enter into arrangements with collaborative partners at an earlier stage than otherwise would be ideal and we may be required to relinquish certain rights to our product candidate or otherwise agree to terms unfavorable to us, any of which may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects.

Table of Contents
-----------------

If we are unable to establish adequate sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we will not be successful in commercializing our product candidate and may not become profitable. We may be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and well-funded marketing and sales operations. Without an internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions, we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies.

We plan to seek orphan drug designation for IMVT-1401, but we may be unable to obtain such designation or to maintain the benefits associated with orphan drug status, including market exclusivity, even if that designation is granted.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We plan to seek orphan drug designation from the FDA for IMVT-1401 for the treatment of MG, TED and WAIHA and potentially in other orphan indications in which there is a medically plausible basis for its use, and we may seek orphan drug designation for IMVT-1401 in the E.U. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the United States. In the E.U., the EMA's Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products assesses orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the E.U. or a serious and chronic condition when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the E.U. would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug or biological product, and where there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment, or, if such a method exists, the medicine must be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition.

In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a sponsor to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. In addition, if a product that has orphan drug designation from the FDA subsequently receives the first FDA approval for a particular active ingredient for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a BLA, to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances such as if the FDA finds that the holder of the orphan drug exclusivity has not shown that it can assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the orphan drug to meet the needs of patients with the disease or condition for which the drug was designated. Similarly, the FDA can subsequently approve a drug with the same active moiety for the same condition during the exclusivity period if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior, meaning the later drug is safer, more effective, or makes a major contribution to patient care. In the E.U., orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity following drug or biological product approval in respect of the approved therapeutic indication if the designation is maintained at the time of granting the E.U. product approval. The 10-year market exclusivity can be extended to 12 years under the E.U. pediatric regulation if the studies contained in an agreed pediatric investigation plan are completed with the data submitted for regulatory review as part of the compliance check. This period of exclusivity may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.

Table of Contents
-----------------

Although we intend to seek orphan drug designation for IMVT-1401 from the FDA and the EMA's Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, we may never receive such designation. Moreover, obtaining orphan drug designation for IMVT-1401 for the treatment of MG, WAIHA or TED does not mean we will be able to obtain such designation for any other indications. Even if we were to obtain orphan drug designation for IMVT-1401 from the FDA or the EMA's Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, we may not be the first to obtain marketing approval for any particular orphan indication due to the uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products, and thus approval of IMVT-1401 could be blocked for seven years if another company obtains approval and orphan drug exclusivity for the same drug and same condition before us. If we do obtain market exclusivity in the United States or in the E.U., they may be limited if we seek approval for an indication broader than the orphan designated indication and may be lost if the FDA or the EMA's Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if we are unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of the relevant patients. Further, exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties can be approved for the same condition, the same drugs can be approved for different indications and might then be used off-label in our approved indication, and different drugs for the same condition may already be approved and commercially available. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the development or FDA or other regulatory agency review and approval process.

If we obtain approval to commercialize our product outside of the United States, a variety of risks associated with international operations could adversely affect our business.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If our product candidate is approved for commercialization outside of the United States, we expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to entering into international business relationships, including:

* · different post-approval regulatory requirements for drug approvals and rules governing drug commercialization in foreign countries;
* · reduced or no protection of intellectual property rights;
* · unexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements;
* · economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets;
* · compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;
* · foreign reimbursement, pricing and insurance regimes;
* · foreign taxes;
* · any foreign partners or collaborators not fulfilling their respective regulatory reporting requirements and any foreign regulatory authorities taking actions with respect to such failures, which would be reportable to the FDA;
* · any foreign partners or collaborators not informing us of any new post-marketing safety signals in a timely manner;
* · foreign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses and reduced revenue, and other obligations incident to doing business in another country;
* · workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;
* · potential noncompliance with the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act or similar antibribery and anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions;
* · production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and
* · business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires.

We have no prior experience in commercializing any product, and many biopharmaceutical companies have found the process of marketing their products in foreign countries to be very challenging.

Our current and future relationships with investigators, health care professionals, consultants, third-party payors, and customers are subject to applicable healthcare regulatory laws, which could expose us to penalties.

Our business operations and current and future arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors, patient support efforts, charitable organizations and customers expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. These laws regulate the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations, including how we research, market, sell, and distribute any product for which we obtain marketing approval. Such laws include, among others:

* · the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which broadly prohibits the exchange of any "remuneration", related to items or services for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute also may constitute a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act, or the FCA;
* · the federal criminal and civil false claims laws, including the FCA, through civil whistleblower or "qui tam" actions, and the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which impose criminal and civil penalties against individuals or entities for, among other things, causing false or fraudulent claims to be presented, for payment to the federal government;
* · the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false or fraudulent statements relating to healthcare matters; similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation;
* · the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other "transfers of value" made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually the ownership and investment interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members, which will be expanded beginning in 2022, to require applicable manufacturers to report such information regarding its payments or other transfers of value made to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives during the previous year;
* · analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to our business practices;
* · state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, and state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, marketing expenditures or drug pricing; and state and local laws require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and
* · federal, state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of personal information, including health information, which may require us to, among other data protection measures, provide notices, obtain individual consents to use and disclose information, give individuals rights with respect to their information, and to keep the information secure. Enforcement of such laws could result in civil and criminal penalties as well as, in some circumstances, damages and related costs in defending private actions, including class actions.

-----------------

Efforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable healthcare laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these or any other health regulatory laws that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs or similar programs in other countries or jurisdictions, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement and curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Even the mere issuance of a subpoena or the fact of an investigation alone, regardless of the merit, may result in negative publicity, a drop in our share price and other harm to our business, financial condition and results of operations. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired.

Changes in healthcare law and implementing regulations, as well as changes in healthcare policy, may impact our business in ways that we cannot currently predict and may have a significant adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There have been, and continue to be, numerous executive, legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Among policy makers and payors in the United States there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, boosting pricing transparency, improving quality and/or expanding access and the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 and related legislation, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the United States pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act, among other things: (1) introduced a new "average manufacturer price" calculation for drugs and biologics that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected and that are not generally dispensed through retail community pharmacies; (2) increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and expanded rebate liability from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well; (3) established a branded prescription drug fee that pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs must pay to the federal government; (4) expanded the list of covered entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program by adding new entities to the program; (5) established a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers currently must now agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable branded drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer's outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; (6) expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals, including individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers' Medicaid rebate liability; (7) created a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products; and (8) established a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending.

There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or TCJA, was enacted, which included a provision that repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the "individual mandate." In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the Affordable Care Act-mandated "Cadillac" tax on high-cost employersponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the Affordable Care Act, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the TCJA, the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that the individual mandate was unconstitutional but remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the case, although it is unknown when a decision will be made or how the Supreme Court will rule. Although the U.S. Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, which began on February 15, 2021 and will remain open through August 15, 2021. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act. On February 10, 2021, the Biden administration withdrew the federal government's support for overturning the Affordable Care Act. Additionally, on March 11, 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminates the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug's average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning January 1, 2024. It is unclear how the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the Affordable Care Act and our business. We are continuing to monitor any changes to the Affordable Care Act that, in turn, may potentially impact our business in the future.

Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011 and subsequent laws, which began in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional Congressional action is taken. These Medicare sequester reductions will be suspended from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. New laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which may materially adversely affect customer demand and affordability for our products and, accordingly, the results of our financial operations.

Also, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which pharmaceutical companies set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed federal legislation, as well as state efforts, designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the former Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, President Trump announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempted to implement several of the former Trump administration proposals. As a result, the FDA released a final rule on September 24, 2020, effective November 30, 2020, implementing a portion of the importation executive order providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed by the Biden administration until January 1, 2023. In addition, on November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing President Trump's Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries. The Most Favored Nation regulations mandate participation by identified Medicare Part B providers and will apply in all U.S. states and territories for a seven-year period beginning January 1, 2021, and ending December 31, 2027. On December 28, 2020, the U.S. District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. However, it is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives.

At the state level, individual states in the United States are increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.

We expect that these and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. It is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs, once marketing approval is obtained.

Coverage and adequate reimbursement may not be available for our product candidate, which could make it difficult for us to sell it profitably, if approved.

Market acceptance and sales of any approved product that we develop will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from third-party payors, including government health administration authorities and private health insurers. There is no assurance that our product candidate, if approved, would achieve adequate coverage and reimbursement levels.

Table of Contents
-----------------

In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. Third-party payors decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any product candidates that we develop through approval will be made on a plan-by-plan basis. One payor's determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and adequate reimbursement for the product. Additionally, a third-party payor's decision to provide coverage for a drug does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Each plan determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a drug, what amount it will pay the manufacturer for the drug, on what tier of its formulary the drug will be placed and whether to require step therapy. The position of a drug on a formulary generally determines the co-payment that a patient will need to make to obtain the drug and can strongly influence the adoption of a drug by patients and physicians. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers prescribing such services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Further, from time to time, typically on an annual basis, payment rates are updated and revised by third-party payors. Such updates could impact the demand for our products, to the extent that patients who are prescribed our products, if approved, are not separately reimbursed for the cost of the product.

The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Even if we do obtain adequate levels of reimbursement, third-party payors, such as government or private healthcare insurers, carefully review and increasingly question the coverage of, and challenge the prices charged for, products. A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that pharmaceutical companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for products. We may also be required to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to justify the coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Inadequate coverage or reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product for which we obtain marketing approval. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available, or are available only to limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any product candidates that we develop. Additionally, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in the United States and in some foreign jurisdictions that could affect our ability to sell any future drugs profitably. There can be no assurance that our product candidate, if approved, will be considered medically reasonable and necessary, that it will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that coverage or an adequate level of reimbursement will be available, or that reimbursement policies and practices in the United States and in foreign countries where our products are sold will not adversely affect our ability to sell our product candidate profitably, if approved for sale.

Risks Related to Our Business, Financial Position and Capital Requirements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our business is heavily dependent on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our sole product candidate, IMVT-1401.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We currently have no products that are approved for commercial sale and may never be able to develop marketable products. We expect that a substantial portion of our efforts and expenditures over the next few years will be devoted to the advancement of IMVT-1401. Accordingly, our business currently depends heavily on the successful completion of our clinical trials for IMVT-1401 and subsequent regulatory approval and commercialization of this product candidate. Delays or failures in the clinical trials for IMVT-1401, for example due to the voluntary pause of our clinical trials announced in February 2021 and resulting inconclusive study results, have and could in the future significantly impact and harm our business. See " Risks Related to Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization - Clinical trials are very expensive, time-consuming, difficult to design and implement, and involve uncertain outcomes ."

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

Table of Contents
-----------------

We cannot be certain that IMVT-1401 will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized even if we receive regulatory approval. The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, sale, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products, including antibody-based products, are, and will remain, subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries that each have differing regulations. We are not permitted to market our product candidate in the United States until we receive approval of a biologics license application, or BLA, or in any foreign country until we receive the requisite approvals from the appropriate authorities in such countries for marketing authorization. In addition, we have not yet demonstrated our ability to complete laterstage or pivotal clinical trials for our product candidate.

We have not submitted a BLA for IMVT-1401 to the FDA or any comparable application to any other regulatory authority. Obtaining approval of a BLA or similar regulatory approval is an extensive, lengthy, expensive and inherently uncertain process, and the FDA or other foreign regulatory authorities may delay, limit or deny approval of IMVT-1401 for many reasons, including:

* · we may not be able to demonstrate that our product candidate is safe and effective as a treatment for any of our currently targeted indications to the satisfaction of the FDA or other relevant regulatory authorities;
* · the relevant regulatory authorities may require additional pre-approval studies or clinical trials, which would increase our costs and prolong our development timelines;
* · the results of our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA or other relevant regulatory authorities for marketing approval;
* · the FDA or other relevant regulatory authorities may disagree with the number, design, size, conduct or implementation of our clinical trials, including the design of our clinical trials of IMVT-1401 for the treatment of MG, TED and WAIHA;
* · the CROs that we retain to conduct clinical trials may take actions outside of our control, or otherwise commit errors or breaches of protocols, that materially adversely impact our clinical trials and ability to obtain market approvals;
* · the FDA or other relevant regulatory authorities may not find the data from nonclinical studies or clinical trials sufficient to demonstrate that the clinical and other benefits of our product candidate outweigh its safety risks;
* · the FDA or other relevant regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data or significance of results from the nonclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidate, or may require additional studies;
* · the FDA or other relevant regulatory authorities may not accept data generated from our clinical trial sites;
* · if our BLA or other foreign application is reviewed by an advisory committee, the FDA or other relevant regulatory authority, as the case may be, may have difficulties scheduling an advisory committee meeting in a timely manner or the advisory committee may recommend against approval of our application or may recommend that the FDA or other relevant regulatory authority, as the case may be, require, as a condition of approval, additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials, limitations on approved labeling or distribution and use restrictions;
* · the FDA or other relevant regulatory authorities may require development of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, or its equivalent, as a condition of approval;
* · the FDA or other relevant regulatory authorities may require additional post-marketing studies and/or a patient registry, which would be costly;
* · the FDA or other relevant regulatory authorities may find the chemistry, manufacturing and controls data insufficient to support the quality of our product candidate;
* · the FDA or other relevant regulatory authorities may identify deficiencies in the manufacturing processes or facilities of our third-party manufacturers; or
* · the FDA or other relevant regulatory authorities may change their approval policies or adopt new regulations.

Table of Contents
-----------------

Even if we do receive regulatory approval to market IMVT-1401, any such approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses or patient populations for which we may market IMVT-1401. Accordingly, even if we are able to obtain the requisite financing to continue to fund our development programs, we cannot assure you that our product candidate will be successfully developed or commercialized.

In addition, if our product candidate encounters safety or efficacy problems, such as the observed lipid findings from our clinical trials of IMVT-1401, developmental delays, regulatory issues, supply issues, or other problems in one of our target indications, our development plans for our product candidate could be significantly harmed in other indications, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, competitors who are developing product candidates in the autoimmune disease field, including IgG-mediated autoimmune indications, or that target the same indications or use the same mechanism of action as us, may experience problems with their product candidates that could suggest problems with our product candidate that would potentially harm our business.

Our business, operations and clinical development plans and timelines and supply chain could be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, on the manufacturing, clinical trials and other business activities performed by us or by third parties with whom we conduct business, including our contract manufacturers, CROs, shippers and others.

Our business could be adversely affected by health epidemics wherever we have clinical trial sites or other business operations. In addition, health epidemics could cause significant disruption in the operations of third-party manufacturers, CROs and other third parties upon whom we rely. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has presented a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is affecting employees, patients, communities and business operations, as well as the U.S. economy and financial markets. Many geographic regions have imposed, or in the future may impose or re-impose, "shelter-in-place" orders, quarantines or similar orders or restrictions to control the spread of COVID-19. Our headquarters is located in New York City, we have business operations in North Carolina, and our contract manufacturers are located in the United States and in South Korea. At present, we have implemented work-from-home policies for all employees. The effects of our work-from-home policy, including any plans to return to the office, may negatively impact productivity, disrupt our business and delay our clinical programs and timelines, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course. These and similar, and perhaps more severe, disruptions in our operations could negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.

We are dependent on a worldwide supply chain for products to be used in our clinical trials and, if approved by the regulatory authorities, for commercialization. Quarantines, shelter-in-place and similar government orders, or the expectation that such orders, shutdowns or other restrictions could occur or re-occur, whether related to COVID-19 or other infectious diseases, could impact personnel at third-party manufacturing facilities in the United States and other countries, or the availability or cost of materials, which could disrupt our supply chain. For example, any manufacturing supply interruption of IMVT-1401, which is currently manufactured at facilities in the United States and in South Korea, or any future product candidates, could adversely affect our ability to conduct clinical trials of IMVT-1401 and any future product candidates. In addition, closures of transportation carriers and modal hubs could materially impact our clinical development and any future commercialization timelines.

If our relationships with our suppliers or other vendors are terminated or scaled back as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or other health epidemics, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative suppliers or vendors or do so on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner. Switching or adding additional suppliers or vendors involves substantial cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new supplier or vendor commences work. As a result, delays generally occur, which could adversely impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development and any future commercialization timelines. Although we strive to carefully manage our relationships with our suppliers and vendors, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects. See " Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties ."

-----------------

Prior to the previously disclosed voluntary pause of our clinical trials, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted clinical site enrollment and some participants' ability to follow office visit schedules and protocols. Given the uncertain course of the pandemic, it is impossible to predict with certainty any future impact it may have on our operations. For example, patient enrollment could be delayed due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic or concerns among patients about participating in clinical trials during a pandemic. Some patients may have difficulty following certain aspects of clinical trial protocols if quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. Similarly, our inability to successfully recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19 or experience additional restrictions by their institutions, city, or state governments could adversely impact our clinical trial operations.

The spread and duration of COVID-19 has also led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which increases the cost of, and adversely impacts access to, capital and increases economic uncertainty. The trading prices for our common stock and other biopharmaceutical companies have, at times, been highly volatile as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, financial results and value of our common stock, it may also affect our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity.

The COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve rapidly. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our clinical trials, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely.

We expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Investment in biopharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that a product candidate will fail to gain regulatory approval or fail to become commercially viable. We have never generated any product revenue, and we cannot estimate with precision the extent of our future losses. We do not currently have any products that are available for commercial sale and we may never generate product revenue or achieve profitability. Our net loss was $107.4 million and $66.4 million for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of March 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $198.7 million.

We expect to continue to incur substantial and increasing losses through the commercialization of IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate, if approved. We currently have no products that are approved for commercial sale. As a result, we are uncertain when or if we will achieve profitability and, if so, whether we will be able to sustain it. Our ability to generate product revenue and achieve profitability is dependent on our ability to complete the development of IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate, obtain necessary regulatory approvals for such product candidate, and manufacture and successfully commercialize such product candidate alone or in collaboration with others. We cannot assure you that we will be profitable even if we successfully commercialize IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate. If we do successfully obtain regulatory approval to market a product candidate, our revenue will be dependent upon, in part and among other things, the size of the markets in the territories for which we gain regulatory approval, the number of competitors in such markets, the accepted price for our product candidate, the reimbursement environment for our product candidate and whether we own the commercial rights for those territories. If the indication approved by regulatory authorities for IMVT1401 or any future product candidate is narrower than we expect, or the treatment population is narrowed by competition, physician choice or treatment guidelines, we may not generate significant revenue from sales of such product candidate, even if approved. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Failure to become and remain profitable may adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock and our ability to raise capital and continue operations.

Table of Contents
-----------------

We expect our research and development expenses in connection with our development program for IMVT-1401 to continue to be significant. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for IMVT-1401, we expect to incur increased sales, marketing and manufacturing expenses. As a result, we expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future. These losses had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and working capital.

We have a limited operating history and have never generated any product revenue.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a limited operating history. We have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully complete a large-scale, pivotal clinical trial, obtain marketing approval, manufacture a commercial scale product, or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf, or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Consequently, we have no meaningful operations upon which to evaluate our business, and predictions about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or a history of successfully developing, manufacturing and commercializing pharmaceutical products, including antibody-based products.

Our ability to generate product revenue and become profitable depends upon our ability to successfully complete the development of, and obtain the necessary regulatory approvals for, IMVT-1401 and any future product candidates. We have never been profitable, have no products approved for commercial sale, and have not generated any product revenue.

Even if we receive regulatory approval for IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate, we do not know when or if we will generate product revenue.

Our ability to generate product revenue depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our ability to:

* · successfully complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for the marketing of IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate in the United States and in other jurisdictions;
* · add operational, financial and management information systems personnel, including personnel to support our clinical, manufacturing and planned future commercialization efforts and operations as a public company;
* · initiate and continue relationships with third-party suppliers and manufacturers and have commercial quantities of IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate manufactured at acceptable cost and quality levels and in compliance with FDA and other regulatory requirements;
* · attract and retain experienced management and advisory teams;
* · raise additional funds when needed and on terms acceptable to us;
* · commercially launch IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate, if approved, whether alone or in collaboration with others, including establishing sales, marketing and distribution systems;
* · set an acceptable price for any approved product and obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors;
* · achieve market acceptance of any approved product in the medical community and with third-party payors and consumers;
* · compete effectively with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies targeting autoimmune disease indications; and
* · maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio.

Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development, including delays in subject enrollment or interruptions in clinical trial supplies or investigational product, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses, or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the FDA or comparable non-U.S. regulatory authorities to perform studies or clinical trials in addition to those that we currently anticipate. Even if IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with its commercial launch. If we cannot successfully execute any one of the foregoing, our business may not succeed, and you may lose some or all of your investment.

Table of Contents
-----------------

We may not be successful in our efforts to identify and acquire or in-license additional product candidates or technologies, or to enter into collaborations or strategic alliances for the development and commercialization of any such future product candidates.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We may seek to identify and acquire or in-license novel product candidates or technologies in the autoimmune disease field. The process by which we identify product candidates and technologies may fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for a number of reasons, including those discussed in these risk factors and also:

* · the process by which we identify and decide to acquire product candidates or technologies, including through the business development support we receive from RSL and its subsidiaries pursuant to the Services Agreements, may not be successful;
* · potential product candidates may, upon further study, be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be products that will receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance;
* · potential product candidates may not be effective in treating their targeted diseases; or
* · the acquisition or in-licensing transactions can entail numerous operational and functional risks, including exposure to unknown liabilities, disruption of our business, incurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to pay transaction consideration or costs, or higher than expected acquisition or integration costs.

We may choose to focus our efforts and resources on a potential product candidate or technology that ultimately proves to be unsuccessful. We also cannot be certain that, following an acquisition or in-licensing transaction, we will achieve the revenue or specific net income that justifies such transaction. Further, time and resources spent identifying, acquiring and developing potential product candidates or technologies may distract management's attention from our primary business or other development programs. If we are unable to identify and acquire suitable product candidates for clinical development, this could adversely impact our business strategy, our financial position and share price.

In the future, we may also decide to collaborate with other pharmaceutical companies for the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates in the United States or other countries or territories of the world. We will face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators. We may not be successful in our efforts to establish a strategic partnership or other alternative arrangements for our product candidates because they may be deemed to be at too early of a stage of development for collaborative effort and third parties may not view our product candidates as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy. If and when we collaborate with a third party for development and commercialization of a product candidate, we can expect to relinquish some or all of the control over the future success of that product candidate to the third party. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for a collaboration will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator's resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator's evaluation of a number of factors.

We will require additional capital to fund our operations, and if we fail to obtain necessary financing, we may not be able to complete the development and commercialization of IMVT-1401.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We expect to spend substantial capital to complete the development of, seek regulatory approvals for, and commercialize IMVT-1401. These expenditures will include costs associated with the HanAll Agreement, pursuant to which we are required to reimburse HanAll for half of budgeted research and development costs incurred by them with respect to IMVT-1401 (up to an aggregate reimbursement amount of $20.0 million), make payments in connection with the achievement of certain regulatory milestones prior to generating any product sales (including the initiation of certain clinical trials for IMVT-1401), make significant further payments upon the achievement of certain sales milestones and make tiered royalty payments in connection with the commercial sale of IMVT-1401, if approved.

Table of Contents
-----------------

We will require additional capital to complete the development and potential commercialization of IMVT-1401, such as costs associated with conducting a programwide data review and developing a program-wide integrated safety strategy. Because the length of time and activities associated with successful development of our product candidate are highly uncertain, we are unable to estimate with certainty the actual funds we will require for development and any approved marketing and commercialization activities. Additional capital may not be available in sufficient amounts or on reasonable terms, if at all, and our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to and volatility in the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Our future funding requirements, both near- and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:

* · the timing, progress, costs and results of our clinical trials for IMVT-1401;
* · the outcome, timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the FDA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities;
* · the cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing our patent claims and other intellectual property rights;
* · the cost of defending potential intellectual property disputes, including patent infringement actions brought by third parties against us or any of our current or future product candidates;
* · the cost of future product candidates or technologies that we may acquire or in-license;
* · the effect of competing market developments;
* · the cost and timing of completion of commercial-scale and other manufacturing activities;
* · the cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate in regions where we choose to commercialize such product candidate on our own; and
* · the initiation, progress, timing and results of our commercialization of our product candidate, if approved for commercial sale.

We do not have any committed external source of funds. If we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of IMVT-1401 and any future product candidates, or potentially discontinue operations altogether. In addition, attempting to secure additional capital may divert the time and attention of our management from day-to-day activities and harm our product candidate development efforts. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and potential commercialization of IMVT1401, we are unable to estimate the associated amounts of increased capital outlays, operating expenditures and capital requirements.

Raising additional funds by issuing equity securities may cause dilution to existing stockholders, raising additional funds through debt financings may involve restrictive covenants, and raising funds through lending and licensing arrangements may restrict our operations or require us to relinquish proprietary rights.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We expect that significant additional capital will be needed in the future to continue our planned operations. Until such time, if ever, that we can generate substantial product revenue, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, strategic alliances and license and development agreements or other collaborations. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders' ownership may experience substantial dilution, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that could adversely affect the rights of a common stockholder. Additionally, any agreements for future debt or preferred equity financings, if available, may involve covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.

Table of Contents
-----------------

If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our future revenue streams, research programs or IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts, or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise develop and market ourselves.

We rely on the HanAll Agreement to provide rights to the core intellectual property relating to IMVT-1401. Any termination or loss of significant rights under the HanAll Agreement would adversely affect our development or commercialization of IMVT-1401.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have licensed our core intellectual property relating to IMVT-1401 from HanAll under the HanAll Agreement. If, for any reason, the HanAll Agreement is terminated or we otherwise lose those rights, it would adversely affect our business. The HanAll Agreement imposes on us obligations relating to exclusivity, territorial rights, development, commercialization, funding, payment, diligence, sublicensing, insurance, intellectual property protection and other matters. We are also required to reimburse HanAll for half of budgeted research and development costs incurred by them with respect to IMVT-1401, up to an aggregate reimbursement amount of $20.0 million. If we breach any material obligations, or use the intellectual property licensed to us in an unauthorized manner, under the HanAll Agreement, we may be required to pay damages to our collaborators and they may have the right to terminate the applicable licenses, which would result in us being unable to develop, manufacture and sell IMVT-1401, if approved.

The HanAll Agreement obligates us to make certain milestone payments, some of which may be triggered prior to our potential commercialization of IMVT-1401.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We will be responsible for future contingent payments and royalties under the HanAll Agreement, including up to an aggregate of $442.5 million upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestone events, which events will occur prior to our planned commercialization of IMVT-1401. Accordingly, we will be required to make such payments prior to the time at which we are able to generate any revenue, if any, from commercial sales of IMVT-1401. There can be no assurance that we will have the funds necessary to make such payments, or be able to raise such funds when needed, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. As a result, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts.

We may not be able to manage our business effectively if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We may not be able to attract or retain qualified management and commercial, scientific and clinical personnel due to the intense competition for qualified personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other businesses. If we are not able to attract and retain necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives, we may experience constraints that will significantly impede the achievement of our development objectives, our ability to raise additional capital and our ability to implement our business strategies.

We are highly dependent on the skills and leadership of our senior management team and key employees. Our senior management and key employees may terminate their positions with us at any time. If we lose one or more members of our senior management team or key employees, our ability to successfully implement our business strategies could be adversely affected. Replacing these individuals may be difficult, cause disruption and may take an extended period of time due to the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to develop, manufacture, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize products successfully. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate additional key personnel. We do not maintain "key person" insurance for any members of our senior management team or other employees.

We plan to expand our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing this growth, which could disrupt our operations.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We expect to hire, either directly, or through any current or future subsidiaries of ours, additional employees for our managerial, finance and accounting, legal, clinical, scientific and engineering, regulatory, operational, manufacturing, medical affairs, business development and sales and marketing teams.

Table of Contents
-----------------

We may have difficulties identifying, hiring and integrating new personnel. Future growth would impose significant additional responsibilities on our management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain, motivate and integrate additional employees, consultants and contractors, including training additional qualified personnel. Also, our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these growth activities. We may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations across our entities, which may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Our expected growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of IMVT-1401 and any future product candidate. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our ability to generate or grow revenue could be reduced, and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate and compete effectively will partly depend on our ability to effectively manage any future growth.

Many of the other pharmaceutical companies we compete against for qualified personnel and consultants have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a longer operating history in the industry than we do. They also may provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these opportunities may be more appealing to high-quality candidates and consultants than what we have to offer. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain highquality personnel and consultants, the rate and success at which we can develop product candidates and our business will be harmed.

Our or our affiliates' employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, commercial collaborators, service providers and other vendors or potential collaborators may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

We are exposed to the risk that our or our affiliates' employees and contractors, including principal investigators, CROs, consultants, commercial collaborators, service providers and other vendors may engage in misconduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless or negligent conduct or other unauthorized activities that violate the laws and regulations of the FDA or other similar regulatory bodies, including those laws that require the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such regulatory bodies; manufacturing and the good clinical practice, or GCP, or current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, standards; federal, state and foreign healthcare fraud and abuse laws and data privacy; or laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data. In particular, sales, marketing and other business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws intended to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing, bribery, corruption, antitrust violations and other abusive practices. These laws may restrict or prohibit a wide range of business activities, including research, manufacturing, distribution, pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use or misrepresentation of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, creating fraudulent data in our nonclinical studies or clinical trials or illegal misappropriation of drug product, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee or third-party misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with such laws or regulations.

Table of Contents
-----------------

Additionally, we are subject to the risk that a person, including any person who may have engaged in any fraud or misconduct, or government agency could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. Furthermore, we rely on our CROs and clinical trial sites to adequately report data from our clinical trials. For example, any failure by such parties to adequately report safety signals to us in a timely manner from any such trials may also affect the approvability of our product candidate or cause delays and disruptions for the approval of our product candidate, if at all. If our or our affiliates' employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants, commercial collaborators, service providers or other vendors are alleged or found to be in violation of any such regulatory standards or requirements, or become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement and curtailment of our operations, it could have a significant impact on our business and financial results, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, suspension or delay in our clinical trials, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs, FDA debarment, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and additional reporting requirements and oversight, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.

International expansion of our business exposes us to business, legal, regulatory, political, operational, financial and economic risks associated with conducting business outside of the United States.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part of our business strategy involves potentially expanding internationally with third-party collaborators to seek regulatory approval for IMVT-1401 and any future product candidates outside the United States. Doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including but not limited to:

* · multiple conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses;
* · failure by us or our collaborators to obtain appropriate licenses or regulatory approvals for the sale or use of our product candidates, if approved, in various countries;
* · delays or interruptions in the supply of clinical trial materials resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad, including those that may result from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;
* · difficulties in managing foreign operations;
* · complexities associated with managing multiple payor-reimbursement regimes or self-pay systems;
* · financial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;
* · reduced protection for intellectual property rights;
* · natural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism and political unrest, outbreak of disease, including the COVID-19 pandemic and related shelter-in-place orders, travel, social distancing and quarantine policies, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions; and
* · failure to comply with the FCPA, including its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions, the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010, or the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar antibribery and anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions, for example by failing to maintain accurate information and control over sales or distributors' activities.

Any of these risks, if encountered, could significantly harm our future international expansion and operations and, consequently, negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to stringent and changing privacy and data security laws, contractual obligations, self-regulatory schemes, government regulation, and standards related to data privacy and security. The actual or perceived failure by us, our customers, partners or vendors to comply with such obligations could harm our reputation, subject us to significant fines and liability, disrupt our clinical trials, or otherwise adversely affect our business.

We collect, receive, store, process, use, generate, transfer, disclose, make accessible, protect and share personal information and other information, including information we collect about patients and healthcare providers in connection with clinical trials in the U.S. and abroad ("Process" or "Processing") necessary to operate our business, for legal and marketing purposes, and for other business-related purposes.

There are numerous federal, state, local, and foreign laws, regulations, and guidance regarding privacy, information security and Processing ("Data Protection Laws"), the number and scope of which is changing, subject to differing applications and interpretations, and which may be inconsistent among jurisdictions, or in conflict with other rules, laws or Data Protection Obligations (defined below).

For example, U.S. states have increasingly begun to introduce comprehensive privacy legislation. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA"), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, affords consumers expanded privacy protections. Aspects of the CCPA and its interpretation and enforcement remain uncertain. The potential effects of the CCPA are far-reaching and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. For example, the CCPA gives California residents expanded rights to access and require deletion of their personal information, opt-out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches and statutory damages ranging from $100 to $750 per violation, which is expected to increase data breach class action litigation and result in significant exposure to costly legal judgements and settlements. The CCPA will be expanded substantially on January 1, 2023, when the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 ("CPRA") becomes fully operative. The CPRA will, among other things, give California residents the ability to limit use of certain sensitive personal information, further restrict the use of cross-contextual advertising, establish restrictions on the retention of personal information, expand the types of data breaches subject to the CCPA's private right of action, provide for increased penalties for CPRA violations concerning California residents under the age of 16, and establish a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law. While certain clinical trial activities are exempt from the CCPA's requirements, other personal information that we handle may be subject to the CCPA, which may increase our compliance costs, exposure to regulatory enforcement action, and other liabilities.

We also expect that there will continue to be new or amended laws, regulations, and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection, and information security proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions. For example, in May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") went into effect in the EU. The GDPR imposes more stringent data protection requirements and requires us to give more detailed disclosures about how we collect, use and share personal information; contractually commit to data protection measures in our contracts with clients; maintain adequate data security measures; notify regulators and affected individuals of certain data breaches; meet extensive privacy governance and documentation requirements; and honor individuals' data protection rights, including their rights to access, correct and delete their personal information. The GDPR provides greater penalties for noncompliance than previous data protection laws. Companies that violate the GDPR can face private litigation, restrictions on data processing, and fines of up to the greater of 20 million Euros or 4% of their worldwide annual revenue. Our or our customers', partners', or vendors' failure to comply with the GDPR could lead to significant fines imposed by regulators or restrictions on our ability to process personal information as needed to provide our product and services or conduct clinical trials in the EU. We may also be obligated to assist our customers, partners, and vendors with their own compliance obligations under the GDPR, which could require expenditure of significant resources. Assisting our customers, partners, and vendors in complying with the GDPR, or complying with the GDPR ourselves, may cause us to incur substantial operational costs or require us to change our business practices.

In addition, it is unclear whether the transfer of personal information from the EU to the United Kingdom ("U.K.") will continue to remain lawful under the GDPR in light of Brexit. Pursuant to a post-Brexit trade deal between the U.K. and the EU, transfers of personal information from the EEA to the U.K. are not considered restricted transfers under the GDPR for a period of up to six months from January 1, 2021. However, unless the E.U. Commission makes an adequacy finding with respect to the U.K. before the end of that period, the U.K. will be considered a "third country" under the GDPR and transfers of European personal information to the U.K. will require an adequacy mechanism to render such transfers lawful under the GDPR. Additionally, although U.K. privacy, data protection and data security law is designed to be consistent with the GDPR, uncertainty remains regarding how data transfers to and from the U.K. will be regulated notwithstanding Brexit.

In addition, the GDPR includes restrictions on cross-border data transfers. A recent decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union (the "Schrems II" ruling), however, has invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, which was one of the primary mechanisms used by U.S. companies to import personal information from Europe, and raised questions about whether the European Commission's Standard Contractual Clauses ("SCCs"), one of the primary alternatives to the Privacy Shield, can lawfully be used for personal information transfers from Europe to the United States or most other countries. Similarly, the Swiss Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner recently opined that the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield is inadequate for transfers of data from Switzerland to the U.S. The United Kingdom, whose data protection laws are similar to those of the European Union, may similarly determine that the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield is not a valid mechanism for lawfully transferring personal information from the UK to the United States. The European Commission recently proposed updates to the SCCs, and additional regulatory guidance has been released that seeks to impose additional obligations on companies seeking to rely on the SCCs. Given that, at present, there are few, if any, viable alternatives to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the SCCs, any transfers by us or our vendors of personal data from Europe may not comply with European data protection law, which may increase our exposure to the GDPR's heightened sanctions for violations of its cross-border data transfer restrictions and may prohibit our transfer of EU personal data outside of the EU (including clinical trial data), and may adversely impact our operations, product development and ability to provide our products.

We are also subject to the terms of our external and internal privacy and security policies, representations, certifications, standards, publications and frameworks ("Privacy Policies"), and contractual obligations to third parties related to privacy, information security and Processing ("Data Protection Obligations"), including without limitation, operating rules and standards imposed by industry organizations.

Data Protection Laws and data protection worldwide is, and is likely to remain, uncertain for the foreseeable future. We strive to comply with applicable Data Protection Laws, Privacy Policies and Data Protection Obligations to the extent possible, but we may at times fail to do so, or may be perceived to have failed to do so. Moreover, despite our efforts, we may not be successful in achieving compliance if our personnel, partners, or vendors do not comply with applicable Data Protection Laws, Privacy Policies, and Data Protection Obligations.

If we, our vendors, or business partners fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with applicable Data Protection Laws, Privacy Policies, and Data Protection Obligations, or if our Privacy Policies are, in whole or part, found to be inaccurate, incomplete, deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices, it could: increase our compliance and operational costs; expose us to regulatory scrutiny, actions, fines and penalties; result in reputational harm; lead to a loss of customers; reduce the use of our products; interrupt or stop clinical trials; result in litigation and liability; result in an inability to process personal data or to operate in certain jurisdictions; cause a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial results; or otherwise result in a material adverse effect on our business.

With applicable Data Protection Laws, Privacy Policies and Data Protection Obligations imposing complex and burdensome obligations, and with substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application of these requirements, we have faced and may face additional challenges in addressing and complying with these obligations and making necessary changes to our Privacy Policies and practices, and may incur material costs and expenses in an effort to do so, any of which could materially adversely affect our business operations and financial results, and may limit the adoption and use of, and reduce the overall demand for, our products, which could have an adverse impact on our business.

Table of Contents
-----------------

We may in the future receive inquiries or be subject to investigations, proceedings or actions, by various government entities regarding our privacy and information security practices and Processing ("Regulatory Proceedings"). These Regulatory Proceedings could result in a material adverse effect on our business, including without limitation, interruptions of or require changes to our business practices, the diversion of resources and the attention of management from our business, regulatory oversights and audits, discontinuance of necessary Processing, or other remedies that adversely affect our business (See Part I, Item 3 "Legal Proceedings" for additional information). We may in the future face litigation regarding our privacy and information security practices and Processing, including without limitation, class action litigation, which could result in a material adverse effect on our business.

If our security measures are compromised now, or in the future, or the security, confidentiality, integrity or availability of, our information technology, software, services, communications or data is compromised, limited or fails, this could result in a material adverse effect on our business, including without limitation, a material interruption to our operations, harm to our reputation, significant fines, penalties and liability, breach or triggering of Data Protection Laws, Privacy Policies and Data Protection Obligations, or material disruption of our clinical trials or other business activity.

In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, process, and store proprietary, confidential, and sensitive information, including personal information (including health information), intellectual property, trade secrets, and proprietary business information owned or controlled by ourselves or other parties ("Sensitive Information.")

We may use third-party service providers and subprocessors to help us operate our business and engage in Processing on our behalf, such as RSL and its affiliates, our CROs, and other contractors. We may also share Sensitive Information with our partners or other third parties in conjunction with our business. If we, our service providers, partners or other relevant third parties have experienced, or in the future experience, any security incident(s) that result in, any data loss, deletion or destruction, unauthorized access to, loss of, unauthorized acquisition or disclosure of, or inadvertent exposure or disclosure of, Sensitive Information, or compromise related to the security, confidentiality, integrity or availability of our (or their) information technology, software, services, communications or data (collectively a "Security Breach"), it may result in a material adverse effect on our business, including without limitation, disruptions of our drug development programs, delays in our regulatory approval efforts, regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, litigation, indemnity obligations, negative publicity, and financial loss.

Cyberattacks, malicious internet-based activity and online and offline fraud are prevalent and continue to increase. In addition to traditional computer "hackers," threat actors, software bugs, malicious code (such as viruses and worms), employee theft or misuse, denial-of-service attacks (such as credential stuffing), and ransomware attacks, sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors now engage in attacks (including advanced persistent threat intrusions). We may also be the subject of phishing attacks, viruses, malware installation, server malfunction, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other computer assets, adware or other similar issues. Moreover, security incidents can result in the diversion of funds, and interruptions, delays, or outages in our operations and services, including due to ransomware attacks, which have increased in frequency and severity.

We may be required to expend significant resources, fundamentally change our business activities and practices, or modify our operations (including our clinical trial activities) or information technology in an effort to protect against Security Breaches and to mitigate, detect, and remediate actual and potential vulnerabilities. Applicable Data Protection Laws, Privacy Policies and Data Protection Obligations may require us to implement specific security measures or use industry-standard or reasonable measures to protect against Security Breaches. While we have implemented security measures designed to protect against Security Breaches, there can be no assurance that our security measures or those of our service providers, partners and other third parties, will be effective in protecting against all Security Breaches and material adverse effects on our business that may arise from such breaches. The recovery systems, security protocols, network protection mechanisms and other security measures that we (and our third parties) have integrated into our platform, systems, networks and physical facilities, which are designed to protect against, detect and minimize Security Breaches, may not be adequate to prevent or detect service interruption, system failure, or data loss.

Table of Contents
-----------------

We have not always been able in the past and may be unable in the future to detect, anticipate, measure or prevent threats or techniques used to detect or exploit vulnerabilities in our (or our service providers, partners or other relevant third parties') information technology, services, communications or software, or cause Security Breaches, because such threats and techniques change frequently, are often sophisticated in nature, and may not be detected until after an incident has occurred. In addition, security researchers and other individuals have in the past and will continue in the future to actively search for and exploit actual and potential vulnerabilities in our (or our third parties') information technology and communications. We cannot be certain that we will be able to address any such vulnerabilities, in whole or part, and there may be delays in developing and deploying patches and other remedial measures to adequately address vulnerabilities.

Applicable Data Protection Laws, Privacy Policies and Data Protection Obligations may require us to notify relevant stakeholders of Security Breaches, including affected individuals, customers, regulators and credit reporting agencies. Such disclosures are costly, and the disclosures or the failure to comply with such requirements, could lead to material adverse effects on our business, including without limitation, negative publicity, a loss of customer confidence in our services or security measures or breach of contract claims. There can be no assurance that the limitations of liability in our contracts would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from liabilities or damages if we fail to comply with Applicable Data Protection Laws, Privacy Policies or Data Protection Obligations related to information security or Security Breaches.

Failures or significant downtime of our information technology or telecommunication systems or those used by our third-party service providers could cause significant interruptions in our operations and adversely impact the confidentiality, integrity and availability of sensitive or confidential information, including preventing us from conducting clinical trials, tests or research and development activities and preventing us from managing the administrative aspects of our business.

While we maintain general liability insurance coverage and coverage for errors or omissions, we cannot assure that such coverage will be adequate or otherwise protect us from or adequately mitigate liabilities or damages with respect to claims, costs, expenses, litigation, fines, penalties, business loss, data loss, regulatory actions or material adverse effects on our business arising out of our privacy and security practices, Processing or Security Breaches we may experience, or that such coverage will continue to be available on acceptable terms or at all. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceeds our available insurance coverage, or results in changes to our insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements), could have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, we cannot be sure that our existing insurance coverage and coverage for errors and omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms or that our insurers will not deny coverage as to any future claim.

Potential product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and limit commercialization of any products that we may develop.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The use of IMVT-1401 and any future product candidate in clinical trials and the sale of any products for which we obtain marketing approval exposes us to the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers, health care providers, other pharmaceutical companies, government authorities or others taking or otherwise coming into contact with any approved products. On occasion, large monetary judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits where drugs have had unanticipated adverse effects. If we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liability and costs. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:

* · impairment of our business reputation and significant negative media attention;
* · delay or termination of clinical trials, or withdrawal of participants from our clinical trials;
* · significant costs to defend related litigation;
* · distraction of management's attention from our primary business;
* · substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;
* · inability to commercialize any product candidate, if approved;
* · product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;

Table of Contents
-----------------

* · decreased demand for any product candidate, if approved; and
* · loss of revenue.

The product liability insurance we currently carry, and any additional product liability insurance coverage we acquire in the future, may not be sufficient to reimburse us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and in the future we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. If we obtain marketing approval for IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate, we intend to acquire insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products; however, we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or in adequate amounts. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our share price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could adversely affect our results of operations and business, including preventing or limiting the commercialization any approved product.

Disruptions at the FDA and other government agencies caused by funding shortages or global health concerns could hinder their ability to hire, retain or deploy key leadership and other personnel, or otherwise prevent new or modified products from being developed, approved or commercialized in a timely manner or at all, which could negatively impact our business.

The ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, statutory, regulatory, and policy changes, the FDA's ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and other events that may otherwise affect the FDA's ability to perform routine functions. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs and biologics or modifications to approved drugs and biologics to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, including for 35 days beginning on December 22, 2018, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical FDA employees and stop critical activities.

Separately, in response to the global pandemic of COVID-19, on March 10, 2020 the FDA announced its intention to postpone most foreign inspections of manufacturing facilities and products, and regulatory authorities outside the United States have adopted similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The FDA is continuing to evaluate and utilize alternative regulatory tools while postponing non-critical inspections. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns continue to prevent the FDA or other regulatory authorities from conducting their regular inspections, reviews, or other regulatory activities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties
------------------------------------------------

We do not have our own manufacturing capabilities and will rely on third parties to produce clinical supplies and commercial supplies of our product candidate. The manufacture of biologics is complex and we or our third-party manufacturers may encounter difficulties in production, or our quality management program fails to detect quality issues at our third-party manufacturers, that may delay or prevent our ability to obtain marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates, after approval.

We have no experience in biologic manufacturing and do not own or operate, and we do not expect to own or operate, facilities for product manufacturing, storage and distribution or testing. Third-party vendors may be difficult to identify for our product candidate process and formulation development and manufacturing due to special capabilities required, and they may not be able to meet our quality standards. Any significant delay in the supply of a product candidate, or the raw material components thereof, or in placebo controls for an ongoing clinical trial due to the need to replace a third-party manufacturer could considerably delay completion of our clinical trials, product testing and potential regulatory approval of IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate. If our manufacturers or we are unable to purchase these raw materials after regulatory approval has been obtained for any product candidate, the commercial launch of such product candidate would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply, due to COVID-19 or otherwise, which would impair our ability to generate revenue from the sale of such product candidate. In addition, IMVT-1401 is a biologic and requires processing steps that are more difficult than those required for most chemical pharmaceuticals. Accordingly, multiple steps are needed to control the manufacturing processes. Our future success depends on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program to monitor the manufacturing processes used by third-party manufacturers and our reliance on third-party manufacturers does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. Problems with these manufacturing processes, even minor deviations from the normal process or from the materials used in the manufacturing process, which may not be detectable by us in a timely manner, could lead to product defects or manufacturing failures, resulting in lot failures, product recalls, product liability claims and insufficient inventory. A quality or safety issue emanating from manufacturing failures may result in adverse inspection reports, warning letters, monetary sanctions, injunction to halt manufacture and distribution of drugs or drug products, civil or criminal sanctions, costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses.

The facilities used by our contract manufacturers to manufacture our product candidate must be approved by the FDA pursuant to inspections that will be conducted after we submit our BLA to the FDA. We do not control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with cGMP requirements for manufacture of drug products. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, we will not be able to secure or maintain regulatory approval for our product candidates. In addition, we have no control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. If the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities do not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidate or if they withdraw any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which could significantly impact our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidate, if approved. Further, our reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks, including:

* · inability to meet our product specifications and quality requirements consistently;
* · delay or inability to procure or expand sufficient manufacturing capacity;
* · manufacturing and product quality issues related to scale-up of manufacturing, which can be difficult for a biologic product;
* · costs and validation of new equipment and facilities required for scale-up;
* · failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and standards, including cGMP and similar foreign standards;
* · deficient or improper record-keeping;
* · inability to negotiate manufacturing agreements with third parties under commercially reasonable terms;

Table of Contents
-----------------

* · potential disputes with third parties that might delay work under third-party contracts;
* · termination or nonrenewal of manufacturing agreements with third parties in a manner or at a time that is costly or damaging to us;
* · reliance on a limited number of sources, and in some cases, single sources for product components, such that if we are unable to secure a sufficient supply of these product components, we will be unable to manufacture and sell any product candidate, if approved, in a timely fashion, in sufficient quantities or under acceptable terms;
* · lack of qualified backup suppliers for those components that are currently purchased from a sole or single source supplier;
* · operations of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers could be disrupted by conditions unrelated to our business or operations, including the bankruptcy of the manufacturer or supplier or other regulatory sanctions related to the manufacture of another company's products;
* · carrier disruptions or increased costs that are beyond our control; and
* · failure to deliver our products under specified storage conditions and in a timely manner.

Any of these events could lead to clinical trial delays, cost overruns, delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval or impact our ability to successfully commercialize our products, as well as potential product liability litigation, product recalls or product withdrawals. Some of these events could be the basis for FDA or other regulatory authority action, including injunction, recall, seizure, or total or partial suspension of production.

We are reliant on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical trials, and if those third parties perform in an unsatisfactory manner or fail to comply with applicable requirements, or our quality management program fails to detect such events in a timely manner, it may harm our business.

We currently do not have the ability to independently conduct nonclinical studies that comply with GLP requirements. We also do not currently have the ability to independently conduct any clinical trials. We rely exclusively on CROs and clinical trial sites, which need to comply with GCP, to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials, and we have limited influence over their actual performance.

We rely upon CROs to monitor and manage data for our clinical programs, as well as for the execution of nonclinical studies. We control only certain aspects of our CROs' activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities.

We and our CROs are required to comply with GLP and GCP regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, and are also required by the competent authorities of the member states of the European Economic Area and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities to comply with the International Council for Harmonization guidelines for any of our product candidates that are in nonclinical and clinical development. The regulatory authorities enforce GCP regulations through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. Although we rely on CROs to conduct our GLP-compliant nonclinical studies and GCPcompliant clinical trials, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our nonclinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its investigational plan and protocol and applicable laws and regulations, and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. Therefore, the success of our clinical trials depends on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program to monitor our CROs' compliance with applicable regulations. If we or our CROs fail to comply with GCP requirements, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may reject our marketing applications or require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. Accordingly, if we or our CROs fail to comply with these regulations or other applicable laws, regulations or standards, or fail to recruit a sufficient number of subjects, we may be required to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the relevant regulatory approval process. Failure by our CROs to properly execute study protocols in accordance with applicable law could also create product liability and healthcare regulatory risks for us as sponsors of those studies. Further, our or our CROs' inability to address a quality or safety issue may result in, among others, adverse inspection reports, warning letters, civil or criminal sanctions, costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses.

Table of Contents
-----------------

While we will have agreements governing their activities, our CROs are not our employees, and we will not control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our future clinical and nonclinical programs. These CROs may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials, or other drug development activities, which could harm our competitive position. We face the risk of potential unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of our intellectual property by CROs, which may reduce our trade secret and intellectual property protection and allow our potential competitors to access and exploit our proprietary technology. If our CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our (or their own) clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for any other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize any product candidate that we develop. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for any product candidate that we develop could be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.

If our relationships with these CROs terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or do so on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner. Switching or adding additional CROs involves substantial cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which could adversely impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we carefully manage our relationships with our CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and prospects.

Changes in methods of product candidate manufacturing or formulation may result in additional costs or delay.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As product candidates proceed through nonclinical studies to late-stage clinical trials towards potential approval and commercialization, it is common that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods and formulation, are altered along the way in an effort to optimize processes and results. Such changes carry the risk that they will not achieve these intended objectives. Any of these changes could cause IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate to perform differently and affect the results of planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials conducted with the altered materials. Such changes may also require additional testing, FDA notification or FDA approval or similar. This could delay completion of clinical trials, require the conduct of bridging clinical trials or the repetition of one or more clinical trials, increase clinical trial costs, delay approval of IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate or jeopardize our ability to commence sales and generate revenue.

Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property
------------------------------------------

Our product candidate for which we intend to seek approval as biologic products may face competition sooner than anticipated.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the United States, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. New biologics, such as IMVT-1401, may be entitled to regulatory exclusivity under the BPCIA. The BPCIA grants new biologics 12 years of FDA-granted exclusivity. Further, under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first licensed by the FDA. During the period of exclusivity, however, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a full BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor's own clinical data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of their product. After the expiration of the exclusivity period, the FDA can approve a biosimilar product through an abbreviated approval process. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation and meaning are subject to uncertainty.

We believe that our product candidate, IMVT-1401, as a biological product, should qualify for the 12-year period of exclusivity. However, there is a risk that this exclusivity could be shortened due to congressional action or otherwise, or that the FDA will not consider our product candidate to be a reference product for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.

If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for IMVT-1401 or any future product candidates, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We rely, and will continue to rely, upon a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, collaborators, advisors and other third parties to protect the intellectual property related to our brand, current and future drug development programs and product candidates. Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to IMVT-1401 and any future product candidates. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our current and future drug development programs and product candidates, successfully defending our intellectual property rights against third-party challenges and successfully enforcing our intellectual property rights to prevent third-party infringement. The patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner.

It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. We may choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations or products and may choose not to pursue patent protection in certain jurisdictions, and under the laws of certain jurisdictions, patents or other intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in scope and, in any event, any patent protection we obtain may be limited. We generally apply for patents in those countries where we intend to make, have made, use, offer for sale, or sell products and where we assess the risk of infringement to justify the cost of seeking patent protection. However, we do not seek protection in all countries where we intend to sell products and we may not accurately predict all the countries where patent protection would ultimately be desirable. If we fail to timely file a patent application in any such country or major market, we may be precluded from doing so at a later date. We may also make statements to regulatory agencies during the regulatory approval process that may be inconsistent with positions that have been taken during prosecution of our patents, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable.

The patent applications that we in-license in the United States or in other foreign countries may fail to result in issued patents with claims that protect our product candidates or result in patents that are narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable following challenge in certain jurisdictions. We cannot guarantee any current or future patents will provide us with any meaningful protection or competitive advantage. There is no assurance that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found, which can prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application or be used to invalidate an issued patent. The examination process may require us to narrow our claims, which may limit the scope of any patent protection we obtain. Even if patents do successfully issue based on our patent applications, and even if such patents cover our product candidates, uses of our product candidates or other aspects related to our product candidates, third parties may challenge their validity, ownership, enforceability or scope, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable or circumvented, any of which could limit our ability to prevent competitors and other third parties from developing and marketing similar products or limit the length of terms of patent protection we may have for our product candidates, if approved, and technologies. Other companies may also design around our patents. Third parties may have blocking patents that could prevent us from marketing our product candidates, if approved, or practicing our own patented technology. Further, if we encounter delays in regulatory approvals, the period of time during which we could market a product candidate while under patent protection could be reduced. If any of our patents expire or are challenged, invalidated, circumvented or otherwise limited by third parties prior to the commercialization of our product candidates, and if we do not own or have exclusive rights to other enforceable patents protecting our product candidates, competitors and other third parties could market products that are substantially similar to ours and our business would suffer.

-----------------

If the patent applications we hold or have in-licensed with respect to our development programs and product candidates fail to issue, if their breadth or strength of protection is threatened, or if they fail to provide meaningful exclusivity for our product candidate, IMVT-1401, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to develop our product candidate and threaten our ability to commercialize future drugs. Any such outcome could have an adverse effect on our business. Our pending patent applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications.

The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies is generally highly uncertain, involves complex legal, scientific and factual questions, and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation. The standards that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and its foreign counterparts use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions.

Patent reform legislation in the United States could increase those uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents. For example, the Leahy Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law in 2011 and includes a number of significant changes to U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications are prosecuted, redefine prior art and provide more efficient and cost-effective avenues for competitors to challenge the validity of patents. These include allowing third-party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and additional procedures to attack the validity of a patent by USPTO administered post-grant proceedings, including post-grant review, inter partes review, and derivation proceedings. After March 2013, under the Leahy-Smith Act, the United States transitioned to a first inventor to file system in which, assuming that the other statutory requirements are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether a third party was the first to invent the claimed invention.

Publications of discoveries in scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases not until a patent issues. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our owned or licensed patents or pending patent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect IMVT-1401 or any future product candidates, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive products. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may diminish the value of our patents or narrow the scope of our patent protection.

Moreover, we may be subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the USPTO or become involved in opposition, derivation, reexamination, inter partes review, post-grant review or interference proceedings challenging our owned or licensed patent rights. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, allow third parties to commercialize IMVT-1401 or any future product candidates and compete directly with us, without payment to us, or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize IMVT-1401 or any future product candidates.

Table of Contents
-----------------

The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity or enforceability, and our owned and licensed patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices, both in the United States and abroad. Such challenges may result in loss of exclusivity or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our products. Moreover, patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. In certain instances, the patent term may be adjusted to add additional days to compensate for delays incurred by the USPTO in issuing the patent. Also, the patent term may be extended for a period of time to compensate for at least a portion of the time a product candidate was undergoing FDA regulatory review. However, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Without patent protection for IMVT1401 or any future product candidates, we may be open to competition from generic versions of such products. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.

The validity, scope and enforceability of any patents that cover a biologic subject to approval by the FDA via a BLA, such as IMVT-1401, can be challenged by third parties.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For biologics subject to approval by the FDA via a BLA, such as IMVT-1401, the BPCIA provides a mechanism for one or more third parties to seek FDA approval to manufacture or sell a biosimilar or interchangeable versions of brand name biological products. Due to the large size and complexity of biological products, as compared to small molecules, a biosimilar must be "highly similar" to the reference product with "no clinically meaningful differences between the two." The BPCIA, requires a formal pre-litigation process which includes the exchange of information between a biosimilar applicant and a reference biologic sponsor that includes the identification of relevant patents and each parties' basis for infringement and invalidity. After the exchange of this information, we may then initiate a lawsuit within 30 days to defend the patents identified in the exchange. If the biosimilar applicant successfully challenges the asserted patent claims it could result in the invalidation of, or render unenforceable, some or all of the relevant patent claims or result in a finding of non-infringement. Such litigation or other proceedings to enforce or defend intellectual property rights are often very complex in nature, may be very expensive and time-consuming, may divert our management's attention from our core business, and may result in unfavorable results that could limit our ability to prevent third parties from competing with IMVT-1401 or any future product candidates.

We may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Filing, prosecuting and defending patents on any of our product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and even in countries where we have sought protection for our intellectual property, such protection may be less extensive than that provided in the United States. The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries, and the breadth of patent claims allowed can be inconsistent. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect patent rights to the same extent as federal laws in the United States. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in certain jurisdictions. Competitors may exploit our inventions in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and may also export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but where enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our products and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.

We do not have patent rights in certain foreign countries in which a market may exist. Moreover, in foreign jurisdictions where we may obtain patent rights, proceedings to enforce such rights could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, and our patent applications at risk of not issuing. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly, could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Thus, we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing and selling in foreign countries products and services that are the same as or similar to our products and services, and our competitive position in the international market would be harmed.

Many countries, including E.U. countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled under specified circumstances to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we may have limited remedies if patents are infringed or if we are compelled to grant a license to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of those patents. This could limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.

Patent terms may be inadequate to protect our competitive position on our product candidates for an adequate amount of time.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. In certain instances, the patent term may be adjusted to add additional days to compensate for delays incurred by the USPTO in issuing the patent. Also, the patent term may be extended for a period of time to compensate for at least a portion of the time a product candidate was undergoing FDA regulatory review. However, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired, we may be open to competition from competitive products, including generics or biosimilars. The patent family directed to the composition of matter of IMVT1401 has a natural projected expiration date in 2035 in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.

If we are not able to obtain patent term extension in the United States under the Hatch-Waxman Act and in foreign countries under similar legislation, thereby potentially extending the term of our marketing exclusivity for IMVT-1401 or other product candidates that we may identify, our business may be harmed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our commercial success will largely depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property rights in the United States and other countries with respect to our proprietary technology, product candidates and our target indications. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting our product candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates begin to be commercialized. Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA marketing approval of IMVT-1401 or other product candidates that we may identify, one of the U.S. patents covering each of such product candidates or the use thereof may be eligible for up to five years of patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act allows a maximum of one patent to be extended per FDA approved product as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA premarket regulatory review process. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and only claims covering such approved drug product, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. Patent term extension also may be available in certain foreign countries, including the E.U., upon regulatory approval of our product candidates, based on similar legislation. Nevertheless, we may not be granted patent term extension either in the United States or in any foreign country because of, for example, failing to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the term of extension, as well as the scope of patent protection during any such extension, afforded by the governmental authority could be less than we request.

If we are unable to obtain patent term extension, or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we will have the right to exclusively market our product may be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing products sooner, and our revenue could be reduced, possibly materially.

It is possible that we will not obtain patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act for a U.S. patent covering IMVT-1401 or other product candidates that we may identify even where that patent is eligible for patent term extension, or if we obtain such an extension, it may be for a shorter period than we had sought. Further, for patents we may later in-license or jointly own, we may not have the right to control patent prosecution, including filing with the USPTO a petition for patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. Thus, if one of these patents was eligible for patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act, we might not be able to control whether a petition to obtain a patent term extension would be filed, or obtained, from the USPTO.

We do not have rights to protect or enforce intellectual property rights in certain territories and jurisdictions.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We do not have rights to develop, manufacture, use or commercialize IMVT-1401 or file or enforce patents relating to these assets in territories other than the Licensed Territory, as such rights in other jurisdictions have been retained by HanAll or licensed by HanAll to third parties. One or more third parties may challenge the current patents, or patents that may issue in the future, in such territories for which HanAll retains rights or has licensed out rights to defend and enforce such patents. HanAll may not coordinate the defense and enforcement of such patents with us, which could impair our ability to defend or enforce corresponding patents in other jurisdictions.

Table of Contents
-----------------

If we fail to comply with our obligations under any license, collaboration or other agreements, including the HanAll Agreement, we may be required to pay damages and could lose intellectual property rights that are necessary for developing and protecting our product candidate.

We have licensed certain intellectual property rights, including certain intellectual property rights covering our product candidate, IMVT-1401, from HanAll. We are heavily dependent on the HanAll Agreement for the development, manufacture and commercialization of our product candidate, IMVT-1401. If, for any reason, our licenses under the HanAll Agreement are terminated or we otherwise lose those rights, it could adversely affect our business. The HanAll Agreement imposes, and any future collaboration agreements or license agreements we enter into are likely to impose various development, commercialization, funding, milestone payment, royalty, diligence, sublicensing, insurance, patent prosecution and enforcement or other obligations on us. If we breach any material obligations, or use the intellectual property licensed to us in an unauthorized manner, we may be required to pay damages and HanAll, as the licensor, may have the right to terminate the license, which could result in us being unable to develop, manufacture and sell products that are covered by the licensed technology, or having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses on less favorable terms, or enable a competitor to gain access to the licensed technology.

Moreover, disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including:

* · the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;
* · the extent to which our product candidates, technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;
* · the sublicensing of patent and other rights under our third-party relationships;
* · our diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;
* · the inventorship and ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners; and
* · the priority of invention of patented technology.

In addition, the agreement under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from HanAll is complex, and certain provisions in the agreement may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize such affected product candidate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.

Table of Contents
-----------------

Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for noncompliance with these requirements.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Periodic maintenance fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO and other foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign national or international patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process and fee payment during the life of a patent. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Noncompliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of patent rights include, but are not limited to, failure to timely file national and regional stage patent applications based on our international patent application, failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or our licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product candidates, our competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than anticipated, which would have an adverse effect on our business.

We may need to license intellectual property from third parties, and such licenses may not be available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights that are important or necessary to the development of any of our product candidates. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize IMVT-1401 or any future product candidates, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms. Such a license may not be available, or it may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. Our business would be harmed if we are not able to obtain such a license on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or if a non-exclusive license is offered and our competitors gain access to the same technology.

The risks described elsewhere pertaining to our intellectual property rights also apply to the intellectual property rights that we in-license, and any failure by us or our licensors to obtain, maintain, defend and enforce these rights could have an adverse effect on our business. In some cases we may not have control over the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of the patents that we license, and may not have sufficient ability to provide input into the patent prosecution, maintenance and defense process with respect to such patents, and our licensors may fail to take the steps that we believe are necessary or desirable in order to obtain, maintain, defend and enforce the licensed patents.

Third-party claims or litigation alleging infringement of patents or other proprietary rights, or seeking to invalidate patents or other proprietary rights, may delay or prevent the development and commercialization of our product candidates.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to operate while avoiding infringement and other violations of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. However, our research, development and commercialization activities may be subject to claims that we infringe or otherwise violate patents or other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, derivation and administrative law proceedings, inter partes review and post-grant review before the USPTO, as well as oppositions and similar processes in foreign jurisdictions. Our competitors in both the United States and abroad, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in patent portfolios and competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for or obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use and sell, if approved, any of our product candidates. Numerous United States and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we and our collaborators are developing product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, and as we gain greater visibility and market exposure as a public company, the risk increases that our product candidates or other business activities may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent and other proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties may assert that we are infringing their patents or employing their proprietary technology without authorization.

Table of Contents
-----------------

There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our product candidates. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications that may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may infringe. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of any of our product candidates, any molecules formed during the manufacturing process or any final product itself, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to commercialize such product candidate unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire. Similarly, if any third-party patent was to be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations, processes for manufacture or methods of use, including combination therapy, the holders of any such patent may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires. In either case, such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we may be subject to claims that we are infringing other intellectual property rights, such as trademarks or copyrights, or misappropriating the trade secrets of others, and to the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property or proprietary information owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.

Parties making claims against us may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to further develop and commercialize any of our product candidates. Defending these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful infringement or other intellectual property claim against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys' fees for willful infringement, obtain one or more licenses from third parties, pay royalties or redesign our affected products, which may be impossible or require substantial time and monetary expenditure. We cannot predict whether any such license would be available at all or whether it would be available on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, even in the absence of litigation, we may need to obtain licenses from third parties to advance our research or allow commercialization of a product candidate. We may fail to obtain any of these licenses at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms, if at all. In that event, we would be unable to further develop and commercialize a product candidate, which could harm our business significantly. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar negative impact on our business.

Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex intellectual property litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, intellectual property litigation, regardless of its outcome, may cause negative publicity, adversely impact prospective customers, cause product shipment delays, or prohibit us from manufacturing, importing, marketing or otherwise commercializing our product candidate or any future product candidates. Any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional funds or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition or cash flows.

Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, which could have a material adverse effect on the price of shares of our common stock. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of shares of our common stock. The occurrence of any of these events may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation, financial condition or cash flows.

We cannot provide any assurances that third-party patents do not exist which might be enforced against our product candidate or any future product candidates, resulting in either an injunction prohibiting our sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties or other forms of compensation to third parties.

-----------------

We may not identify relevant third-party patents or may incorrectly interpret the relevance, scope or expiration of a third-party patent, which might adversely affect our ability to develop and market our product candidate or any future product candidates.

We cannot guarantee that any of our or our licensors' patent searches or analyses, including the identification of relevant patents, the scope of patent claims or the expiration of relevant patents, are complete or thorough, nor can we be certain that we have identified each and every third-party patent and pending application in the United States and abroad that is or may be relevant to or necessary for the commercialization of our product candidate or any future product candidates in any jurisdiction. Patent applications in the United States and elsewhere are not published until approximately 18 months after the earliest filing for which priority is claimed, with such earliest filing date being commonly referred to as the priority date. In addition, U.S. patent applications filed before November 29, 2000 and certain U.S. patent applications filed after that date that will not be filed outside the United States remain confidential until patents issue. Therefore, patent applications covering our product candidate or any future product candidates could have been filed by others without our knowledge. Additionally, pending patent applications that have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our product candidate or any future product candidates, the use thereof, provided such pending patent applications result in issued patents, our ability to develop and market our product candidate or any future product candidates can be adversely affected in jurisdictions where such patents issue.

The scope of a patent claim is determined by an interpretation of the law, the written disclosure in a patent and the patent's prosecution history. Our interpretation of the relevance or the scope of a patent or a pending application may be incorrect, which may negatively impact our ability to market any of our product candidates, if approved. We may incorrectly determine that our product candidate is not covered by a third-party patent or may incorrectly predict whether a third-party's pending application will issue with claims of relevant scope. Our determination of the expiration date of any patent in the United States or abroad that we consider relevant may be incorrect, and our failure to identify and correctly interpret relevant patents may negatively impact our ability to develop and market our product candidate or any future product candidates, if approved.

If we fail to identify and correctly interpret relevant patents, we may be subject to infringement claims. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully settle or otherwise resolve such infringement claims. If we fail in any such dispute, in addition to being forced to pay damages, we may be temporarily or permanently prohibited from commercializing any of our products that are held to be infringing. We might, if possible, also be forced to redesign products so that we no longer infringe the third-party intellectual property rights. Any of these events, even if we were ultimately to prevail, could require us to divert substantial financial and management resources that we would otherwise be able to devote to our business.

We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, the patents of our licensors or our other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competitors may infringe or otherwise violate our patents, the patents of our licensors or our other intellectual property rights. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file legal claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours or our licensors is not valid or is unenforceable, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover the technology in question. The standards that courts use to interpret patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change, particularly as new technologies develop. As a result, we cannot predict with certainty how much protection, if any, will be given to our patents if we attempt to enforce them and they are challenged in court. Further, even if we prevail against an infringer in U.S. district court, there is always the risk that the infringer will file an appeal and the district court judgment will be overturned at the appeals court and/or that an adverse decision will be issued by the appeals court relating to the validity or enforceability of our patents. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly in a manner insufficient to achieve our business objectives, or could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing. The initiation of a claim against a third party may also cause the third party to bring counter claims against us such as claims asserting that our patents are invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, non-enablement or lack of written description or statutory subject matter. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant material information from the USPTO, or made a materially misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar validity claims before the USPTO in post-grant proceedings such as ex parte reexaminations, inter partes review, or post-grant review, or oppositions or similar proceedings outside the United States, in parallel with litigation or even outside the context of litigation. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. We cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. For patents and patent applications that we may in-license, we may have a limited right or no right to participate in the defense of any licensed patents against challenge by a third party. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of any future patent protection on IMVT-1401 or any future product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection could harm our business.

We may not be able to detect or prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Our business could be harmed if in litigation the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Any litigation or other proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights may fail, and even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees.

Even if we establish infringement, the court may decide not to grant an injunction against further infringing activity and instead award only monetary damages, which may or may not be an adequate remedy. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have an adverse effect on the price of shares of our common stock.

Because the patents we own are owned by our wholly owned subsidiary, ISG, we may not be in a position to obtain a permanent injunction against a third party that is found to infringe our patents.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any patents that we own are assigned to our wholly owned subsidiary, ISG. If a third party is found to be infringing such patents, we may not be able to permanently enjoin the third party from making, using, offering for sale or selling the infringing product or activity for the remaining life of such patent in the United States or foreign jurisdictions because the patent is assigned to our wholly owned subsidiary, ISG, which is not the entity that would be commercializing a potentially competitive product or service.

-----------------

Because of the expense and uncertainty of litigation, we may not be in a position to enforce our intellectual property rights against third parties.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because of the expense and uncertainty of litigation, we may conclude that even if a third party is infringing our issued patent, any patents that may be issued as a result of our pending or future patent applications or other intellectual property rights, the risk-adjusted cost of bringing and enforcing such a claim or action may be too high or not in the best interest of our company or our stockholders. In such cases, we may decide that the more prudent course of action is to simply monitor the situation or initiate or seek some other non-litigious action or solution.

Changes in United States patent law or the patent law of other countries or jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our product candidates.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents relating to our product candidate, IMVT-1401, and any future product candidates. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involves both technological and legal complexity and is therefore costly, time consuming and inherently uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States or USPTO rules and regulations could increase the uncertainties and costs.

In addition, the United States federal government retains certain rights in inventions produced with its financial assistance under the Bayh-Dole Act. The federal government retains a "nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license" for its own benefit. The Bayh-Dole Act also provides federal agencies with "march-in rights." March-in rights allow the government, in specified circumstances, to require the contractor or successors in title to the patent to grant a "nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license" to a "responsible applicant or applicants." If the patent owner refuses to do so, the government may grant the license itself.

The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. courts, the USPTO and the relevant law-making bodies in other countries, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.

Similarly, changes in patent law and regulations in other countries or jurisdictions or changes in the governmental bodies that enforce them or changes in how the relevant governmental authority enforces patent laws or regulations may weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce patents that we have licensed or that we may obtain in the future. We cannot predict future changes in the interpretation of patent laws or changes to patent laws that might be enacted into law by United States and foreign legislative bodies. Those changes may materially affect our patents or patent applications and our ability to obtain additional patent protection in the future.

If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets and other proprietary information, including as a result of our reliance on third parties, our business and competitive position could be harmed.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to seeking patents for our product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary technology in part by entering into confidentiality agreements and, if applicable, material transfer agreements, consulting agreements or other similar agreements with our advisors, employees, third-party contractors and consultants prior to beginning research or disclosing proprietary information. Despite these efforts and the contractual provisions employed when working with third parties, the need to share trade secrets and other confidential information due to our reliance on third parties, increases the risk that such trade secrets become known by our competitors, are inadvertently incorporated into the technology of others, or are disclosed or used in violation of these agreements. Any disclosure, either intentional or unintentional, by our employees, the employees of third parties with whom we share our facilities or third-party consultants and vendors that we engage to perform research, clinical trials or manufacturing activities, or misappropriation by third parties (such as through a cybersecurity breach) of our trade secrets or proprietary information could enable competitors to duplicate or surpass our technological achievements, thus eroding our competitive position in our market.

Table of Contents
-----------------

Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures of our intellectual property is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be effective. In addition, we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for any such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. Further, our key employees, consultants, suppliers or other individuals with access to our proprietary technology and know-how may incorporate that technology and know-how into projects and inventions developed independently or with third parties. As a result, disputes may arise regarding the ownership of the proprietary rights to such technology or know-how, and any such dispute may not be resolved in our favor. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets or other proprietary information were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position could be harmed.

We may be subject to claims that our licensors, employees, consultants, independent contractors or we have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of their former employers or other third parties.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We do and may employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our licensors, competitors or potential competitors. Although we seek to protect our ownership of intellectual property rights by ensuring that our agreements with our employees, consultants, collaborators, independent contractors and other third parties with whom we do business include provisions requiring such parties to assign rights in inventions to us and to not use the know-how or confidential information of their former employer or other third parties, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants, collaborators or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed know-how or confidential information of their former employers or other third parties. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. There is no guarantee of success in defending these claims, and if we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, which could result in customers seeking other sources for the technology, or in ceasing from doing business with us. Such intellectual property rights could be awarded to a third party, and we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to commercialize our technology or a product candidate. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we are successful, litigation could result in substantial cost and be a distraction to our management and other employees. Moreover, any such litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our reputation, our ability to form strategic alliances or sublicense our rights to collaborators, engage with scientific advisors or hire employees or consultants, each of which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other intellectual property.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We or our licensors may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our owned or in-licensed patents, trade secrets, or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. For example, we or our licensors may have inventorship disputes arise from conflicting obligations of employees, consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidate. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or our licensors' ownership of our owned or in-licensed patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property.

In addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. Our and their assignment agreements may not be self-executing or may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property.

If we or our licensors fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable personnel or intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, intellectual property that is important to any of our product candidates. Even if we and our licensors are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Table of Contents
-----------------

Intellectual property litigation could cause us to spend substantial resources and distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities and have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have an adverse effect on the price of shares of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing or distribution activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. In addition, the uncertainties associated with litigation could compromise our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials and internal research programs, or in-license needed technology or other product candidates. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could compromise our ability to compete in the marketplace, including compromising our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our clinical trials, continue our research programs, license necessary technology from third parties, or enter into development collaborations that would help us commercialize our product candidate or any future product candidates, if approved.

Any trademarks and trade names we have obtained or may obtain may be infringed or successfully challenged, resulting in harm to our business.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We expect to rely on trademarks and trade names as one means to distinguish any of our drug candidates that are approved for marketing from the products of our competitors. Once we select new trademarks and apply to register them, our trademark applications may not be approved. We may not be able to protect our rights in these trademarks and trade names, which we need in order to build name recognition with potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. In addition, third parties may have used trademarks similar and identical to our trademarks in certain jurisdictions and may have filed or may in the future file for registration of such trademarks. Third parties may oppose or attempt to cancel our trademark applications or trademarks, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we may not be able to use these trademarks to market our products in those countries and could be forced to rebrand our drugs, which could result in loss of brand recognition and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Our competitors may infringe our trademarks and we may not have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks. If we attempt to enforce our trademarks and assert trademark infringement claims, a court may determine that the marks we have asserted are invalid or unenforceable, or that the party against whom we have asserted trademark infringement has superior rights to the marks in question. In this case, we could ultimately be forced to cease use of such trademarks. In any case, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively and our business may be adversely affected.

Our intellectual property agreements with third parties may be subject to disagreements over contract interpretation, which could narrow the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Certain provisions in our intellectual property agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could affect the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property, or affect financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

-----------------

We may not be successful in obtaining necessary intellectual property rights to future products through acquisitions and in-licenses.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We may seek to acquire or in-license additional product candidates or technologies to grow our product offerings and intellectual property portfolio. However, we may be unable to acquire or in-license intellectual property rights relating to, or necessary for, any such product candidates from third parties on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In that event, we may be unable to develop or commercialize such product candidates or technology. We may also be unable to identify product candidates or technology that we believe are an appropriate strategic fit for our company and protect intellectual property relating to, or necessary for, such product candidates and technology.

The in-licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights for product candidates is a competitive area, and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to in-license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights for products that we may consider attractive or necessary. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. Furthermore, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. If we are unable to successfully obtain rights to additional technologies or products, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects for growth could suffer.

In addition, we expect that competition for the in-licensing or acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights for product candidates and technologies that are attractive to us may increase in the future, which may mean fewer suitable opportunities for us as well as higher acquisition or licensing costs. We may be unable to inlicense or acquire the third-party intellectual property rights for product candidates or technology on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment.

Intellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once granted, patents may remain open to invalidity challenges including opposition, interference, re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, nullification or derivation action in court or before patent offices or similar proceedings for a given period after allowance or grant, during which time third parties can raise objections against such granted patent. In the course of such proceedings, which may continue for a protracted period of time, the patent owner may be compelled to limit the scope of the allowed or granted claims thus challenged, or may lose the allowed or granted claims altogether.

In addition, the degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights afford only limited protection, and may not adequately protect our business, provide a barrier to entry against our competitors or potential competitors, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. Moreover, if a third party has intellectual property rights that cover the practice of our technology, we may not be able to fully exercise or extract value from our intellectual property rights. The following examples are illustrative:

* · others may be able to make formulations or compositions that are the same as or similar to our product candidate, but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own;
* · others may be able to make a product that is similar to our product candidate and not covered by the patents that we exclusively licensed and have the right to enforce;
* · we, our licensor or any collaborators might not have been the first to make or reduce to practice the inventions covered by the issued patents or pending patent applications that we own or have exclusively licensed;
* · we or our licensor or any collaborators might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our or our licensor's inventions;
* · others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;
* · it is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;
* · patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantages, or may be held invalid or unenforceable as a result of legal challenges;

Table of Contents
-----------------

* · our competitors might conduct research and development activities in the United States and other countries that provide a safe harbor from patent infringement claims for certain research and development activities, as well as in countries where we do not have patent rights, and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;
* · we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;
* · third parties performing manufacturing or testing for us using our product candidate or technologies could use the intellectual property of others without obtaining a proper license;
* · parties may assert an ownership interest in our intellectual property and, if successful, such disputes may preclude us from exercising exclusive rights over that intellectual property;
* · we may not develop or in-license additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;
* · we may not be able to obtain and maintain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all; and
* · the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.

Should any of these events occur, they could harm our business and results of operations.

General Risks Related to an Investment in Our Securities
--------------------------------------------------------

RSL owns a significant percentage of shares of our common stock and may exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of May 28, 2021, RSL beneficially owned approximately 57.5% of the voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock. Therefore, we are controlled by RSL and RSL has the ability to substantially influence us and exert significant control through this ownership position. It is possible RSL may be able to control elections of directors, the issuance of equity, including to our employees under equity incentive plans, amendments of our organizational documents, or approval of any merger, amalgamation, sale of assets or other major corporate transaction. For example, in March 2021, RSL announced its intent to propose a potential transaction with us pursuant to which RSL or its affiliate would acquire all of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock not currently held by RSL. Our board of directors has formed a special committee that consists of independent directors to evaluate and negotiate any such proposal, if received, and has engaged Centerview Partners as its financial advisor, and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz as its legal advisor. While no assurances can be given that RSL will make such proposal or that any transaction with us will be consummated, RSL continues to exercise significant control over our decisions and may, in the future, engage in similar discussions with us. RSL's interests may not always coincide with our corporate interests or the interests of other stockholders, and it may exercise its voting and other rights in a manner with which you may not agree or that may not be in the best interests of our other stockholders. Further, RSL is a privately held company whose ownership and governance structure is not transparent to our other stockholders. RSL recently entered into a business combination agreement with Montes Archimedes Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition corporation, pursuant to which RSL would become a publicly-traded corporation if such transaction is completed. There may be changes to the management or ownership of RSL, or to RSL's business model, that could impact RSL's interests in a way that may not coincide with our corporate interests or the interests of other stockholders. Any such changes may diminish, or eliminate entirely, any benefits we expect to derive from our membership in the Roivant family of companies. So long as RSL continues to own a significant amount of our equity, it will continue to be able to strongly influence and effectively control our decisions.

RSL has the right to elect a certain number of directors to our board of directors.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RSL has the right to elect a certain number of Series A Preferred Directors to our board of directors, in accordance with our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. While the directors appointed by RSL are obligated to act in accordance with their applicable fiduciary duties, they may have equity or other interests in RSL and, accordingly, their interests may be aligned with RSL's interests, which may not always coincide with our corporate interests or the interests of our other stockholders. Until such time as Roivant holds less than 50% of the voting power of our outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote generally at an election of directors, the directors appointed by Roivant will be able to determine the outcome of all matters presented to the board of directors.

Table of Contents
-----------------

Our organizational and ownership structure may create significant conflicts of interests.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our organizational and ownership structure involves a number of relationships that may give rise to certain conflicts of interest between us and minority holders of shares of our common stock, on the one hand, and RSL, on the other hand. Certain of our directors and employees have equity interests in RSL and, accordingly, their interests may be aligned with RSL's interests, which may not always coincide with our corporate interests or the interests of our other stockholders. Further, our other stockholders may not have visibility into the RSL ownership of any of our directors or officers, which may change at any time through acquisition, disposition, dilution, or otherwise. Any change in our directors' or officers' RSL ownership could impact the interests of those holders.

In addition, we are party to certain related party agreements with RSL, RSI and RSG. These entities and their stockholders, including certain of our directors and employees, may have interests which differ from our interests or those of the minority holders of shares of our common stock. Any material transaction between us and RSL, RSI, RSG or any other affiliate of RSL is subject to our related party transaction policy, which requires prior approval of such transaction by our audit committee. To the extent we fail to appropriately deal with any such conflicts of interests, it could negatively impact our reputation and ability to raise additional funds and the willingness of counterparties to do business with us, all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

The market price of shares of our common stock has been and is likely to be highly volatile, and you may lose some or all of your investment.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The market price of shares of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors, including the following:

* · results of clinical trials for IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate or those of our competitors;
* · any delay in the commencement, enrollment and ultimate completion of our clinical trials;
* · any delay in filing a BLA or similar application for IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate and any adverse development or perceived adverse development with respect to the FDA or other regulatory authority's review of that BLA or similar application, as the case may be;
* · failure to successfully develop and commercialize IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate;
* · inability to obtain additional funding;
* · regulatory or legal developments in the United States or other countries or jurisdictions applicable to IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate;
* · adverse regulatory decisions;
* · changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;
* · inability to obtain adequate product supply for IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate, or the inability to do so at acceptable prices;
* · introduction of new products, services or technologies by our competitors;
* · failure to meet or exceed financial projections we provide to the public;
* · failure to meet or exceed the estimates and projections of the investment community;
* · changes in the market valuations of similar companies;
* · market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors and the issuance of new or changed securities analysts' reports or recommendations;
* · announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us or our competitors;
* · variations in our financial results or the financial results of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;

Table of Contents
-----------------

* · changes in estimates of financial results or investment recommendations by securities analysts;
* · significant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation and disputes or other developments relating to our proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;
* · additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;
* · short sales of shares of our common stock;
* · sales of a substantial number of shares of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares;
* · sales or purchases of shares of our common stock by our directors or Section 16 officers;
* · sales of shares of our common stock by us or sales or purchases of our common stock by our stockholders in the future, including RSL;
* · negative coverage in the media or analyst reports, whether accurate or not;
* · issuance of subpoenas or investigative demands, or the public fact of an investigation by a government agency, whether meritorious or not;
* · the size of our public float;
* · trading liquidity of shares of our common stock;
* · investors' general perception of our company and our business;
* · general economic, industry and market conditions; and
* · the other factors described in this "Risk Factors" section.

In addition, in the past, when the market price of a stock has been volatile, holders of that stock have sometimes instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock. For example, we currently have one such putative class-action complaint brought against us. We could incur substantial costs defending this or similar lawsuits, as well as diversion of the time and attention of our management, any or all of which could seriously harm our business. Furthermore, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies, including very recently in connection with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in decreased stock prices for many companies notwithstanding the lack of a fundamental change in their underlying business models or prospects. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors, including potentially worsening economic conditions and other adverse effects or developments relating to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, political, regulatory and other market conditions, may negatively affect the market price of shares of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The market price of shares of our common stock may decline, and you may lose some or all of your investment.

We are subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention and adversely impact our business.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. Companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their common stock are often subject to securities class action litigation. For example, in February 2021, a securities class action complaint was filed against us, certain of our officers and a board member of HSAC. The case is still pending. This or any future securities litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management's attention and resources, which could adversely impact our business. Any adverse determination in litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities. See Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings for more information.

-----------------

We are a "controlled company" within the meaning of the applicable Nasdaq listing rules and, as a result, qualify for exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements. If we rely on these exemptions, you will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to such requirements.

RSL controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding shares of common stock. As a result, we are a "controlled company" within the meaning of applicable Nasdaq listing rules. Under these rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, group or another company is a "controlled company." In addition, for so long as the RSL designated directors control all matters presented to our board of directors for a vote, we will be a "controlled company." For so long as we remain a "controlled company," we may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements, including the requirements:

* · that a majority of the board of directors consists of independent directors;
* · for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees;
* · that we have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities; and
* · that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibility.

We intend to use all or some of these exemptions. As a result, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the Nasdaq corporate governance requirements.

If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The trading market for shares of our common stock will depend, in part, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts. If our financial performance fails to meet analyst estimates or one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade shares of our common stock or change their opinion of shares of our common stock, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.

Because we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, would be your sole source of gain.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on shares of our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of shares of our common stock would be your sole source of gain on an investment in shares of our common stock for the foreseeable future.

We will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will continue to devote substantial time to compliance with our public company responsibilities and corporate governance practices.

As a public company, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses, particularly since we are now a large accelerated filer and are no longer a smaller reporting company after March 31, 2021. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the listing requirements of The Nasdaq Global Select Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations impose various requirements on public companies. Our management and other personnel will need to continue to devote a substantial amount of time to comply with these requirements. Moreover, these rules and regulations have increased, and will continue to increase, our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more timeconsuming and costly. If, notwithstanding our efforts to comply with new or changing laws, regulations and standards, we fail to comply, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us, and our business may be harmed. Further, failure to comply with these laws, regulations and standards may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain directors' and officers' liability insurance, which could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members to serve on our board of directors or committees or as members of senior management. These rules and regulations are often subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in future uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.

As a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting and any failure to maintain the adequacy of these internal controls may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of shares of our common stock.

Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, or Section 404, we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting, including an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm. To maintain compliance with Section 404, we engage in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting, which is both costly and challenging. In this regard, we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources, engage outside consultants and refine and revise a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting, continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate, validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting. Despite our efforts, there is a risk that neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404.

If we are unable to conclude that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal controls over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of shares of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain other effective control systems required of public companies, could also negatively impact our ability to access to the capital markets.

In addition, effective disclosure controls and procedures enable us to make timely and accurate disclosure of financial and non-financial information that we are required to disclose. As a public company, if our disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective, we may be unable to report our financial results or make other disclosures accurately on a timely basis, which could cause our reported financial results or other disclosures to be materially misstated and result in the loss of investor confidence and cause the market price of shares of our common stock to decline.

We may become subject to unanticipated tax liabilities and higher effective tax rates.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our wholly owned subsidiary, ISL, is incorporated under the laws of Bermuda, where it is not subject to any income or withholding taxes. Further, ISL is centrally managed and controlled in the U. K., and, under current U. K. tax law, a company which is centrally managed and controlled in the U.K. is regarded as resident in the U. K. for taxation purposes. Accordingly, we expect ISL to be subject to U.K. taxation on its income and gains and subject to the U.K.'s controlled foreign company rules, except where an exemption applies. ISL may be treated as a dual resident company for U.K. tax purposes. As a result, ISL's right to claim certain reliefs from U.K. tax may be restricted, and changes in law or practice in the U.K. could result in the imposition of further restrictions on ISL's right to claim U.K. tax reliefs. ISL may also become subject to income, withholding or other taxes in certain jurisdictions by reason of its activities and operations, and it is also possible that taxing authorities in any such jurisdictions could assert that ISL is subject to greater taxation than we currently anticipate. Any such additional tax liability could adversely affect our results of operations.

The intended tax effects of our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements depend on the application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions and on how we operate our business.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our wholly owned subsidiary, ISL, and our controlling stockholder, RSL, are incorporated under the laws of Bermuda and are tax residents of the U.K. Further, we currently have other subsidiaries that are domiciled in the U. K., Switzerland and the United States. If we succeed in growing our business, we expect to conduct increased operations through our subsidiaries in various countries and tax jurisdictions, in part through intercompany service agreements between us, our parent company and our subsidiaries. In that case, our corporate structure and intercompany transactions, including the manner in which we develop and use our intellectual property, will be organized so that we can achieve our business objectives in a tax-efficient manner and in compliance with applicable transfer pricing rules and regulations. If two or more affiliated companies are located in different countries or tax jurisdictions, the tax laws and regulations of each country generally will require that transfer prices be the same as those between unrelated companies dealing at arms' length and that appropriate documentation be maintained to support the transfer prices. While we believe that we operate in compliance with applicable transfer pricing laws and intend to continue to do so, our transfer pricing procedures are not binding on applicable tax authorities. If tax authorities in any of these countries were to successfully challenge our transfer prices as not reflecting arms' length transactions, they could require us to adjust our transfer prices and thereby reallocate our income to reflect these revised transfer prices, which could result in a higher tax liability to us. In addition, if the country from which the income is reallocated does not agree with the reallocation, both countries could tax the same income, potentially resulting in double taxation. If tax authorities were to allocate income to a higher tax jurisdiction, subject our income to double taxation or assess interest and penalties, it would increase our consolidated tax liability, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates or by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations. As we intend to operate in numerous countries and taxing jurisdictions, the application of tax laws can be subject to diverging and sometimes conflicting interpretations by tax authorities of these jurisdictions. It is not uncommon for taxing authorities in different countries to have conflicting views, for instance, with respect to, among other things, the manner in which the arm's length standard is applied for transfer pricing purposes, or with respect to the valuation of intellectual property. In addition, tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. Moreover, certain relevant tax, accounting and other laws have special application with respect to "affiliated," "combined" or similar groups, which may include RSL, ISL and their respective subsidiaries, and which may impact the tax liabilities of the companies. We continue to assess the impact of such changes in tax laws on our business and may determine that changes to our structure, practice or tax positions are necessary in light of such changes and developments in the tax laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate. Such changes may nevertheless be ineffective in avoiding an increase in our consolidated tax liability, which could harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income in future periods.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our tax position could be adversely impacted by changes in tax rates, tax laws, tax practice, tax treaties or tax regulations or changes in the interpretation thereof by the tax authorities in Europe (including the U.K. and Switzerland), the United States, Bermuda and other jurisdictions as well as being affected by certain changes currently proposed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and their action plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting. Such changes may become more likely as a result of recent economic trends in the jurisdictions in which we operate, particularly if such trends continue. If such a situation was to arise, it could adversely impact our tax position and our effective tax rate. Failure to manage the risks associated with such changes, or misinterpretation of the laws providing such changes, could result in costly audits, interest, penalties and reputational damage, which could adversely affect our business, results of our operations and our financial condition.

Our actual effective tax rate may vary from our expectation and that variance may be material. A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates, including: (1) the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed; (2) the resolution of issues arising from any future tax audits with various tax authorities; (3) changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; (4) increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including transaction costs and impairments of goodwill in connection with acquisitions; (5) changes in the taxation of stock-based compensation; (6) changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws, and changes in generally accepted accounting principles; and (7) challenges to the transfer pricing policies related to our structure.

Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.

Provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that:

* · authorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, shares of undesignated preferred stock with terms, rights, and preferences determined by our board of directors that may be senior to our common stock;
* · specify that the holder of our Series A preferred stock, RSL, has the right to appoint a certain number of Series A Preferred Directors to our board of directors;
* · require that, from and after such time as we are no longer a "controlled company" within the meaning of Nasdaq rules, any action to be taken by our holders of common stock be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;
* · specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by the chairperson of our board of directors, our chief executive officer or our board of directors;
* · establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;
* · provide that, subject to the rights of our Series A preferred stockholder, our directors may be removed only upon the vote of at least 66 2/3% of our outstanding shares of voting stock;
* · require the approval of our board of directors or, from and after such time as we are no longer a "controlled company" within the meaning of Nasdaq rules, the holders of at least 66 2/3% of our outstanding shares of voting stock to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation;
* · provide that the number of directors is set at seven and may only be changed by resolution of the board of directors, including a majority of Series A Preferred Directors then serving;
* · prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors; and
* · provide that, subject to the rights of our Series A preferred stockholder, vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum.

-----------------

These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. Any of the foregoing provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, and they could deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you would receive a premium for your shares of our common stock in an acquisition.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America as the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which will restrict our stockholders' ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under Delaware statutory or common law: any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; any action asserting a breach of a fiduciary duty; any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws; any action as to which Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; and any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act actions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having to litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different courts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.

These choice of forum provisions may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of forum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than those designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the validity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This may require significant additional costs, and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other jurisdictions. If a court were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could seriously harm our business.

Our fiscal year ends on March 31.

Prior to December 18, 2019, we were known as Health Sciences Acquisitions Corporation. On December 18, 2019, we completed the Business Combination with Immunovant Sciences Ltd., a private company. For accounting purposes, Health Sciences Acquisitions Corporation was deemed to be the acquired entity.

Overview
--------

We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on enabling normal lives for people with autoimmune diseases. We are developing a novel, fully human monoclonal antibody, IMVT-1401 (formerly referred to as RVT-1401), that selectively binds to and inhibits the neonatal fragment crystallizable receptor ("FcRn"). IMVT-1401 is the product of a multi-step, multi-year research program conducted by HanAll Biopharma Co., Ltd., to design a highly potent anti-FcRn antibody optimized for subcutaneous delivery. Our product candidate has been dosed in small volumes (e.g., 2 mL) and with a 27-gauge needle, while still generating therapeutically relevant pharmacodynamic activity, important attributes that we believe will drive patient preference and market adoption. In nonclinical studies and in clinical trials conducted to date, IMVT-1401 has been observed to reduce immunoglobulin G ("IgG") antibody levels. High levels of pathogenic IgG antibodies drive a variety of autoimmune diseases and, as a result, we believe IMVT-1401 has the potential for broad application in these disease areas. We intend to develop IMVT-1401 in autoimmune diseases for which there is robust evidence that pathogenic IgG antibodies drive disease manifestation and for which reduction of IgG antibodies should lead to clinical benefit.

We are developing IMVT-1401 as a fixed-dose, self-administered subcutaneous injection on a convenient weekly, or less frequent, dosing schedule as discussed below. As a result of our rational design, we believe that IMVT-1401, if developed and approved for commercial sale, would be differentiated from currently available, more invasive treatments for advanced IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases, (e.g., MG, WAIHA and TED, Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura, Pemphigus Vulgaris, Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy, Bullous Pemphigoid, Neuromyelitis Optica, Pemphigus Foliaceus, Guillain-Barré Syndrome and PLA2R+ Membranous Nephropathy). In 2020, these diseases had an aggregate prevalence of approximately 278,000 patients in the United States and 480,000 patients in Europe. To the extent we choose to develop IMVT-1401 for certain of these rare diseases, we plan to seek orphan drug designation in the United States and Europe, where applicable. Such designations would primarily provide financial and exclusivity incentives intended to make the development of orphan drugs financially viable. However, we have not yet obtained such designation for any of our target indications, and there is no certainty that we will obtain such designation, or maintain the benefits associated with such designation if we do obtain it.

We are developing IMVT-1401 as a fixed-dose subcutaneous injection, and have focused our initial development efforts on the treatment of MG, WAIHA and TED. We are also pursuing a series of other indications. MG is an autoimmune disease associated with muscle weakness. In August 2020, we reported top-line results from an interim analysis of 15 participants in our ASCEND MG trial, a multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2a clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of IMVT-1401 in patients with moderate-to-severe MG. After the interim analysis, two additional participants enrolled and were randomized. The trial is now completed. See " Current Status of our Clinical Trials " below for further discussion.

WAIHA is a rare hematologic disease in which autoantibodies mediate hemolysis, or the destruction of red blood cells. In August 2020, we initiated dosing for ASCEND WAIHA, our Phase 2, open-label, sequential, two cohort clinical trial in patients with WAIHA. In February 2021, we voluntarily paused dosing in our clinical trials for IMVT-1401. Because the ASCEND WAIHA trial is an open label trial, the pause did not necessitate study termination but rather a suspension. See " Recent Developments in Our Clinical Programs " below for further discussion.

Table of Contents
-----------------

TED is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder that affects the muscles and other tissues around the eyes, which can be sight-threatening. In March 2020, we announced initial results from our ASCEND GO-1 trial, a Phase 2a open-label single-arm clinical trial in Canada in seven patients with TED. This trial is now completed. In October 2019, we initiated dosing in our ASCEND GO-2 trial, a randomized, masked, placebo-controlled Phase 2b clinical trial in patients with moderate-to-severe active TED with confirmed autoantibodies to thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor ("TSHR"). In February 2021, we voluntarily paused dosing in our clinical trials for IMVT-1401. Because the pause led to unblinding ASCEND GO-2, this trial was terminated after the last patient completed the withdrawal visit and the follow-up visit. See " Recent Developments in Our Clinical Programs " below for further discussion.

We were incorporated in July 2018 and we have been primarily engaged in preparing for and conducting clinical trials for our product candidate, IMVT-1401. To date, we have not generated any revenue and have generated significant operating losses since our inception. As of March 31, 2021 and 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $198.7 million and $91.2 million, respectively. For the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded net losses of $107.4 million and $66.4 million, respectively.

Recent Developments in Our Clinical Programs
--------------------------------------------

In February 2021, we voluntarily paused dosing in our clinical trials for IMVT-1401 due to elevated total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein ("LDL") levels observed in some trial subjects treated with IMVT-1401. We have informed regulatory authorities and trial subjects and investigators of this voluntary pause of dosing in our studies that were ongoing at that time, ASCEND GO-2, our Phase 2b trial in Thyroid Eye Disease and ASCEND WAIHA, our Phase 2 trial in Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia.

In order to better characterize the observed lipid findings, we conducted from February 2021 through May 2021 a program-wide data review (including both clinical and nonclinical data) with input from external scientific and medical experts.

In our ASCEND GO-2 trial, lipid parameters were assessed at baseline, at week 12, and at week 20 following eight weeks off drug. Based on preliminary, unblinded data, median LDL cholesterol at week 12 was increased by approximately 12 mg/dL in the 255 mg dose group (corresponding to an increase from baseline of approximately 15%), by approximately 33 mg/dL in the 340 mg dose group (corresponding to an increase from baseline of approximately 37%), by approximately 62 mg/dL in the 680 mg dose group (corresponding to an increase from baseline of approximately 52%) and did not increase in the control group. The data analysis indicates a dose-dependent increase in lipids. Average high-density lipoprotein ("HDL") and triglyceride levels also increased but to a much lesser degree. We also observed correlated decreases in albumin levels and the rate and extent of albumin reductions were dose-dependent. Subjects receiving the 255 mg weekly dose ("QW") experienced the smallest reductions in albumin through week 12, with a median reduction of about 16% from baseline, while subjects receiving the 340 mg or 680 mg QW dose experienced median reductions of albumin of 26% or 40%, respectively. At week 20, both lipids and albumin returned to baseline.

In our open label ASCEND WAIHA trial, only two subjects completed 12 weeks of dosing prior to the program-wide pause in dosing, with three additional subjects partially completing the dosing period. Pre-specified and post-hoc lipid test results from these five subjects were analyzed along with post-hoc lipid test results performed on frozen samples from ASCEND MG subjects (where available) and post-hoc lipid test results from our Phase 1 Injection Site study. LDL elevations observed in the ASCEND WAIHA and ASCEND MG subject populations and in healthy subjects in the Phase 1 Injection Site Study also appeared to be dose-dependent and were generally consistent in magnitude with the elevations observed in ASCEND GO-2 subjects.

No major adverse cardiovascular events have been reported to date in IMVT-1401 clinical trials.

Integrated Safety Assessment and Regulatory Interactions
--------------------------------------------------------

It is our intent to resume development across multiple indications for IMVT-1401. We are in the process of drafting multiple study protocols and updating our programwide safety strategy for discussions with regulatory agencies. The elements of our development program will include extensive pharmacokinetic ("PK") and pharmacodynamic ("PD") modeling to select dosing regimens for IMVT-1401 which optimize reductions in total IgG levels while minimizing the impact on albumin and LDL levels, particularly for clinical studies containing long-term treatment extensions. These protocols will likely include protocol-directed guidelines for the management of any observed lipid abnormalities. While increases in LDL over an 8 to 12 week treatment duration would not be expected to pose a safety concern for patients, the risk-benefit profile of long-term administration of IMVT-1401 will need to incorporate any unfavorable effects on lipid profiles. Discussions with regulatory agencies, including the FDA, are expected to commence during the second half of the calendar year 2021.

-----------------

Current Status of Our Clinical Trials
-------------------------------------

Before the voluntary pause of dosing, we had a favorable end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA on the design of our Phase 3 registrational program in MG and we were planning on advancing our clinical trials for this indication. Based on our integrated safety analysis, we plan to meet with the FDA to propose further development to evaluate additional dosing levels and regimens as well as to include additional safety monitoring and considerations such as lipid and albumin monitoring and incorporating an independent safety monitoring committee. Contingent upon FDA feedback, we plan to initiate a pivotal study in MG late in the calendar year 2021 or early part of the calendar year 2022.

Our ASCEND WAIHA trial is an open label trial and we are planning on advancing our clinical trials for this indication. During the fall of 2021, we plan to commence discussions with the FDA on re-initiating this study, incorporating additional safety considerations and risk management as well as additional dosing regimens. We anticipate re-initiating this study based on a favorable outcome from these meetings late in the calendar year 2021 or early part of the calendar year 2022.

Our voluntary pause in dosing led to unblinding of the ASCEND GO-2 trial and this trial was terminated after the last patient completed the withdrawal visit and the follow-up visit. Treatment with IMVT-1401 reduced both IgG and disease specific pathogenic IgG over the 12-week treatment period. However, the efficacy results, based on approximately half the anticipated number of subjects who had reached the week 13 primary efficacy analysis at the time of the termination of the trial, were inconclusive. The primary endpoint of the proportion of proptosis responders was not met, and although not tested statistically, post hoc evaluation of other endpoints measured (CAS and diplopia scores) indicated the desired magnitude of treatment effect likely would not have been achieved. However, levels of IgG were reduced across IMVT-1401 dosing groups, and analysis of the receptor occupancy data suggest binding of IMVT-1401 to the Fc receptor. Additional exploratory work on other disease biomarkers is under evaluation. Further discussions with external experts are ongoing to determine whether a specific population can be identified to optimize the clinical performance of IMVT-1401. Based on these analyses, we are likely to design another Phase 2 trial in TED or another thyroid-related disease as our next study in this therapeutic area and initiate discussions with regulatory authorities before the end of the calendar year 2021.

Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Pharmacodynamics (PD)
-----------------------------------------------

The PK and PD (including serum concentrations of total IgG, albumin, and lipids) of IMVT-1401 were evaluated in healthy subjects in our Phase 1 clinical trial and Phase 1 Injection Site Study, and in patients with MG, TED and WAIHA in our ASCEND MG, ASCEND GO-1, ASCEND GO-2 and ASCEND WAIHA trials. Over the course of development, we have made significant progress in understanding the PK profiles, PD responses, and PK/PD relationships for IMVT-1401. In addition, we have established preliminary population PK and population PK/PD models using pooled data from all clinical studies to better understand and predict the PK and PD properties associated with various treatment regimens across different populations.

To date, single doses of IMVT-1401 ranged from 100 mg to 1530 mg IV and 1.5 mg/kg to 765 mg and were administered by subcutaneous injections ("SC") to healthy subjects. Multiple doses of 255 mg, 340 mg, and 680 mg SC QW have been studied in healthy subjects (up to 4 weeks of dosing) and patients with TED, MG, or WAIHA (up to 12 weeks of dosing). Based on preliminary data from our ASCEND GO-2 trial in TED, drug concentrations achieved after 680 mg SC QW resided predominantly in the linear elimination phase of the PK profile and were estimated to maintain target saturation during the dosing intervals in most subjects. The mean maximal reduction of total IgG achieved with maximal target engagement was approximately 80% and was achieved after 7 weeks of dosing. Drug concentrations achieved with 255 mg or 340 mg SC QW did not maintain target saturation throughout the dosing intervals in the majority of subjects; total IgG levels continued to decrease and were reduced by median Emax of approximately 62% and 69%, respectively, at the end of the 12-week dosing period. The shoulder region of the doseresponse curve for reduction in total IgG was covered and observed. Within the dose range studied, the rate and extent of albumin reductions and lipid elevations were dose-dependent across different populations. Over a 12-week dosing period, median Emax of albumin reductions were approximately 16%, 26%, 40% and median increases in LDL were approximately 15%, 37% and 52% for the 255 mg, 340 mg and 680 mg SC QW doses, respectively. The lipid elevations were highly correlated with albumin reductions. Unlike the PK/PD relationship for total IgG, the shoulder region of the dose-response curves for reduction in albumin and increases in LDL were not clearly observed. Total IgG, albumin, and lipids levels returned to baseline within eight weeks after the last dose of a 12-week treatment.

Comprehensive understanding of the PK and PD characteristics of IMVT-1401 has enabled creation of robust mathematical models to support the selection of future dosing regimens. The discordance between the PK/PD response relationship for IgG and that of albumin or LDL suggests options for dosing regimens that provide potentially effective reductions in total IgG (and pathologic autoantibodies) while minimizing effects on albumin and LDL levels. Optimized dosing regimens, if shown to be effective, could improve the risk/benefit profile of IMVT-1401 while the ease of administration of our current formulation could enhance the overall patient experience.

Potential New Indications
-------------------------

We continue to evaluate potential new indications for IMVT-1401 by considering a number of factors including, but not limited to, degree of unmet need, degree of potential benefit offered by the treatment, safety-related parameters, target patient population size, likely duration of dosing and commercial potential.

We have identified many attractive first-in-class indications with high unmet need and scientific rationale for anti-FcRn therapy. In our studies to date, we learned that IMVT-1401 has the potential to be more effective than we expected at providing therapeutic relief for patients across a broad range of indications. We also believe that certain indications with existing anti-FcRn programs also offer a significant opportunity to provide unique patient benefit and therefore a strong commercial opportunity. Accordingly, we plan to announce two new indications and submit INDs and our trial designs to the FDA over the next 12 months. For competitive reasons, we will likely announce these indications only after we have agreement with the FDA that we may proceed with a planned protocol. We believe that one or two of these new indications will involve a new phase 2 program whereas one of our new indications can begin with a pivotal study in 2022.

COVID-19 Business Update
------------------------

We have been actively monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees and our business. Based on guidance issued by federal, state and local authorities, we transitioned to a remote work model for our employees in mid-March 2020 and our workforce has continued to work remotely. Our operations continue as we seek to comply with guidance from governmental authorities and adjust our activities as appropriate. Prior to our previously disclosed voluntary pause of our clinical trials for IMVT-1401 in February 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic had a variable impact on our clinical trials. Some of our clinical trial sites closed enrollment for new patients in early March 2020 due to COVID-19, whereas other sites remained partially open for new patient enrollment until our voluntary pause. These impacts have resulted in slower than projected patient enrollment of our trials.

In the conduct of our business activities, we continue to take actions designed to protect the safety and well-being of our clinical trial participants and employees. For participants already enrolled in our clinical trials, we are working closely with clinical trial investigators and site staff to observe government and institutional guidelines designed to safeguard the health and safety of patients, clinical trial investigators and site staff. Our very experienced clinical development team has successfully maintained robust communication with our sites. We have also been working with our partners to ensure that backup services are in place, which has enabled some virtual visits to replace in-person visits.

We have not experienced material financial impacts as a result of COVID-19 pandemic. However, the impact of COVID-19 on our future results will largely depend on future developments related to COVID-19, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate duration and spread of the outbreak, the continuing impact of the pandemic on our enrolling clinical sites, financial markets and the global economy, travel restrictions and social distancing in the United States and other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the United States and other countries to contain and treat the disease.

For additional information about risks and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic that may impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, see the section titled "Risk Factors" under Part I, Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Our Key Agreements
------------------

License Agreement with HanAll Biopharma Co., Ltd.
-------------------------------------------------

In December 2017, RSG entered into the HanAll Agreement. Under the HanAll Agreement, RSG, a wholly owned subsidiary of RSL, received (1) the non-exclusive right to manufacture and (2) the exclusive, royalty-bearing right to develop, import and use the antibody referred to as IMVT-1401 and certain back-up and nextgeneration antibodies, and products containing such antibodies, and to commercialize such products, in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the E.U., the U.K., Switzerland, the Middle East, North Africa and Latin America, or the Licensed Territory, for all human and animal uses, during the term of the agreement.

In December 2018, we obtained and assumed all rights, title, interest and obligations under the HanAll Agreement from RSG, including all rights to IMVT-1401 from RSG in the Licensed Territory, pursuant to an assignment and assumption agreement between RSG and its wholly owned subsidiary, ISG, for an aggregate purchase price of $37.8 million plus Swiss value-added tax of $2.9 million.

Table of Contents
-----------------

Under the HanAll Agreement, the parties may choose to collaborate on a research program directed to the research and development of next generation FcRn inhibitors in accordance with an agreed plan and budget. We are obligated to reimburse HanAll for half of such research and development expenses incurred by HanAll, up to an aggregate reimbursement amount of $20.0 million. Intellectual property created by HanAll pursuant to this research program will be included in our license; intellectual property created by us pursuant to this research program will be included in HanAll's license. Since the acquisition of IMVT-1401, we, along with RSL, have performed all the development associated with IMVT-1401 and no amounts were incurred by HanAll and reported to the Company for further research or development of the technology for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.

Pursuant to the HanAll Agreement, RSG made an upfront payment of $30.0 million to HanAll. In May 2019, we achieved our first development and regulatory milestone which resulted in a $10.0 million milestone payment that we subsequently paid in August 2019. We will be responsible for future contingent payments and royalties, including up to an aggregate of $442.5 million upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales milestone events. We are also obligated to pay HanAll tiered royalties ranging from the mid-single digits to mid-teens on net sales of licensed products, subject to standard offsets and reductions as set forth in the HanAll Agreement. These royalty obligations apply on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis and end upon the latest of: (A) the date on which the last valid claim of the licensed patents expire, (B) the date on which the data or market exclusivity expires or (C) 11 years after the first commercial sale of the licensed product, in each case, with respect to a given product in a given country. See " Business-License Agreement with HanAll Biopharma Co., Ltd. " for further information.

Services Agreements with RSI and RSG
------------------------------------

In August 2018, we entered into Services Agreements with RSI and RSG, under which RSI and RSG agreed to provide services related to development, administrative and financial activities to us during our formative period. Under each Services Agreement, we will pay or reimburse RSI or RSG, as applicable, for any expenses they, or third parties acting on our behalf, incur. For any general and administrative and research and development activities performed by RSI or RSG employees, RSI or RSG, as applicable, will charge back the employee compensation expense plus a pre-determined markup. RSI and RSG also provided such services prior to the formalization of the Services Agreements, and such costs have been recognized by us in the period in which the services were rendered. Employee compensation expense, inclusive of base salary and fringe benefits, is determined based upon the relative percentage of time utilized on our matters. All other costs will be billed back at cost. The term of the Services Agreements will continue until terminated by us, RSI or RSG, as applicable, upon 90 days' written notice.

RSL Information Sharing and Cooperation Agreement
-------------------------------------------------

In December 2018, we entered into an amended and restated information sharing and cooperation agreement, or the Cooperation Agreement, with RSL, which, among other things: (1) obligates us to deliver to RSL periodic financial statements and other information upon reasonable request and to comply with other specified financial reporting requirements; (2) requires us to supply certain material information to RSL to assist it in preparing any future SEC filings; and (3) requires us to implement and observe certain policies and procedures related to applicable laws and regulations. We have agreed to indemnify RSL and its affiliates and their respective officers, employees and directors against all losses arising out of, due to or in connection with RSL's status as a stockholder under the Cooperation Agreement and the operations of or services provided by RSL or its affiliates or their respective officers, employees or directors to us or any of our subsidiaries, subject to certain limitations set forth in the Cooperation Agreement. No amounts have been paid or received under this agreement; however, we believe this agreement is material to our business and operations.

Subject to specified exceptions, the Cooperation Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (1) the mutual written consent of the parties or (2) the later of when RSL no longer (a) is required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or U.S. GAAP, to consolidate our results of operations and financial position, account for its investment in us under the equity method of accounting or, by any rule of the SEC, include our separate financial statements in any filings it may make with the SEC and (b) has the right to elect directors constituting a majority of our board of directors.

Financial Operations Overview
-----------------------------

Revenue
-------

We have not generated any revenue and have incurred significant operating losses since inception, and we do not expect to generate any revenue from the sale of any products unless or until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialize IMVT-1401 or any future product candidates. Our ability to generate revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend completely on the successful development and eventual commercialization of IMVT-1401 and any future product candidates.

Table of Contents
-----------------

Research and Development Expenses
---------------------------------

We have been primarily engaged in preparing for and conducting clinical trials. Research and development expenses include program-specific costs, as well as unallocated costs.

Program-specific costs include direct third-party costs, which include expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations and the cost of consultants who assist with the development of the Company's product candidate on a program-specific basis, investigator grants, sponsored research, and any other third-party expenses directly attributable to the development of the product candidate.

Unallocated costs include:

* · Costs related to contract manufacturing operations including manufacturing costs in connection with producing materials for use in conducting preclinical and clinical studies;
* · personnel-related expenses for research and development personnel, which includes employee-related expenses such as salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs;
* · stock-based compensation expenses for research and development personnel;
* · payments upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones under the HanAll Agreement;
* · costs allocated to us under our services agreements with RSI and RSG (the "Services Agreements"); and
* · other expenses, which include the cost of consultants who assist with our research and development, but are not allocated to a specific program.

Research and development activities will continue to be central to our business model. We expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly over the next several years as we increase personnel and compensation costs, commence additional clinical trials for IMVT-1401 and prepare to seek regulatory approval for our product candidate. It is not possible to determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of any clinical trial we may conduct.

The duration, costs and timing of clinical trials of IMVT-1401 and any future product candidates will depend on a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to:

* · the number of trials required for approval;
* · the per patient trial costs;
* · the number of patients that participate in the trials;
* · the number of sites included in the trials;
* · the countries in which the trial is conducted;
* · the length of time required to enroll eligible patients;
* · the number of doses that patients receive;
* · the drop-out or discontinuation rates of patients;
* · the potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies;
* · the duration of patient follow-up;
* · the timing and receipt of regulatory approvals;
* · the potential impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic;
* · the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate; and
* · the cost of manufacturing.

In addition, the probability of success for IMVT-1401 will depend on numerous factors, including our product's efficacy, safety, ease of use, competition, manufacturing capability and commercial viability.

General and Administrative Expenses
-----------------------------------

General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and related benefits, costs allocated under the Services Agreements and stock-based compensation for general and administrative personnel, legal and accounting fees, consulting services and other operating costs relating to corporate matters and daily operations.

We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in the future to support our continued research and development activities and increased costs of operating as a public company. These increases will likely include patent-related costs, including legal and professional fees for filing, prosecution and maintenance of our product candidates, increased costs related to the hiring of additional personnel and fees to outside consultants for professional services. Additionally, we anticipate increased costs associated with being a public company, including expenses related to services associated with maintaining compliance with Nasdaq rules and SEC requirements, insurance and investor relations costs. In addition, whenever IMVT-1401 obtains regulatory approval, we expect that we would incur significant additional expenses associated with building medical affairs and commercial teams.

Interest Expense
----------------

Interest expense consisted of interest incurred on our convertible promissory notes that were settled through conversion upon the closing of the Business Combination.

| Other | 8,047 | 4,795 | 3,252 |
| Total research and development expenses | $ 68,604 | $ 47,927 | $ 20,677 |

Research and development expenses increased by $20.7 million, from $47.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2020 to $68.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2021.

Program-specific research and development costs increased by $5.2 million, from $13.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2020 to $18.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2021, due to an increase in costs related to increased clinical trial activities during the year ended March 31, 2021.

Table of Contents
-----------------

Unallocated research and development costs increased by $15.5 million, from $34.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2020 to $50.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to higher employee costs of $11.6 million, increases in contract manufacturing costs of $10.7 million and $3.2 million of other increases related to clinical studies and clinical research, partially offset by a $10.0 million payment during the year ended March 31, 2020 related to the achievement of the first development and regulatory milestone under the HanAll Agreement in May 2019. Personnel-related expenses and stock-based compensation expense increased by $7.7 million and $3.9 million, respectively, both of which were due to increasing headcount to support our expanded clinical operations. Contract manufacturing costs increased by $10.7 million from the prior year primarily reflecting increased manufacturing of materials used in our clinical trials, as well as higher costs related to analytical development, extended characterization, and drug stability. The increase in other unallocated costs primarily reflects $2.8 million of professional and consulting fees to support our increased clinical trial activities.

General and Administrative Expenses
-----------------------------------

General and administrative expenses increased by $21.4 million, from $18.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2020 to $39.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to higher personnel-related costs of $4.2 million and higher stock-based compensation expense of $8.0 million, both of which were due to higher headcount. Other increases include costs of $3.0 million related to directors' and officers' insurance, higher legal and professional fees of $2.1 million, market research costs of $1.3 million, and rent of $1.1 million to support our personnel growth and operations as a public company.

Interest Expense
----------------

Interest expense was $0.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2020 and was related to the interest accrued on our convertible promissory notes issued during the year that were settled through conversion upon the closing of the Business Combination. There was no interest expense for the year ended March 31, 2021.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
-------------------------------

Overview
--------

We had cash of $400.1 million and $100.6 million as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, we had net losses of $107.4 million and $66.4 million, respectively.

In April 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of 9,613,365 shares of our common stock (including 1,034,483 shares of common stock purchased by RSL and the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase 1,253,917 additional shares of common stock) at a price to the public of $14.50 per share, for net proceeds to us of $131.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.

During May and June 2020, an aggregate of 11,438,290 warrants were exercised for an aggregate of 5,719,145 shares of our common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, for net proceeds to us of $65.8 million.

In September 2020, we completed an underwritten public offering of 6,060,606 shares of our common stock (including 380,000 shares of common stock purchased by RSL and the full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase 790,513 additional shares of common stock) at a price to the public of $33.00 per share, for net proceeds to the Company of approximately $188.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.

In January 2021, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC which permits the offering, issuance and sale by us of up to a maximum aggregate offering price of $900 million of our common stock, of which $150 million may be issued and sold pursuant to an at-the-market (ATM) offering program for sales of our common stock under a sales agreement with SVB Leerink LLC, subject to certain conditions as specified in the sales agreement. We agreed to pay SVB Leerink up to 3% of the gross proceeds sold through the sale agreement. Our common stock would be sold at prevailing market prices at the time of the sale and, as a result, prices may vary. We have not issued or sold any securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement or ATM offering program.

Table of Contents
-----------------

We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses at least for the next several years. We have never generated any revenue and we do not expect to generate product revenue unless and until we successfully complete development and obtain regulatory approval for IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate. Our net losses may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year, depending on the timing of our planned clinical trials, timing of IMVT1401 manufacturing, HanAll milestone payments and our expenditures on other research and development activities. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially as we:

* · fund our clinical trials of IMVT-1401;
* · fund our clinical development programs;
* · launch any potential Phase 2 proof-of-concept studies of IMVT-1401 in additional indications;
* · incur costs associated with the pause, analysis and safety review of the clinical trials of IMVT-1401;
* · achieve milestones under our agreements with third parties, including the HanAll Agreement, that will require us to make substantial payments to those parties;
* · seek to identify, acquire, develop and commercialize additional product candidates;
* · integrate acquired technologies into a comprehensive regulatory and product development strategy;
* · maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;
* · hire scientific, clinical, quality control and administrative personnel;
* · add operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our drug development efforts;
* · commence the number of trials required for approval;
* · seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;
* · ultimately establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure and scale up external manufacturing capabilities to commercialize any drug candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval; and
* · incur insurance, legal and other regulatory compliance expenses to operate as a public company.

Our primary use of cash is to fund our clinical trials and clinical development activities. Our current funds will not be sufficient to enable us to complete all necessary development and commercially launch IMVT-1401. We anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future.

Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenue from sales of IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings and potential collaboration, license or development agreements. Our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely impacted by potential worsening global economic conditions and the recent disruptions to, and volatility in, the credit and financial markets in the United States and worldwide resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We do not currently have any committed external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, your ownership interest will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.

If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may be required to relinquish valuable rights to future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our drug development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves or potentially discontinue operations.

Cash Flows
----------

The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):

Table of Contents

| | Years Ended March 31, | Years Ended March 31, |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | 2021 | 2020 |
| Net cash used in operating activities | $ (83,327) | $ (53,357) |
| Net cash used in investing activities | (210) | (31) |
| Net cash provided by financing activities | 383,112 | 146,974 |

Operating Activities
--------------------

Cash provided by operating activities represents the cash receipts and disbursements related to all of our activities other than investing and financing activities. Operating cash flow is derived by adjusting our net loss for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. For the year ended March 31, 2021, $83.3 million of cash was used in operating activities. This was primarily attributable to a net loss from operations for the year of $107.4 million, partially offset by non-cash charges of $19.5 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $4.6 million. The non-cash charges consisted mainly of stock-based compensation of $18.8 million, reflecting the higher headcount to support increased research and development and business operations during the year ended March 31, 2021. The change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase of $5.7 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses, primarily driven by increased research and development efforts as well as higher general and administrative activities, and the settlement of a $3.0 million value-added tax receivable in April 2020. These changes were partially offset by an increase of $2.9 million in prepaid expenses, driven by the timing of payments related to clinical research and contract manufacturing activities.

For the year ended March 31, 2020, $53.4 million of cash was used in operating activities. This was primarily attributable to a net loss from operations for the year of $66.4 million, non-cash charges of $8.2 million and a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $4.8 million. The non-cash charges consisted mainly of stock-based compensation of $7.0 million and $1.6 million from the write-off of deferred offering costs. The change in our operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase of $7.5 million in accounts payable and accrued expenses, primarily driven by increased research and development efforts and general and administrative activities, partially offset by an increase of $2.8 million in prepaid expenses.

Investing Activities
--------------------

For the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, cash used in investing activities was related to the purchase of computer equipment.

Financing Activities
--------------------

For the year ended March 31, 2021, $383.1 million of cash provided by financing activities consisted of $319.1 million in cash received, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses, as a result of the follow-on public offerings in April 2020 and September 2020 and $65.8 million from the issuance of common stock as a result of the redemption of outstanding warrants, partially offset by the repayment of a note payable to RSL.

For the year ended March 31, 2020, $147.0 million of cash provided by financing activities consisted of $111.0 million in cash received as a result of the Business Combination, $35.0 million in proceeds from the issuance of convertible promissory notes, $7.9 million from the issuance of promissory notes to RSL, and $1.2 million in capital contributions by RSL, partially offset by $5.0 million in repayments of convertible promissory notes and the payment of offering costs of $3.1 million.

Outlook
-------

Based on our existing cash balance as of March 31, 2021 of $400.1 million, our research and development plans and our timing expectations related to our development programs for IMVT-1401, we expect to be able to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of the calendar year 2023. However, we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we expect.

Contractual Obligations and Commitments
---------------------------------------

As of March 31, 2021, other than contingent payments pursuant to the HanAll Agreement and sublease agreements (as discussed below), we did not have any ongoing material financial commitments, such as lines of credit or guarantees, that we expect to affect our liquidity over the next several years.

Table of Contents
-----------------

In the normal course of business, we enter into agreements with CROs for clinical trials and with vendors for nonclinical studies, manufacturing and other services and products for operating purposes, which agreements are cancellable by us at any time, subject to payment of remaining obligations under binding purchase orders and, in certain cases, nominal early-termination fees. These commitments are not deemed significant.

We have not included potential future payments due under the HanAll Agreement in a table of contractual obligations because the payment obligations under this agreement are contingent upon future events. As of March 31, 2021, the aggregate maximum amount of milestone payments we could be required to make under the HanAll Agreement is $442.5 million upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales milestone events. In May 2019, we achieved our first development and regulatory milestone under the HanAll Agreement resulting in a $10.0 million milestone payment that was paid by us in August 2019. We are also required to reimburse HanAll for half of budgeted research and development costs incurred by HanAll with respect to IMVT-1401, up to an aggregate of $20.0 million.

Sublease Agreements
-------------------

In June 2020, we entered into two sublease agreements with RSI, for the two floors of the building that serves as our headquarters in New York. The subleases will expire on February 27, 2024 and April 29, 2024, respectively, and have scheduled rent increases each year. The future fixed operating lease payments under both sublease agreements are $3.5 million over a lease period of approximately three years.

In April 2020, we entered into a sublease agreement with an unrelated party for one floor of a building in North Carolina. The sublease will expire on February 28, 2022 and has no scheduled rent increases. The future fixed operating lease payments under the sublease agreement are $0.1 million over the remaining lease period of 11 months.

For more information on such subleases, see " Note 11 - Leases " to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10K.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
------------------------------

During the periods presented, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined under SEC rules.

Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Our management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet, and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

We define our critical accounting policies as those under U.S. GAAP that require us to make subjective estimates and judgments about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations, as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in "Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements that require significant estimates and judgments.

Research and Development Expenses
---------------------------------

Research and development costs with no alternative future use are expensed as incurred. We accrue costs for clinical trial activities based upon estimates of the services received and related expenses incurred that have yet to be invoiced by contract research organizations. In making these estimates, we consider various factors, including status and timing of services performed, the number of patients enrolled and the rate of patient enrollment. Payments for a product license prior to regulatory approval of the product and payments for milestones achieved prior to regulatory approval of the product are expensed in the period incurred as research and development expenses. Research and development costs are charged to expense when incurred and primarily consist of employee compensation and expenses from third parties who conduct research and development activities (including manufacturing) on our behalf.

Table of Contents
-----------------

Stock-Based Compensation
------------------------

We recognize stock-based compensation expense related to stock options based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant. We estimate the grant date fair value, and the resulting stock-based compensation expense, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Restricted stock units are valued at the market price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The grant date fair value of the stock-based awards with graded vesting is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. We account for forfeitures as they occur. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions, which determine the fair value of stock-based awards. These assumptions include:

Expected Term . The expected term represents the period that our stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined using the simplified method (based on the mid-point between the vesting date and the end of the contractual term).

Expected Volatility . Prior to the Business Combination, we were a privately-held company and did not have any trading history for our common stock. The expected volatility was estimated using weighted average measures of implied volatility and the historical volatility of our peer group of companies for a period equal to the expected life of the stock options. Our peer group of publicly-traded biopharmaceutical companies was chosen based on their similar size, stage in the life cycle or area of specialty. Because we do not have an extended trading history for our shares of common stock since the closing of the Business Combination, the method used to estimate the expected volatility remained unchanged.

Risk-Free Interest Rate . The risk-free interest rate is based on the rates paid on securities issued by the U.S. Treasury with a term approximating the expected life of the stock options.

Expected Dividend . We have never paid, and do not anticipate paying, cash dividends on our common stock. Therefore, the expected dividend yield was assumed to be zero.

Prior to the closing of the Business Combination, the fair value of our common stock was estimated on each grant date by our board of directors. In order to determine the fair value of our common stock, our board of directors considered, among other things, timely valuations of our common stock prepared by an unrelated third-party valuation firm in accordance with the guidance provided by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation . Given the absence of a public trading market for our common stock, our board of directors exercised reasonable judgment and considered a number of objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common stock, including (1) our business, financial condition and results of operations, including related industry trends affecting our operations; (2) our forecasted operating performance and projected future cash flows; (3) the illiquid nature of our common stock; (4) the rights and privileges of our common stock; (5) market multiples of our most comparable public peers and (6) market conditions affecting our industry.

After the closing of the Business Combination, our board of directors determined the fair value of each share of common stock underlying stock-based awards based on the closing price of our common stock as reported by Nasdaq on the date of grant.

A component of total stock-based compensation expense relates to the RSL common stock awards and options issued by RSL to its employees. Stock-based compensation expense is allocated to us by RSL based upon the relative percentage of time utilized by RSL employees on our matters. The fair value of the RSL common stock awards is determined on the date of grant and that fair value is recognized over the requisite service period. Significant judgment and estimates were used to estimate the fair value of these awards and options, as they are not publicly traded. RSL common share awards and options are subject to specified vesting schedules and requirements (a combination of time-based, performance-based and corporate event-based vesting terms, including targets for post-IPO market capitalization and future financing events of RSL). The fair value of each RSL option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

Opinion on the Financial Statements
-----------------------------------

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Immunovant, Inc. (the Company) as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended March 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at March 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended March 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated June 1, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion
-----------------

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter
---------------------

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.

| | Clinical Trial Accrual |
| --- | --- |
| Description of the Matter | As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company accrues costs for clinical trial activities based upon estimates of the services received and related expenses incurred that have yet to be invoiced by contract research organizations. In making these estimates, the Company considers various factors, including status and timing of services performed, the number of patients enrolled and the rate of patient enrollment. Auditing the Company's accrual for clinical trial costs is especially complex due to the fact that information necessary to estimate the accruals is accumulated from clinical research organizations and the Company's assessment of that information is subject to |
| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls that addressed the identified risks related to the information used in the Company's process for recording accrued clinical trial costs. For example, we tested controls over management's review of clinical trial progress in comparison to information and invoices received from third parties, and over the completeness and accuracy of data used to calculate the accrual. |

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
----------------------------------------------------

We have audited Immunovant, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Immunovant, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of March 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended March 31, 2021, and the related notes and our report dated June 1, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion
-----------------

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Note 1 - Organization and Nature of Business
--------------------------------------------

[A] Description of Business
---------------------------

Immunovant, Inc. together with its wholly owned subsidiaries (the "Company" or "Immunovant") (formerly known as Health Sciences Acquisitions Corporation) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on enabling normal lives for people with autoimmune diseases. The Company is developing a novel, fully human monoclonal antibody, IMVT-1401 (formerly referred to as "RVT-1401"), that selectively binds to and inhibits the neonatal fragment crystallizable receptor. The Company intends to develop IMVT-1401 for indications in which there is robust evidence that pathogenic immunoglobulin G antibodies drive disease manifestation and for which reduction of these antibodies should lead to clinical benefit for patients with autoimmune diseases.

The Company has determined that it hasone operating and reporting segment.

Reverse Recapitalization
------------------------

On December 18, 2019, Health Sciences Acquisitions Corporation ("HSAC") completed the acquisition of Immunovant Sciences Ltd. ("ISL") pursuant to the share exchange agreement dated as of September 29, 2019 (the "Share Exchange Agreement"), by and among HSAC, ISL, the stockholders of ISL (the "Sellers"), and Roivant Sciences Ltd. ("RSL"), as representative of the Sellers (the "Business Combination"). As of immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination, the Sellers owned 100% of the issued and outstanding common shares of ISL ("ISL Shares"). At the closing of the Business Combination, HSAC acquired100% of the issued and outstanding ISL Shares, in exchange for 42,080,376 shares of HSAC's common stock issued to the Sellers and10,000 shares of HSAC Series A preferred stock issued to RSL. Upon the closing of the Business Combination, ISL became a wholly owned subsidiary of HSAC and HSAC was renamed "Immunovant, Inc."

The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization and HSAC was treated as the "acquired" company for accounting purposes. The Business Combination was accounted as the equivalent of ISL issuing stock for the net assets of HSAC, accompanied by a recapitalization. Accordingly, all historical financial information presented in these consolidated financial statements represents the accounts of ISL and its wholly owned subsidiaries "as if" ISL is the predecessor to the Company. The shares prior to the Business Combination have been retroactively restated as shares reflecting the exchange ratio established in the Business Combination (0.48906624 Immunovant, Inc. shares for 1 ISL Share).

ISL was founded on July 6, 2018 as a Bermuda exempted limited company and a wholly owned subsidiary of RSL. In July and August 2018, ISL incorporated its wholly owned subsidiaries, Immunovant Sciences Holdings Ltd. ("ISHL"), a private limited company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the laws of England and Wales, IMVT Corporation (formerly, Immunovant, Inc.), a Delaware corporation based in the United States of America, and Immunovant Sciences GmbH ("ISG"), a limited liability company formed under the laws of Switzerland. ISG holds all of the Company's intellectual property rights. HSAC was incorporated in Delaware on December 6, 2018 and was formed as a blank check company for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. References herein to "date of formation" or "date of inception" refer to the founding of ISL.

One of the primary purposes of the Business Combination was to provide a platform for ISL to gain access to the U.S. capital markets. See Note 3 - Business Combination and Recapitalization for additional details on the Business Combination.

[B] Liquidity
-------------

The Company has incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception. As of March 31, 2021, the Company's cash totaled $ 400.1 million and its accumulated deficit was $198.7 million.

The Company has not generated any revenues to date and does not anticipate generating any revenues unless and until it successfully completes development and obtains regulatory approval for IMVT-1401 or any future product candidate. Management expects to incur additional losses in the future to fund its operations and conduct product research and development and recognizes the need to raise additional capital to fully implement its business plan.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
------------------------------------------

Table of Contents
-----------------

The Company intends to raise such additional capital through the issuance of equity securities, debt financings or other sources in order to further implement its business plan. However, if such financing is not available at adequate levels, the Company will need to reevaluate its operating plan and may be required to delay the development of its product candidates. The Company currently expects that its existing cash as of March 31, 2021 will be sufficient to fund its operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second half of the calendar year 2023 from the date the consolidated financial statements are issued.

Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. The Company has no unconsolidated subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

[B] Use of Estimates
--------------------

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to assets, liabilities, stock-based compensation, litigation accruals, clinical trial accruals, operating leases, research and development costs and income taxes. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Additionally, the Company assessed the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on its operations and financial results as of March 31, 2021 and through the issuance of this report. The Company's analysis was informed by the facts and circumstances as they were known to the Company. This assessment considered the impact COVID-19 may have on financial estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and expenses.

[C] Risks and Uncertainties
---------------------------

The Company is subject to risks common to early-stage companies in the biopharmaceutical industry including, but not limited to, uncertainties related to commercialization of products, regulatory approvals, dependence on key products, key personnel and third-party service providers such as contract research organizations, protection of intellectual property rights and the ability to make milestone, royalty or other payments due under any license, collaboration or supply agreements.

[D] Concentration of Credit Risk
--------------------------------

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk include cash. At March 31, 2021, the cash balance is kept in one banking institution that the Company believes is of high credit quality and is in excess of federally insured levels. The Company maintains its cash with an accredited financial institution and accordingly, such funds are subject to minimal credit risk. The Company has not experienced any losses on its cash.

[E] Cash and Cash Equivalents
-----------------------------

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. At March 31, 2021, cash consisted of cash held at a financial institution. There were no cash equivalents as of March 31, 2021 and 2020.

Table of Contents
-----------------

[F] Property and Equipment
--------------------------

Property and equipment, consisting of computers, is recorded at cost. Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are expensed to operations as incurred. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of three years. Upon disposal, retirement or sale, the related cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the consolidated statements of operations.

[G] Impairment of Long-lived Assets
-----------------------------------

Long-lived assets, such as right-of-use assets due to operating leases, property and equipment, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If circumstances require a long-lived asset to be tested for possible impairment, the Company first compares undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by an asset to the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset is not recoverable on an undiscounted cash flow basis, impairment is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds its fair value. Fair value is determined through various valuation techniques including discounted cash flow models, quoted market values and third-party independent appraisals, as considered necessary.

[H] Contingencies
-----------------

The Company, from time to time, may be a party to various disputes and claims arising from normal business activities. The Company continually assesses litigation to determine if an unfavorable outcome would lead to a probable loss or reasonably possible loss which could be estimated. The Company accrues for all contingencies at the earliest date at which the Company deems it probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely than another, the Company accrues the minimum of the range. In the cases where the Company believes that a reasonably possible loss exists, the Company discloses the facts and circumstances of the litigation, including an estimable range, if possible. Legal defense costs associated with loss contingencies are expensed in the period incurred. Additionally, the Company records a receivable for rights to insurance recoveries, limited to the extent of incurred or probable losses, when such recoveries have been agreed to with third-party insurers and when receipt is deemed probable. This includes instances when the third-party insurers have agreed to pay, on the Company's behalf, certain legal defense costs and settlement amounts directly to applicable law firms and settlement funds.

[I] Research and Development Expenses
-------------------------------------

Research and development costs with no alternative future use are expensed as incurred. Payments for a product license prior to regulatory approval of the product and payments for milestones achieved prior to regulatory approval of the product are expensed in the period incurred as research and development. Milestone payments made in connection with regulatory approvals are capitalized and amortized to cost of product sales over the remaining useful life of the asset. Research and development expenses primarily consist of employee-related costs, milestone payments under the HanAll Agreement and expenses from third parties who conduct research and development activities (including manufacturing) on behalf of the Company. The Company accrues costs for clinical trial activities based upon estimates of the services received and related expenses incurred that have yet to be invoiced by contract research organizations. In making these estimates, the Company considers various factors, including status and timing of services performed, the number of patients enrolled and the rate of patient enrollment. The Company accrues costs for non-clinical studies and contract manufacturing activities over the service periods specified in the contracts and are adjusted as necessary based upon an ongoing review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred. The estimate of the work completed is developed through discussions with internal personnel and external services providers as to the progress toward completion of the services and the agreed-upon fee to be paid for such services. As actual costs become known, the accrued estimates are adjusted. Such estimates are not expected to be materially different from amounts actually incurred.

Table of Contents
-----------------

[J] Leases
----------

The Company's operating leases primarily relate to itsthree subleased premises, two in New York and one in North Carolina. Operating lease right-of-use ("ROU") assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset during the lease term, and operating lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are initially recognized based on the present value of the future fixed lease payments over the expected lease term at commencement date calculated using the Company's incremental borrowing rate applicable to the lease asset, unless the implicit rate is readily determinable. Operating lease ROU assets also include any lease payments made at or before lease commencement, adjusted by any initial direct costs and exclude any lease incentives received. The Company determines the lease term as the non-cancelable period of the lease and may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recognized on the consolidated balance sheets. Lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease costs such as common area costs and other operating costs are expensed as incurred.

The Company accounts for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for all its facilities leases.

[K] Income Taxes
----------------

The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income tax (benefit) expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.

The Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations. If the Company determines that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount, the Company would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.

The Company has not recognized U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which the Company has determined to be indefinitely reinvested.

When uncertain tax positions exist, the Company recognizes the tax benefit of tax positions to the extent that the benefit will more likely than not be realized. The determination as to whether the tax benefit will more likely than not be realized is based upon the technical merits of the tax position as well as consideration of the available facts and circumstances. The Company's policy is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in provision for income taxes.

[L] Stock-based Compensation
----------------------------

Stock-based awards to employees and directors are valued at fair value on the date of the grant and that fair value is recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period. The grant date fair value of the stock-based awards with graded vesting is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective awards. The Company values its stock options that only have service vesting requirements or performance-based awards without market conditions using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For performance-based awards with market conditions, the Company determines the fair value of awards as of the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Stock-based compensation related to restricted stock awards is based on the fair value of the Company's common stock on the grant date.

Certain assumptions need to be made with respect to utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model, including the expected life of the award, volatility of the underlying shares, the risk-free interest rate, expected dividend yield and the fair value of the Company's common stock. Since the Company has limited option exercise history, it has generally elected to estimate the expected life of an award based upon the "simplified method" with the continued use of this method extended until such time the Company has sufficient exercise history. The expected share price volatility for the Company's common stock is estimated by taking the average historical price volatility for the Company's peers. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rates paid on securities issued by the U.S. Treasury with a term approximating the expected life of the equity award. As the Company has never paid and does not anticipate paying cash dividends on its common stock, the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero. The Company accounts for pre-vesting award forfeitures when they occur.

Table of Contents
-----------------

As part of the valuation of stock-based compensation under the Black-Scholes option pricing model, it is necessary for the Company to estimate the fair value of its common stock. Prior to the closing of the Business Combination, the fair value of the Company's common stock was estimated on each grant date by the Company's board of directors. Given the absence of a public trading market, and in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation , the Company exercised reasonable judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine its best estimate of the fair value of its common stock. The estimation of the fair value of the common stock considered factors including the following: the estimated present value of the Company's future cash flows; the Company's business, financial condition and results of operations; the Company's forecasted operating performance; the illiquid nature of the Company's common stock; industry information such as market size and growth; market capitalization of comparable companies and the estimated value of transactions such companies have engaged in; and macroeconomic conditions.

After the closing of the Business Combination, the Company's board of directors determined the fair value of each share of common stock underlying stock-based awards based on the closing price of the Company's common stock as reported by Nasdaq on the date of grant.

Determining the appropriate amount to expense for performance-based awards based on the achievement of stated goals requires judgment. The estimate of expense is revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the required performance targets and adjustments are made as appropriate. The cumulative impact of any revisions is reflected in the period of change. If any applicable financial performance goals are not met, no compensation expense is recognized, and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed.

[M] Fair Value of Financial Instruments
---------------------------------------

The Company applies a fair value framework in order to measure and disclose its financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available, and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

* · Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
* · Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Fair values are determined by utilizing quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or other market observable inputs such as interest rates and yield curves.
* · Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

To the extent the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greate st for instruments categorized in Level 3. A financial instrument's level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

The Company's financial instruments consist of cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses and amounts due to RSL. These financial instruments are stated at their respective historical carrying amounts, which approximate fair value due to their short-term nature. There were no Level 2 or Level 3 financial instruments as of March 31, 2021 or 2020.

[N] Foreign Currency
--------------------

The Company has operations in the United States, the United Kingdom, Bermuda, and Switzerland. The results of its non-U.S. dollar based functional currency operations are translated to U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates during the period. The Company's assets and liabilities are translated using the current exchange rate as of the consolidated balance sheet date and equity is translated using historical rates. Adjustments resulting from the translation of the consolidated financial statements of the Company's foreign functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars are excluded from the determination of net loss and are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are included in other income, net in the consolidated statements of operations.

[O] Net Loss per Common Share
-----------------------------

Basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss applicable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss applicable to common stockholders by the diluted weighted-average number of common stock outstanding during the period. In periods in which the Company reports a net loss, all common stock equivalents are deemed anti-dilutive such that basic net loss per common share and diluted net loss per common share are equivalent. Potentially dilutive common stock has been excluded from the diluted net loss per common share computations in all periods presented because such securities have an anti-dilutive effect on net loss per common share due to the Company's net loss. There are no reconciling items used to calculate the weighted-average number of total common stock outstanding for basic and diluted net loss per common share data.

The following potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per common share due to their anti-dilutive effect:

Table of Contents

| | Years Ended March 31, | Years Ended March 31, |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | 2021 | 2020 |
| Preferred stock as converted | 10,000 | 10,000 |
| Restricted stock (unvested) | 1,095,676 | 1,800,000 |
| Stock options | 7,988,999 | 3,873,888 |
| Warrants (See Note 9) | - | 5,750,000 |
| Earnout shares (See Note 3) | - | 20,000,000 |
| Total | 9,094,675 | 31,433,888 |

In addition, the convertible promissory notes issued during the year ended March 31, 2020 were not included in the calculation of diluted weighted-average number of common shares outstanding because they were anti-dilutive given the net loss of the Company.

[P] Deferred Offering Costs
---------------------------

Legal, accounting and other costs directly attributable to the issuance of the Company's equity are capitalized within deferred offering costs on the consolidated balance sheets and reclassified to equity upon issuance of the shares. Offering costs comprised of legal and accounting fees and other costs incurred through June 30, 2019 were directly related to ISL's proposed initial public offering ("IPO"). In August 2019, ISL's board of directors determined to suspend ISL's IPO registration process. Accordingly, the Company has written off deferred offering costs previously capitalized to general and administrative expenses within the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended March 31, 2020. Deferred offering costs as of March 31, 2020 represented financing costs deferred for the follow-on underwritten public offering in April 2020.

[Q] Common Stock Warrants
-------------------------

The Company accounts for the issuance of common stock warrants based on the terms of the contract and whether there are any requirements for the Company to net cash settle the contract under any terms or conditions. Warrants for the purchase of 5,750,000 shares of common stock were issued by HSAC as part of the units sold in its IPO in May 2019. Each unit was comprised of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase one half of one share of common stock upon the consummation of a business combination by HSAC. The warrants were classified as equity. None of the terms of the warrants were modified as a result of the Business Combination. During the year, the Company redeemed 11,438,290 warrants by issuing 5,719,145 shares of the Company's common stock and the remaining61,710 warrants were cancelled. No warrants remain outstanding as of March 31, 2021. See Note 9 - Stockholders' Equity for additional details about common stock warrants.

[R] Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
----------------------------------------------

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework - Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement ("ASU 2018-13"). ASU 2018-13 removes, modifies, and adds certain recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurement disclosures, including removing disclosures around the amount(s) of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the policy for timing of transfers between levels, and the valuation process for Level 3 fair value measurements, among other things. ASU 2018-13 adds disclosure requirements around changes in unrealized gains and losses included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period, the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements, and a narrative description of measurement uncertainty. The amendments in ASU 2018-13 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company has adopted ASU 2018-13 as of April 1, 2020, with no impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements from the adoption of this new standard.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ("ASU 201613"), which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss model that requires the use of forward-looking information to calculate credit loss estimates. It also eliminates the concept of other-than-temporary impairment and requires credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses instead of as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in any interim period. The Company has adopted ASU 2016-13 as of April 1, 2020, with no impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements from the adoption of this new standard.

Recent authoritative guidance issued by the FASB (including technical corrections to the Accounting Standards Codification), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") did not, or are not expected to, have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

Note 3 - Business Combination and Recapitalization
--------------------------------------------------

As discussed in Note 1, on December 18, 2019, HSAC completed the acquisition of ISL and acquired100% of the ISL Shares in exchange for42,080,376 shares of HSAC common stock issued to the Sellers and 10,000 shares of HSAC Series A preferred stock issued to RSL. The Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization whereby HSAC was treated as the "acquired" company for accounting purposes. This determination was primarily based on the fact that subsequent to the Business Combination, the Sellers have a majority of the voting power of the combined company, ISL will comprise all of the ongoing operations of the combined entity, a majority of the governing body of the combined company, and ISL's senior management will comprise all of the senior management of the combined company. The Business Combination was accounted as the equivalent of ISL issuing stock for the net assets of HSAC, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of HSAC were stated at historical cost with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded. Reported amounts from operations included herein prior to the Business Combination are those of ISL. The shares, options and net loss per share available to holders of the Company's common stock, prior to the Business Combination, have been retroactively restated as shares reflecting the exchange ratio established in the Business Combination (0.48906624 Immunovant, Inc. shares for 1 ISL Share).

The aggregate value of the consideration paid by HSAC in the Business Combination was $420.9 million, consisting of 42,080,376 shares of HSAC's common stock and 10,000 shares of HSAC's Series A preferred stock, in each case, valued at $10.00 per share (the deemed value of the shares issued pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement). The closing price per share on the date of the closing of the Business Combination on December 18, 2019 was $13.88. As the Business Combination was accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, the $10.00 per share value is disclosed for informational purposes only in order to indicate the fair value of shares transferred. In addition, pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, all vested or unvested outstanding options to purchase common shares of ISL under its 2018 Equity Incentive Plan were automatically assumed by the Company and converted into options to purchase 4,408,287 shares of the Company's common stock with no changes to the terms of the awards.

In connection with the Business Combination and Recapitalization, the Company incurred direct and incremental costs of $2.8 million, consisting of legal, accounting, financial advisory and other professional fees, which are included in additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2020. The Company incurred additional financial advisory fees related to the Business Combination of $2.3 million, which are included in accumulated deficit within the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2020.

Earnout Shares
--------------

Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Sellers were entitled to receive up to an aggregate of20,000,000 additional shares of the Company's common stock (the "Earnout Shares") if the volume-weighted average price of the Company's shares equals or exceeds the following prices for any 20 trading days within any 30 tradingday period (the "Trading Period") following December 18, 2019, the date of the closing of the Business Combination:

* (i) during any Trading Period prior to March 31, 2023,10,000,000 Earnout Shares upon the achievement of a volume-weighted average price of at least $17.50 per share (the "First Earnout Milestone"); and
* (ii) during any Trading Period prior to March 31, 2025,10,000,000 Earnout Shares upon the achievement of a volume-weighted average price of at least $31.50 per share (the "Second Earnout Milestone").

On May 12 and September 17, 2020, the Company achieved the First Earnout Milestone and the Second Earnout Milestone, respectively. Accordingly, the Company issued all of the 20,000,000 Earnout Shares to the Sellers (including17,547,938 Earnout Shares issued to RSL) during the year ended March 31, 2021.

Sponsor Restricted Stock Agreement
----------------------------------

In accordance with that certain restricted stock agreement, dated September 29, 2019, by and between HSAC and Health Sciences Holdings, LLC (the "Sponsor"), the Sponsor subjected 1,800,000 shares of its common stock ("Sponsor Restricted Shares") to potential forfeiture, with900,000 shares to vest and be released from potential forfeiture upon achievement of each of the First Earnout Milestone and the Second Earnout Milestone (as defined above), respectively. On May 12 and September 17, 2020, the Company achieved the First Earnout Milestone and the Second Earnout Milestone, respectively, and, as a result, all of the 1,800,000 Sponsor Restricted Shares vested and are no longer subject to forfeiture.

Registration Rights
-------------------

In May 2019, HSAC entered into a registration rights agreement with the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor was granted certain rights relating to the registration of securities of HSAC held by the Sponsor.

In September 2019, concurrent with the execution of the Share Exchange Agreement, HSAC, the Sponsor and the Sellers entered into an amended and restated registration rights agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement"), which became effective as of the closing of the Business Combination. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, the Sponsor and the Sellers hold registration rights that obligate the Company to register for resale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") all or any portion of the Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) held by the Sponsor and the Sellers. Each of the Sponsor, RSL and stockholders holding a majority-in-interest of all such Registrable Securities will be entitled to make a written demand for registration under the Securities Act of all or part of their Registrable Securities, so long as such shares are not then restricted under certain lock-up agreements. Subject to certain exceptions, if the Company proposes to file a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to the Company's securities, under the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company will give notice to the Sponsor and the Sellers as to the proposed filing and offer such stockholders an opportunity to register the resale of such number of their Registrable Securities as they request in writing, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, such stockholders will be entitled under the Registration Rights Agreement to request in writing that the Company register the resale of any or all of their Registrable Securities on Form S-3 or any other registration statement that may be available at such time.

The Registration Rights do not meet the definition of a registration payment arrangement as there are no terms that require the Company to transfer consideration to the various security holders if a registration statement is not declared effective or effectiveness is not maintained.

See Note 9 - Stockholders' Equity for details of the Company's capital stock prior to and subsequent to the Business Combination and Recapitalization transaction.

Note 4 - Material Agreements
----------------------------

License Agreement
-----------------

On December 19, 2017, Roivant Sciences GmbH ("RSG"), a wholly owned subsidiary of RSL, entered into a license agreement (the "HanAll Agreement") with HanAll Biopharma Co., Ltd. ("HanAll"). Under the HanAll Agreement, RSG received (1) the non-exclusive right to manufacture and (2) the exclusive, royalty-bearing right to develop, import, use and commercialize the antibody referred to as IMVT-1401 and certain back-up and next-generation antibodies, and products containing such antibodies, in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, the Middle East, North Africa and Latin America (the "Licensed Territory").

In exchange for this license, RSG provided or agreed to provide the following consideration:

* · Upfront, non-refundable payment of $30.0 million;
* · Up to $20.0 million in shared (50%) research, development, and out-of-pocket costs incurred by HanAll;
* · Up to an aggregate of $442.5 million (after a $10 million milestone payment) upon the achievement of certain additional development, regulatory and sales milestones; and
* · Tiered royalties ranging from the mid-single digits to mid-teens on net product sales subject to reduction on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the later of (1) expiration of patent and regulatory exclusivity or (2) the 11th anniversary of the first commercial sale of such product in such country.

Since the acquisition of IMVT-1401, RSL and the Company have performed all the development associated with IMVT-1401 and no amounts were incurred by HanAll and reported to the Company, to research or develop the technology for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.

On August 18, 2018, RSG entered into a sublicense agreement (the "Sublicense Agreement") with ISG to sublicense this technology, as well as RSG's knowhow and patents necessary for the development, manufacture or commercialization of any compound or product that pertains to immunology. On December 7, 2018, RSG issued a notice to terminate the Sublicense Agreement with ISG and entered into an assignment and assumption agreement to assign to ISG all the rights, title, interest, and future obligations under the HanAll Agreement from RSG, including all rights to IMVT-1401 from RSG in the Licensed Territory, for an aggregate purchase price of $37.8 million. As a result of the assignment of IMVT-1401 by RSG to ISG, the Company recorded a Swiss value-added tax receivable of $ 3.0 million, which was a reflected as a capital contribution from RSL as of March 31, 2020. In April 2020, the Company received the payment related to this receivable.

In May 2019, the Company achieved its first development and regulatory milestone under the HanAll Agreement which resulted in a $10.0 million milestone payment that the Company subsequently paid in August 2019. The milestone payment was recorded as a research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations in the period incurred.

Roivant Sciences Inc. ("RSI") and RSG Services Agreements
---------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the agreements discussed in Note 4, in August 2018, the Company entered into services agreements (the "Services Agreements") with RSI and RSG, under which RSI and RSG agreed to provide services related to development, administrative and financial activities to the Company during its formative period. Under each Services Agreement, the Company will pay or reimburse RSI or RSG, as applicable, for any expenses it, or third parties acting on its behalf, incurs for the Company. For any general and administrative and research and development activities performed by RSI or RSG employees, RSI or RSG, as applicable, will charge back the employee compensation expense plus a pre-determined mark-up. RSI and RSG also provided such services prior to the formalization of the Services Agreements, and such costs have been recognized by the Company in the period in which the services were rendered. Employee compensation expense, inclusive of base salary and fringe benefits, is determined based upon the relative percentage of time utilized on Company matters. All other costs will be billed back at cost. The term of the Services Agreements will continue until terminated by the Company, RSI or RSG, as applicable, upon 90 days' written notice. The consolidated financial statements also include third-party expenses that have been paid by RSI, RSG and RSL since the inception of the Company.

RSL Promissory Note
-------------------

In June 2019, the Company entered into an interest-free promissory note payable to RSL in the amount of $5.0 million (the "June Promissory Note"). The June Promissory Note was due and payable at the earlier of December 12, 2019 or upon demand by RSL. Subsequently, in August 2019, the Company cancelled the June Promissory Note and entered into a convertible promissory note with RSL in the amount of $5.0 million (the "RSL Convertible Promissory Note") under the same terms as other convertible promissory notes entered into with RTW Master Fund, Ltd. and RTW Innovation Master Fund, Ltd. (the "RTW Entities"). In September 2019, the Company repaid $2.5 million aggregate principal amount of the RSL Convertible Promissory Note, and accrued interest on such amount was forgiven. The remaining aggregate principal balance of the RSL Convertible Note of $2.5 million automatically converted immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination into shares of ISL exchangeable for an aggregate of 250,000 shares of the Company's common stock upon the closing of the Business Combination. All interest under the RSL Convertible Promissory Note was waived and cancelled immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination.

The July Promissory Note had a 180-day term and was payable on demand upon the expiration of the term. In May 2020, the Company paid and settled the July Promissory Note.

RSL Information Sharing and Cooperation Agreement
-------------------------------------------------

In December 2018, the Company entered into an amended and restated information sharing and cooperation agreement (the "Cooperation Agreement") with RSL. The Cooperation Agreement, among other things: (1) obligates the Company to deliver to RSL periodic financial statements and other information upon reasonable request and to comply with other specified financial reporting requirements; (2) requires the Company to supply certain material information to RSL to assist it in preparing any future SEC filings; and (3) requires the Company to implement and observe certain policies and procedures related to applicable laws and regulations. The Company has agreed to indemnify RSL and its affiliates and their respective officers, employees and directors against all losses arising out of, due to or in connection with RSL's status as a stockholder under the Cooperation Agreement and the operations of or services provided by RSL or its affiliates or their respective officers, employees or directors to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, subject to certain limitations set forth in the Cooperation Agreement. No amounts have been paid or received under this agreement; however, the Company believes this agreement is material to its business and operations.

Subject to specified exceptions, the Cooperation Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (1) the mutual written consent of the parties or (2) the later of when RSL no longer (a) is required by U.S. GAAP to consolidate the Company's results of operations and financial position, account for its investment in the Company under the equity method of accounting or, by any rule of the SEC, include the Company's separate financial statements in any filings it may make with the SEC and (b) has the right to elect directors constituting a majority of the Company's board of directors.

The Company's effective tax rate was0.33% and (0.15)% for the years ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020, respectively, primarily driven by the Company's jurisdictional earnings by location, certain non-deductible expenditures, research and development credits, and a valuation allowance that eliminates the Company's global net deferred tax assets. For the year ended March 31, 2021, the effective tax rate was also impacted by a tax benefit of approximately $0.4 million related to net operating loss carrybacks.

Deferred taxes reflect the tax effects of the differences between the amounts recorded as assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the comparable amounts recorded for income tax purposes. Significant components of the deferred tax assets (liabilities) at March 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows (in thousands):

As of March 31, 2021, the Company has net operating loss carryforwards in the following jurisdictions: Switzerland of approximately $150.6 million, which will begin to expire as of March 31, 2027, the United Kingdom of approximately $0.6 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely with an annual usage limitation, and the United States of approximately $10.0 million, which can be carried forward indefinitely with utilization limited to 80% of future taxable income for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2021. The Company has research and development credit carryforwards in the United States of approximately $2.8 million which will begin to expire in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2039, and approximately $2.2 million is subject to an annual usage limitation.

The Company assesses the realizability of the net deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date based on available positive and negative evidence in order to determine the amount which is more likely than not to be realized and record a valuation allowance as necessary. Due to the Company's cumulative loss position which provides significant negative evidence difficult to overcome, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $35.0 million and $19.1 million for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing the portion of the net deferred tax assets that is not expected to be realized. The amount of the net deferred tax assets considered realizable could be adjusted for future factors that would impact the assessment of the objective and subjective evidence of the Company. The Company will continue to assess the realizability of net deferred tax assets at each balance sheet date in order to determine the proper amount, if any, required for a valuation allowance.

As of March 31, 2021, the Company does not have undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries. The Company regularly evaluates whether foreign earnings are expected to be indefinitely reinvested. This evaluation requires judgment about the future operating and liquidity needs of the Company. Changes in economic and business conditions, foreign or U.S. tax laws, or the Company's financial situation could result in a change to the Company's position.

The Company is subject to tax and files income tax returns in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and United States federal, state, and local jurisdictions. The Company's March 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 tax returns remain open for tax examinations in all applicable income tax jurisdictions. Tax audits and examinations can involve complex issues, interpretations and judgments. The resolution of matters may span multiple years particularly if subject to litigation or negotiation. The Company believes it has appropriately recorded its tax position using reasonable estimates and assumptions, however the potential tax benefits may impact the consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the period of resolution, settlement or when the statutes of limitations expire. There are no unrecognized tax benefits recorded as of March 31, 2021 and 2020.

Prepayment of the RTW Convertible Promissory Notes prior to the maturity date was not permitted without the consent of the note holders of at least a majority of the outstanding principal amount of the convertible promissory notes issued by the Company. On September 26, 2019, such consent was obtained and $2.5 million aggregate principal amount of the RTW Convertible Promissory Notes was prepaid and the accrued interest on such principal amount was forgiven, bringing the aggregate principal balance of the RTW Convertible Promissory Notes to $22.5 million.

On September 26, 2019, the Company issued four convertible promissory notes for an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million (the "BVF Convertible Promissory Notes") payable to entities affiliated with Biotechnology Value Fund, L.P.

In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, the Company designated and issued10,000 shares of Series A preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share, to RSL, all of which shares are outstanding as of March 31, 2021.

The holder(s) of the Series A preferred stock are entitled to cast the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of common stock into which the shares of Series A preferred stock held by such holder are convertible as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on such matter, and do not have cumulative voting rights.

The holder(s) of a majority of outstanding shares of Series A preferred stock, exclusively and as a separate class, are entitled to elect: (i) four Series A preferred directors, as long as the holder(s) of Series A preferred stock hold 50% or more of the voting power of all then-outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote generally at an election of directors, (ii) three Series A preferred directors, as long as the holder(s) of Series A preferred stock hold 40% or more but less than 50% of the voting power of all then-outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote generally at an election of directors, and (iii) two Series A preferred directors, as long as the holder(s) of Series A preferred stock hold 25% or more but less than 40% of the voting power of all then-outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote generally at an election of directors. Any Series A preferred director so elected may be removed without cause by, and only by, the affirmative vote of the holder(s) of Series A preferred stock given either at a special meeting of the holder(s) of Series A preferred stock duly called for that purpose or pursuant to a written consent of the holder(s) of Series A preferred stock.

Each share of Series A preferred stock is convertible at any time at the option of the holder into one share of common stock. On any transfer of shares of Series A preferred stock, whether or not for value, each such transferred share will automatically convert into one share of common stock, except for certain transfers described in the amended and restated certificate of incorporation.

Each share of Series A preferred stock will automatically convert into one share of common stock at such time as the holder(s) of Series A preferred stock hold less than 25% of the total voting power of the Company's outstanding shares.

The Company shall not, without the consent of the holder(s) of at least a majority of Series A preferred stock, alter or repeal any provisions of the Company's amended and restated certificate of incorporation or bylaws that adversely affect the powers, preferences or rights of the Series A preferred stock.

2019 Equity Incentive Plan
--------------------------

In December 2019, in connection with the Business Combination, the Company's stockholders approved the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2019 Plan") and reserved 5,500,000 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder. The 2019 Plan became effective immediately upon the closing of the Business Combination. The number of shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2019 Plan will automatically increase on April 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2020 and continuing through April 1, 2029, by 4.0% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding on the last day of the preceding month, or a lesser number of shares as may be determined by the board of directors. The maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued pursuant to the exercise of incentive options under the 2019 Plan is 16,500,000. The Company's employees, directors and consultants are eligible to receive non-qualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock unit awards, other stock awards, and performance awards under the plan. Generally, each option will have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant and a ten-year contractual term. For grants of incentive stock options, if the grantee owns, or is deemed to own, 10% or more of the total voting power of the Company, then the exercise price shall be 110% of the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant and the option will have a five-year contractual term. Options that are forfeited, cancelled or have expired are available for future grants. On April 1, 2020, the number of common shares reserved for issuance increased automatically by 4.0% (i.e. 2,186,215 shares of common stock) in accordance with the evergreen provision of the 2019 Plan. As of March 31, 2021, options to purchase 4,777,847 shares of common stock and1,095,676 restricted stock units were outstanding under the 2019 Plan and 1,781,043 shares remained available for future grant under the 2019 Plan.

2018 Equity Incentive Plan
--------------------------

In September 2018, ISL adopted its 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2018 Plan"), under which3,667,997 shares of common stock were reserved for grant. In July 2019, the 2018 Plan was amended and restated to increase the number of shares of common stock reserved for grant to 4,768,396. As discussed in Note 3, upon the closing of the Business Combination, the Company assumed all outstanding options, whether or not vested, under the 2018 Plan, with such options henceforth representing the right to purchase a number of shares of the Company's common stock equal to approximately 0.48906624 multiplied by the number of shares of ISL common stock previously represented by such options. For accounting purposes, however, the Company is deemed to have assumed the 2018 Plan. The exchange of the stock options did not result in any incremental compensation expense, since there were no changes to the vesting terms of the awards. As of the effective date of the 2019 Plan, no further stock awards have been or will be made under 2018 Plan. As of March 31, 2021, 3,211,152 stock options were outstanding under the 2018 Plan.

Stock Option Activity

The intrinsic value of stock options exercised for the year ended March 31, 2021 was $3.7 million. There were no stock options exercised during the year ended March 31, 2020. The stock options granted during the years ended March 31, 2021 and March 31, 2020 had a weighted-average fair value of $16.17 and $5.54 per share, respectively at the grant date. The Company estimated the fair value of each stock option on the date of grant using the BlackScholes option pricing model applying the weighted-average assumptions in the following table:

| | Years Ended March 31, | Years Ended March 31, |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | 2021 | 2020 |
| Risk-free interest rate | 0.30% - 1.14% | 0.51% - 2.25% |
| Expected term, in years | 5.50 - 6.11 | 5.75 - 6.11 |
| Expected volatility | 78.16% - 84.12% | 74.69% - 77.93% |
| Expected dividend yield | -% | -% |

Stock-based Compensation Allocated to the Company by RSL
--------------------------------------------------------

In relation to the RSL common share awards and options issued by RSL to employees of RSL, RSI, RSG and the Company, stock-based compensation expense of $0.2 million and $0.2 million was recorded for years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

The RSL common share awards are valued at fair value on the date of grant and that fair value is recognized over the requisite service period. Significant judgment and estimates were used to estimate the fair value of these awards, as they are not publicly traded. RSL common share awards are subject to specified vesting schedules and requirements (a mix of time-based and performance-based events). The fair value of each RSL common share award is based on various corporate event-based considerations, including targets for RSL's post-IPO market capitalization and future financing events. The fair value of each RSL option on the date of grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

Stock-based compensation expense is allocated to the Company over the required service period over which these RSL common share awards and RSL options would vest and is based upon the relative percentage of time utilized by RSL, RSI, and RSG employees on Company matters.

RSL RSUs
--------

The Company's Principal Executive Officer was granted 25,000 RSUs of RSL during the year ended March 31, 2021. These RSUs have a requisite service period of eight years and have no dividend rights. These RSUs will vest upon the achievement of both a service requirement and liquidity event requirement during the requisite service period.

As of March 31, 2021, the liquidity event condition had not been met and was deemed not probable of being met. For the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company recorded no stock-based compensation expense related to these RSUs. At March 31, 2021, there was $1.0 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSL RSUs. The Company will recognize this stock-based compensation expense upon achievement of the service requirement and liquidity event requirement through the requisite service period.

Note 11 - Leases
----------------

In June 2020, the Company entered into two sublease agreements with RSI, for two floors of the building the Company currently occupies as its headquarters in New York. The subleases will expire on February 27, 2024 and April 29, 2024, respectively, and have scheduled rent increases each year. In April 2020, the Company entered into a sublease agreement with an unrelated party for one floor of a building in North Carolina. The sublease will expire on February 28, 2022 and has no scheduled rent increases. These leases are classified as operating leases. Operating lease ROU assets of $4.2 million and lease liabilities of $4.2 million, were recognized based on the present value of remaining fixed lease payments over the expected lease term using an incremental borrowing rate of 3.9%. As the Company's operating leases do not provide an implicit rate, estimated incremental borrowing rates based on the information available at the time of execution of sublease agreement were used in determining the present value of lease payments. The aggregate weighted-average remaining lease term was 3.0 years as of March 31, 2021. Variable lease costs such as common area costs and other operating costs are expensed as incurred and were minimal for the year ended March 31, 2021.

During the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company incurred $1.1 million in rent expense and paid $0.9 million in cash related to contractual rent obligations under the operating leases. The following table provides a reconciliation of the Company's remaining undiscounted contractual rent obligations due within each respective fiscal year ending March 31 to the operating lease liabilities recognized as of March 31, 2021 (in thousands):

Table of Contents

| Years Ending March 31, | Operating Leases |
| --- | --- |
| 2022 | 1,290 |
| 2023 | 1,152 |
| 2024 | 1,130 |
| 2025 | 47 |
| Total undiscounted payments | 3,619 |
| Less: present value adjustment | (202) |
| Present value of future payments | 3,417 |
| Less: current portion of operating lease liabilities | (1,179) |
| Operating lease liabilities, net of current portion | 2,238 |

Note 12 - Commitments and Contingencies

Indemnification Agreements
--------------------------

The Company is a party to a number of agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business that contain typical provisions that obligate the Company to indemnify the other parties to such agreements upon the occurrence of certain events. The aggregate maximum potential future liability of the Company under such indemnification provisions is uncertain. The Company also indemnifies each of its directors and officers for certain events or occurrences, subject to certain limits. The maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unlimited; however, the Company currently holds director and officer liability insurance.

Litigation
----------

The Company is involved in various lawsuits, claims and other legal matters from time to time that arise in the ordinary course of conducting business. The Company records a liability when a particular contingency is probable and estimable.

In February 2021, a putative securities class action complaint was filed against the Company and certain of its current and former officers in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York on behalf of a class consisting of those who acquired the Company's securities from October 2, 2019 and February 1, 2021. The complaint alleges that the Company and certain of its officers violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, by making false and misleading statements regarding the safety of IMVT-1401 and seeks unspecified monetary damages on behalf of the putative class and an award of costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees. On April 20, 2021, three movants filed motions for appointment as lead plaintiff, one of which was subsequently withdrawn on April 23, 2021. No hearing date has been set for the lead plaintiff motions. Following appointment of lead plaintiff, defendants, including the Company, expect the lead plaintiff to file an amended complaint and defendants, including the Company, to file a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The Company intends to defend the case vigorously and has not recorded a liability related to this lawsuit because, at this time, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate possible losses or determine whether an unfavorable outcome is either probable or remote.

Commitments
-----------

As of March 31, 2021, the Company did not have any ongoing material contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed and determinable. The Company expects to enter into other commitments as the business further develops. In the normal course of business, the Company enters into agreements with contract service providers to assist in the performance of its research and development activities. Subject to required notice periods and the Company's obligations under binding purchase orders, the Company can elect to discontinue the work under these agreements at any time. The Company expects to enter into additional collaborative research, contract research, manufacturing, and supplier agreements in the future, which may require upfront payments and long-term commitments of capital resources.

Contingencies
-------------

In March 2020, COVID-19 disease was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The COVID-19 pandemic is disrupting supply chains and affecting production and sales across a range of industries. Currently, the Company has not suffered significant adverse consequences as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the Company's future operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on employees and vendors all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. At this point, the extent to which COVID-19 may impact the Company's future financial condition or results of operations is uncertain.

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures
--------------------------------

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.
-------------------------------------------------

We maintain "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.

Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March 31, 2021, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2021 at the reasonable assurance level.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Our management, under the supervision of and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2021. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in the Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Management's assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on management's assessment, management has concluded that, as of March 31, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2021, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.
-----------------------------------------------------

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2021 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Family Relationships
--------------------

There are no family relationships between the Board and any of our executive officers.

Board Leadership Structure
--------------------------

We believe that all members of the Board should have a voice in the affairs and the management of Immunovant. The Board believes that our stockholders are best served at this time by having a chairperson, who is an integral part of our Board structure and a critical aspect of effective corporate governance. Dr. Torti has served as chairperson of the Board since the closing of the Business Combination in December 2019. Dr. Torti brings considerable skills and experience, as described above, to the role. While our Chief Executive Officer has primary responsibility for preparing the agendas for Board meetings, our chairperson has significant responsibilities, which are set forth in our corporate governance guidelines, and include, in part:

* · Establishing the agenda for regular Board meetings;
* · Coordinating with the committee chairs regarding meeting agendas and information requirements, and presiding over portions of meetings of the Board at which the evaluation or compensation of the Chief Executive Officer is presented or discussed;
* · Coordinating the activities of the other directors, and performing such other duties the Board may establish or delegate from time to time; and
* · Acting as principal liaison between the members of the Board and the Chief Executive Officer.

The active involvement of our independent directors, combined with the qualifications and significant responsibilities of our chairperson and other directors, provide balance on the Board and promote strong, independent oversight of our management and affairs.

Role of the Board in Risk Oversight
-----------------------------------

The Board and each of its committees has an active role in overseeing management of our risks. The Board regularly reviews information regarding our credit, liquidity and operations, as well as the risks associated with each. The Audit Committee's charter mandates the Audit Committee to review and discuss with management, and our independent registered public accounting firm, as appropriate, our major financial risk exposures and the steps taken by management to monitor and control these exposures. The Compensation Committee is responsible for overseeing the management of risks relating to our executive compensation plans and arrangements. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee manages risks associated with the independence of the Board and potential conflicts of interest. While each committee is responsible for evaluating certain risks and overseeing the management of such risks, the entire Board is regularly informed through committee reports about such risks.

Meetings of the Board and Its Committees
----------------------------------------

The Board met ten times during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. The Audit Committee met seven times during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. The Compensation Committee met five times during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee met two times during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021. Each director attended 75% or more of the aggregate number of meetings of the Board and of the committees on which he served, held during the portion of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 for which he was a director or committee member.

Information Regarding Committees of the Board
---------------------------------------------

The Board has an Audit Committee, a Compensation Committee and a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The following table provides membership information for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021 for each of these Board committees:

Compensation Committee Processes and Procedures
-----------------------------------------------

Typically, the Compensation Committee will meet at least twice annually and with greater frequency if necessary. The agenda for each meeting is usually developed by the Chair of the Compensation Committee, in consultation with the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. The Compensation Committee meets from time to time in executive session. In addition, from time to time, various members of management and other employees as well as outside advisors or consultants may be invited by the Compensation Committee to makepresentations, to provide financial or other background information or advice or to otherwise participate in Compensation Committee meetings. The Chief Executive Officer may not participate in, or be present during, any deliberations or determinations of the Compensation Committee regarding his compensation. The charter of the Compensation Committee grants the Compensation Committee full access to all books, records, facilities and personnel of Immunovant. In addition, under the charter, the Compensation Committee has the authority to obtain, at the expense of Immunovant, advice and assistance from compensation consultants and internal and external legal, accounting or other advisors and other external resources that the Compensation Committee considers necessary or appropriate in the performance of its duties. The Compensation Committee has direct responsibility for the oversight of the work of any consultants or advisers engaged for the purpose of advising the Committee. In particular, the Compensation Committee has the sole authority to retain, in its sole discretion, compensation consultants to assist in its evaluation of executive and director compensation, including the authority to approve the consultant's reasonable fees and other retention terms. Under the charter, the Compensation Committee may select, or receive advice from, a compensation consultant, legal counsel or other adviser to the Compensation Committee, other than in-house legal counsel and certain other types of advisers, only after taking into consideration six factors, prescribed by the SEC and Nasdaq, that bear upon the adviser's independence; however, there is no requirement that any adviser be independent.

During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021,after taking into consideration the six factors prescribed by the SEC and Nasdaq described above, the Compensation Committee engaged Compensia as its compensation consultant. The Compensation Committee requested that Compensia:

* · evaluate the efficacy of our existing compensation strategy and practices in supporting and reinforcing our long-term strategic goals; and
* · assist in refining our compensation strategy to execute that long-term strategy.

As part of its engagement, Compensia was requested by the Compensation Committee to develop a comparative group of companies and to perform analyses of competitive performance and compensation levels for that group. Compensia ultimately developed recommendations that were presented to the Compensation Committee for its consideration. Following an active dialogue with Compensia, the Compensation Committee approved the recommendations.

Under its charter, the Compensation Committee may form, and delegate authority to, subcommittees as appropriate. The Board has delegated authority to Dr. Salzmann, to whom it delegated authority to grant, without any further action required by the Compensation Committee, stock options and other equity incentives to employees who are not executive officers of Immunovant. The purpose of this delegation of authority is to enhance the flexibility of equity incentive administration within Immunovant and to facilitate the timely grant of equity incentives to non-executive officer employees, particularly new employees, within specified limits approved by the Compensation Committee or the Board.

The Compensation Committee has recommended adjustments to annual compensation, determined bonus and equity awards and established new performance objectives at one or more meetings held during the first half of the calendar year, subject to final determination by the Board. The Compensation Committee also considers matters related to individual compensation, such as compensation for new executive hires, as well as high-level strategic issues, such as the efficacy of our compensation strategy, potential modifications to that strategy and new trends, plans or approaches to compensation, at various meetings throughout the year. Generally, the Compensation Committee's process comprises two related elements: the determination of compensation levels and the establishment of performance objectives for the current year. For executives other than the Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee solicits and considers evaluations and recommendations submitted to the Committee by the Chief Executive Officer. In the case of the Chief Executive Officer, the evaluation of his performance is conducted by the Compensation Committee, which determines any adjustments to his compensation as well as awards to be granted. For all executives and directors as part of its deliberations, the Compensation Committee may review and consider, as appropriate, materials such as financial reports and projections, operational data, tax and accounting information, tally sheets that set forth the total compensation that may become payable to executives in various hypothetical scenarios, executive and director stock ownership information, company stock performance data, analyses of historical executive compensation levels and current company-wide compensation levels and recommendations of the Compensation Committee's compensation consultant, including analyses of executive and director compensation paid at other companies identified by the consultant.

Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
---------------------------------------------

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee consists of Mr. Fromkin and Drs. Torti and Venker, with Mr. Fromkin as the chairperson of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee. The principal duties and responsibilities, among others, of our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee include:

* · assessing the need for new directors and identifying individuals qualified to become directors;
* · recommending to the Board the persons to be nominated for election as directors and to each of the Board's committees;
* · assessing individual director performance, participation and qualifications;
* · recommending and overseeing the implementation of and monitoring compliance with, our corporate governance guidelines, and periodically reviewing and recommending any necessary or appropriate changes to our corporate governance guidelines;
* · monitoring the effectiveness of the Board and the quality of the relationship between management and the Board; and
* · overseeing the periodic evaluation of the Board's performance.

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee evaluates director nominees for election to the Board by our stockholders at the annual meeting of stockholders in the context of the current composition of the Board, our operating requirements and the long-term interests of our stockholders. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee and the Board believe that such candidates should have certain minimum qualifications, including the ability to read and understand basic financial statements, being over 21 years of age and having the highest personal integrity and ethics. In considering candidates for election to the Board by the holders of our common stock, other factors will also be considered, such as possessing relevant expertise upon which to be able to offer advice and guidance to management, having sufficient time to devote to the affairs of Immunovant, demonstrated excellence in his or her field, having the ability to exercise sound business judgment, diversity and having the commitment to rigorously represent the long-term interests of our stockholders. In conducting this assessment, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider the minimum Board membership criteria described above, as well as diversity, age, skills and such other factors as it deems appropriate, given the current needs of the Board and our business, to maintain a balance of knowledge, experience and capability.

In the case of incumbent directors whose terms of office are set to expire at the annual meeting of stockholders, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee reviews these directors' overall service to us during their terms, including the number of meetings attended, level of participation, quality of performance and any other relationships and transactions that might impair the directors' independence. In the case of new director candidates for election to the Board by holders of our common stock, the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee also determines whether the nominee is independent for Nasdaq purposes, which determination is based upon applicable Nasdaq listing standards, applicable SEC rules and regulations and the advice of counsel, if necessary. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee then uses its network of contacts to compile a list of potential candidates, but may also engage, if it deems appropriate, a professional search firm. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee conducts any appropriate and necessary inquiries into the backgrounds and qualifications of possible candidates after considering the function and needs of the Board. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee meets to discuss and consider the candidates' qualifications and then selects a nominee for recommendation to the Board.

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee will consider stockholder recommendations of director candidates for election to the Board by holders of our common stock. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee does not intend to alter the manner in which it evaluates candidates, including the minimum criteria set forth above, based on whether the candidate was recommended by a stockholder. Stockholders who wish to recommend individuals for consideration by the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee to become nominees for election to the Board by holders of our common stock at an annual meeting of stockholders may do so by delivering a written recommendation to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee at the following address: Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, c/o Immunovant, Inc., 320 West 37th Street, New York, New York 10018, Attn: Secretary, at least 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the mailing of our proxy statement for the last annual meeting of stockholders. Submissions must include, among other things, the full name of the proposed candidate, a description of the proposed candidate's business experience for at least the previous five years, complete biographical information, a description of the proposed candidate's qualifications as a director, and such other information as required by our amended and restated bylaws. Any such submission must be accompanied by the written consent of the proposed candidate to be named as a nominee and to serve as a director if elected.

Special Committee
-----------------

The Special Committee was formed on March 19, 2021 as our Board of Directors considers RSL's proposal of a potential transaction whereby RSL or its affiliate would acquire all of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock not currently held by RSL (the "Potential Transaction"). The Special Committee consists of Mr. Hughes and Mr. Migausky who are independent. The Special Committee was delegated the authority, duty and power:

* · to review and consider whether it would be appropriate and desirable for us to consider a Potential Transaction;
* · to identify, review and evaluate alternatives to the Potential Transaction that may be available to us, including remaining an independent company;
* · to review and evaluate, and, as appropriate, negotiate the price, structure, form, terms and conditions of the Potential Transaction or any alternatives and the form, terms and conditions of any definitive agreements in connection with the Potential Transaction or any alternatives;
* · to make recommendations to the Board relating to, and to communicate (including, but not limited to, communications with our stockholders, other investors, management, other directors and advisors and representatives) regarding a Potential Transaction or any alternative thereto;
* · to recommend to the Board what further action, if any, should be taken with respect to a Potential Transaction or any alternative thereto; and
* · to take all such other actions as the Special Committee determines necessary, appropriate or advisable in connection with any and all aspects of (including, but not limited to, process, proposals, offers and inquiries in connection with) a Potential Transaction or any alternatives.

* Reflects the grant of RSL RSUs outstanding under the RSL 2015 EIP that vest upon the satisfaction of both a "service" requirement and a "liquidity event" requirement. The service requirement applicable to the RSL RSUs is satisfied as follows: (i) 25% of the RSL RSUs satisfy the service requirement on the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date and (ii) the remaining 75% of the RSL RSUs satisfy the service requirement in 36 successive equal monthly installments thereafter, in each case, subject to Dr. Salzmann's continuous service through the applicable vesting date. The liquidity event requirement will be satisfied upon the first to occur of a "change in control" or "initial public offering" of RSL (as defined in the RSL 2015 EIP and the applicable award agreement) prior to the expiration date of the RSL RSUs, which is eight years from the grant date. If the liquidity event requirement is not satisfied before the expiration date, the RSL RSUs will be forfeited. The number of RSL RSUs reflected in the table above assumes full attainment of the liquidity event requirement. In the event Dr. Salzmann's continuous service is involuntarily terminated for any reason other than for "cause" within 12 months following the consummation of a "change in control," the RSL RSUs will become fully vested.

Options that are forfeited, cancelled or have expired are available for future grants.

2018 Equity Incentive Plan
--------------------------

In September 2018, ISL adopted its 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2018 Plan"), under which 3,667,997 shares of common stock were reserved for grant. In July 2019, the 2018 Plan was amended and restated to increase the number of shares of common stock reserved for grant to 4,768,396. Upon the closing of the Business Combination, we assumed all outstanding options, and, for accounting purposes, we are deemed to have assumed the 2018 Plan. The exchange of the stock options did not result in any incremental compensation expense, since there were no changes to the vesting terms of the awards. As of the effective date of the 2019 Plan, no further stock awards have been or will be made under 2018 Plan.

Director Compensation

* In May 2020, we issued to the director an option to purchase 37,000 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $19.01 per share. These options vest in eight equal quarterly installments, subject to the director's continuous service as of each vesting date. In March 2021, we issued to the director an option to purchase 23,300 shares of our common stock with an exercise price of $17.00 per share. These options vest one year after the date of grant, subject to each director's continuous service as of each vesting date. In May 2020, we granted to the director 24,700 RSUs, which vest in two equal annual installments on May 15, 2021 and May 15, 2022, subject to each director's continuous service as of each vesting date. In March 2021, we granted to the director 15,500 RSUs, which vest in their entirety one year after the date of grant, subject to the director's continuous service as of such vesting date. Each RSU represents the contingent right to receive one share of common stock. (5)

Director Compensation Policy
----------------------------

We have adopted a director compensation policy, pursuant to which our directors are eligible to receive cash compensation for service on our Board of Directors and committees of our Board of Directors. We also reimburse our directors for reasonable travel and out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with attending Board and committee meetings.

Directors who are also full-time officers or employees of Immunovant do not receive any additional compensation for serving as directors. Therefore, Dr. Salzmann, our Chief Executive Officer and one of our directors, does not receive any additional compensation for his service as a director. Dr. Salzmann's compensation as an executive officer is set forth above under "Executive Compensation." In addition, Dr. Venker has declined to receive any compensation during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2021 and 2022.

During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, each director (other than as noted above) received an annual cash retainer of $50,000 for serving on our Board of Directors. This amount remained the same for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022, except for Dr. Frank Torti, the chairperson of our Board of Directors, for whom this amount was increased to $85,000 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2022.

The chairperson and members of the three committees of our Board of Directors are entitled to the following additional annual cash retainers:

Table of Contents

| Board Committee | Chairperson Fee | Member Fee |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Audit Committee | $ 17,500 | $ 8,800 |
| Compensation Committee | 15,000 | 7,500 |
| Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee | 10,000 | 5,000 |

All annual cash compensation amounts are payable in equal quarterly installments in arrears, on the last day of each fiscal quarter for which the service occurred, pro-rated based on the days served in the applicable fiscal quarter.

A one-time cash retainer of $60,000 was paid in May 2021 to each of Mr. Hughes and Mr. Migausky as members of the Special Committee of the Board of Directors.

Each new director who joins our Board of Directors will receive an equity award with a value equal to $788,000 of our common stock under the 2019 Plan. Such equity award will be comprised of (i) 50% non-statutory stock options and (ii) 50% restricted stock unit award. The shares subject to these awards will vest on an annual basis over three years commencing on the grant date, subject to the director's continuous service with us on each applicable vesting date.

In the event of a change of control (as defined in the 2019 Plan), any unvested shares subject to an award may fully vest and become exercisable immediately prior to the effective date of such change of control, subject to the director's continuous service with us on the effective date of the change of control.

The exercise price per share of each stock option granted under the director compensation policy will be the closing price of our common stock as reported by The Nasdaq Global Select Market on the date of grant. Each stock option will have a term of ten years from the date of grant, subject to earlier termination in connection with a termination of the non-employee director's continuous service with us.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation
-----------------------------------------------------------

None of our directors who serve as a member of our Compensation Committee is, or has at any time during the past year been, one of our officers or employees. None of our executive officers currently serves, or in the past year has served, as a member of the board or compensation committee of any other entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our Board or Compensation Committee.

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions
----------------------------------------------------

The following is a summary of transactions since April 1, 2019, to which we have been a participant in which the amount involved exceeded or will exceed $120,000, and in which any of our directors, executive officers or holders of more than five percent of our capital stock, or any member of the immediate family of the foregoing persons, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest, other than compensation arrangements which are described in "Executive Compensation" and "Director Compensation."

Sponsor Shares
--------------

The Health Sciences Holdings, LLC, initially a holder of more than 5% of our capital stock (the "Sponsor"), purchased from HSAC an aggregate of 10,000,000 warrants (the "private warrants"), at $0.50 per private warrant (for a total purchase price of $5,000,000), with each warrant exercisable for one share of common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share simultaneously with the closing of HSAC's initial public offering in May 2019. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, all of the private warrants were canceled upon the closing of the Business Combination.

Sponsor Restricted Stock Agreement
----------------------------------

In accordance with that certain restricted stock agreement, dated September 29, 2019, by and between HSAC and the Sponsor, the Sponsor subjected 1,800,000 shares of its common stock to potential forfeiture, with 900,000 shares to vest and be released from potential forfeiture upon achievement of each of the First Earnout Milestone and the Second Earnout Milestone (each as defined below), respectively. On May 12 and September 17, 2020, we achieved the First Earnout Milestone and the Second Earnout Milestone, respectively, and, as a result, all of the 1,800,000 Sponsor Restricted Shares vested and are no longer subject to forfeiture.

Registration Rights
-------------------

We have entered into an amended and restated registration rights agreement which provides certain holders of our securities registration rights with respect to such securities. In May 2019, HSAC entered into a registration rights agreement with the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor was granted certain rights relating to the registration of securities of HSAC held by the Sponsor.

In September 2019, HSAC, the Sponsor and the Sellers entered into an amended and restated registration rights agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement"), which became effective as of the closing of the Business Combination. Under the Registration Rights Agreement, the Sponsor and the Sellers hold registration rights that obligate us to register for resale under the Securities Act all or any portion of the Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) held by the Sponsor and the Sellers. Each of the Sponsor, RSL and stockholders holding a majority-in-interest of all such Registrable Securities will be entitled to make a written demand for registration under the Securities Act of all or part of the their Registrable Securities, so long as such shares are not then restricted under the lock-up agreements described above. Subject to certain exceptions, if we propose to file a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to our securities, under the Registration Rights Agreement, we will give notice to the Sponsor and the Sellers as to the proposed filing and offer such stockholders an opportunity to register the resale of such number of their Registrable Securities as they request in writing, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, such stockholders will be entitled under the Registration Rights Agreement to request in writing that we register the resale of any or all of their Registrable Securities on Form S-3 or any other registration statement that may be available at such time.

Earnout Payments
----------------

The Sellers were entitled to receive up to an aggregate of 20,000,000 additional shares of our common stock (the "Earnout Shares"), after the closing of the Business Combination, if the volume-weighted average price of our shares equals or exceeds the following prices for any 20 trading days within any 30 trading-day period (the "Trading Period") following December 18, 2019, the date of the closing of the Business Combination:

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

Table of Contents
-----------------

* (i) during any Trading Period prior to March 31, 2023, 10,000,000 Earnout Shares upon the achievement of a volume-weighted average price of at least $17.50 per share (the "First Earnout Milestone"); and
* (ii) during any Trading Period prior to March 31, 2025, 10,000,000 Earnout Shares upon the achievement of a volume-weighted average price of at least $31.50 per share (the "Second Earnout Milestone").

On May 12 and September 17, 2020, we achieved the First Earnout Milestone and the Second Earnout Milestone, respectively. Accordingly, we issued all of the 20,000,000 Earnout Shares to the Sellers (including 17,547,938 Earnout Shares issued to RSL) during the year ended March 31, 2021.

ISL Financing Transactions
--------------------------

On August 1, 2019, the RTW Master Fund, Ltd. and RTW Innovation Master Fund, Ltd., (the "RTW Entities"), entities controlled by officers and directors of HSAC, made a $25.0 million investment in ISL in exchange for two promissory notes or the Promissory Notes. On September 26, 2019, $2.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Promissory Notes issued to the RTW Entities was repaid, and the accrued interest on such principal amount was forgiven. The remaining aggregate principal amount of the Promissory Notes automatically converted immediately prior to the consummation of the Business Combination into shares of ISL exchangeable for an aggregate of 2,250,000 shares of our common stock upon the closing of the Business Combination. All interest under the Promissory Notes was waived and cancelled immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination.

On June 11, 2019, ISL issued an interest-free promissory note to RSL in the amount of $5.0 million, which was due and payable at the earlier of December 12, 2019 or upon demand by RSL. Subsequently, on August 7, 2019, ISL cancelled this note and entered into a promissory note with RSL in the amount of $5.0 million under the same terms as the Promissory Notes. On September 26, 2019, ISL repaid $2.5 million of the principal amount of the Promissory Note issued to RSL, and the accrued interest on such amount was forgiven. The remaining aggregate principal amount of the Promissory Note issued to RSL automatically converted immediately prior to the consummation of the Business Combination into shares of ISL exchangeable for an aggregate of 250,000 shares of our common stock upon the closing of the Business Combination. All interest under this Promissory Note was waived and cancelled immediately prior to the closing of the Business Combination.

In July 2019, ISG issued a promissory note to RSL in the amount of $2.9 million with a 180-day term. The promissory note does not have a stated interest rate and is payable on demand upon the expiration of the term. In May 2020, the promissory note was fully repaid.

Affiliate Services Agreements
-----------------------------

ISL has entered into services agreements with each of RSI and RSG, wholly owned subsidiaries of our controlling stockholder RSL, each as further described below. Pursuant to these services agreements, for each of the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, ISL incurred expenses of $1.3 million, inclusive of the mark-up under these agreements.

We expect that our reliance on RSI will decrease over time as we and our subsidiaries continue to hire the necessary personnel to manage the development and potential commercialization of IMVT-1401 or any future product candidates.

Under the terms of the RSI Services Agreement, we are obligated to pay or reimburse RSI for the costs we, or third parties acting on our behalf, incur in providing services to us.

In addition, ISL, IMVT Corporation and ISG have agreed to indemnify RSI and its affiliates and their respective officers, employees and directors against all losses arising out of, due to or in connection with the receipt of services under the RSI Services Agreement, subject to certain limitations set forth in the RSI Services Agreement. Such indemnification obligations will not exceed the payments made by ISL, by IMVT Corporation and by ISG under the RSI Services Agreement for the specific service that allegedly caused or was related to the losses during the period in which such alleged losses were incurred. The term of the RSI Services Agreement will continue until terminated upon 90 days' written notice by RSI or by either IMVT Corporation or ISG with respect to the services either such party receives thereunder.

Roivant Sciences GmbH Services Agreement
----------------------------------------

Effective as of August 20, 2018, ISG entered into a services agreement with RSG, a wholly owned subsidiary of RSL (the "RSG Services Agreement"), pursuant to which RSG provides ISG with various services, including, but not limited to, services related to development, administrative and financial activities. We expect that reliance on RSG by ISG will decrease over time as ISG hires the necessary personnel to manage the development and potential commercialization of IMVT-1401 or any future product candidates.

Under the terms of the RSG Services Agreement, ISG is obligated to pay or reimburse RSG for the costs it, or third parties acting on its behalf, incur(s) in providing services to ISL. In addition, ISG is obligated to pay to RSG a pre-determined mark-up on costs incurred by it in connection with any general and administrative and support services as well as research and development services.

Such indemnification obligations will not exceed the payments made by ISG under the RSG Services Agreement for the specific service that allegedly caused or was related to the losses during the period in which such alleged losses were incurred. The term of the RSG Services Agreement will continue until terminated by RSG or ISG upon 90 days' written notice.

RSL Information Sharing and Cooperation Agreement
-------------------------------------------------

In December 2018, ISL entered into an amended and restated information sharing and cooperation agreement (the "Cooperation Agreement"), with RSL. The Cooperation Agreement, among other things: (1) obligates ISL to deliver to RSL periodic financial statements and other information upon reasonable request and to comply with other specified financial reporting requirements; (2) requires ISL to supply certain material information to RSL to assist it in preparing any future SEC filings; and (3) requires ISL to implement and observe certain policies and procedures related to applicable laws and regulations.

No amounts have been paid or received under this agreement; however, ISL believes this agreement is material to our business and operations.

Table of Contents
-----------------

Subject to specified exceptions, the Cooperation Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (1) the mutual written consent of the parties or (2) the later of when RSL is no longer (a) required by GAAP to consolidate our results of operations and financial position, account for its investment in ISL under the equity method of accounting or, by any rule of the SEC, include our separate financial statements in any filings it may make with the SEC and (b) has the right to elect directors constituting a majority of the Board.

RSI Subleases
-------------

In June 2020, we entered into two sublease agreements with RSI, for two floors of the building we currently occupy as our headquarters in New York. The subleases will expire on February 27, 2024 and April 29, 2024, respectively, and have scheduled rent increases each year. These leases are classified as operating leases. Operating lease ROU assets of $4.2 million and lease liabilities of $4.2 million, were recognized based on the present value of remaining fixed lease payments over the expected lease term using an incremental borrowing rate of 3.9%. During the year ended March 31, 2021, we paid $0.9 million in cash related to contractual rent obligations under these sublease agreements. See Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 11 - Leases for a discussion of the subleases we entered into with RSI.

Employment Arrangements
-----------------------

Prior to the Business Combination, each of our executive officers was employed by our wholly owned subsidiary, IMVT Corporation (formerly Immunovant, Inc.), and provides services to ISL pursuant to an inter-company services agreement between ISL and IMVT Corporation and ISG. Each of our executive officers has an employment agreement with us that sets forth the initial terms and conditions of employment.

Indemnification Agreements
--------------------------

We entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers. These indemnification agreements provide the directors and executive officers with contractual rights to indemnification and expense advancement.

Related Person Transaction Policy
---------------------------------

We have adopted a related person transaction policy that sets forth our procedures for the identification, review, consideration and approval or ratification of related person transactions. A related person transaction is a transaction, arrangement or relationship, or any series of similar transactions, arrangements or relationships, in which we and any related person are, were or will be participants in which the amount involved exceeds $120,000. Transactions involving compensation for services provided to us as an employee or director are not covered by this policy. A related person is any executive officer, director or beneficial owner of more than 5% of any class of our voting securities, including RSL, and any of their respective immediate family members and any entity owned or controlled by such persons.

Under the policy, if a transaction has been identified as a related person transaction, including any transaction that was not a related person transaction when originally consummated or any transaction that was not initially identified as a related person transaction prior to consummation, our management must present information regarding the related person transaction to our Audit Committee, or, if Audit Committee approval would be inappropriate, to another independent body of the Board, for review, consideration and approval or ratification. The presentation must include a description of, among other things, the material facts, the interests, direct and indirect, of the related persons, the benefits to us of the transaction and whether the transaction is on terms that are comparable to the terms available to or from, as the case may be, an unrelated third party or to or from employees generally. Under the policy, we will collect information that we deem reasonably necessary from each director, executive officer and, to the extent feasible, significant stockholder to enable us to identify any existing or potential related-person transactions and to effectuate the terms of the policy. In addition, under the Code of Conduct our employees and directors will have an affirmative responsibility to disclose any transaction or relationship that reasonably could be expected to give rise to a conflict of interest. In considering related person transactions, the Audit Committee, or other independent body of the Board, will take into account the relevant available facts and circumstances including, but not limited to:

* · the risks, costs and benefits to us;
* · the impact on a director's independence in the event that the related person is a director, immediate family member of a director or an entity with which a director is affiliated;
* · the availability of other sources for comparable services or products; and
* · the terms available to or from, as the case may be, unrelated third parties or to or from employees generally.

Table of Contents
-----------------

The policy requires that, in determining whether to approve, ratify or reject a related person transaction, the Audit Committee, or other independent body of the Board, must consider, in light of known circumstances, whether the transaction is in, or is not inconsistent with, our best interests and those of our stockholders, as the Audit Committee, or other independent body of the Board, determines in the good faith exercise of its discretion.

Director Independence and Controlled Company Exemption
------------------------------------------------------

We are a "controlled company" within the meaning of the listing rules of the Nasdaq. We will remain a "controlled company" so long as either more than 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by RSL, or the directors elected by RSL as holder of the Series A Preferred Stock control all matters presented to its Board for a vote. As such, we intend to avail ourselves of the controlled company exemptions under the Nasdaq listing rules. As a controlled company, we will not be required to have a majority of our Board comprised of "independent directors," as defined under the Nasdaq listing rules, or to have a Compensation Committee or a Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee composed entirely of independent directors. Accordingly, you may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of Nasdaq. We may continue to rely on these exemptions so long as we are allowed to as a "controlled company."

The "controlled company" exemption does not modify the independence requirements for the Audit Committee, and we comply with the requirements of Rule 10A3 of the Exchange Act, and the Nasdaq listing rules, which rules require that our Audit Committee be composed of at least three members.

The Board has undertaken a review of the independence of the directors and considered whether any director has a material relationship with us that could compromise his ability to exercise independent judgment in carrying out his or her responsibilities. As a result of this review, the Board has determined that the following three directors are independent directors within the meaning of applicable rules and regulations of the SEC and Nasdaq listing rules: Messrs. Hughes and Migausky and Dr. Pande. Dr. Salzmann is not independent due to his position as Chief Executive Officer of Immunovant, and Dr. Torti, Dr. Venker and Mr. Fromkin are not independent due to their positions with RSI.

Please see " Item 10 - Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance " for information regarding our Audit Committee.

Item 14. Principal Accountant Fees and Services
-----------------------------------------------

In connection with the closing of the Business Combination on December 18, 2019, WithumSmith+Brown, PC ("Withum"), was dismissed as our independent registered accounting firm. This decision was approved by the Board. In connection with the closing of the Business Combination on December 18, 2019, the Board approved the appointment of Ernst & Young LLP as our independent registered accounting firm. Ernst & Young LLP served as the independent registered accounting firm for ISL.

Ernst & Young LLP has audited the financial statements of ISL since 2018. ISL was determined to be the accounting acquirer in the Business Combination resulting in a change to the combined company's fiscal year to March 31, effective as of the closing of the Business Combination. The fees of Ernst & Young LLP presented below are not representative of the fees to be billed by Ernst & Young LLP for Immunovant as a public company, but are presented solely to provide our stockholders with a basis to understand our historical relationship with Ernst & Young LLP.

The following tables present the aggregate fees billed by Ernst & Young LLP and Withum to us (including ISL, in the case of Ernst & Young LLP) for the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.

Pre-Approval Policies and Procedures
------------------------------------

The Audit Committee has adopted a policy and procedures for the pre-approval of audit and non-audit services rendered by Immunovant's independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP. The policy generally pre-approves specified services in the defined categories of audit services, audit-related services and tax services up to specified amounts. Pre-approval may also be given as part of the Audit Committee's approval of the scope of the engagement of the independent auditor or on an individual, explicit, case-by-case basis before the independent auditor is engaged to provide each service. The pre-approval of services may be delegated to one or more of the Audit Committee's members, but the decision must be reported to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting. The Audit Committee has determined that the rendering of services other than audit services by Ernst & Young LLP is compatible with maintaining the principal accountant's independence.
