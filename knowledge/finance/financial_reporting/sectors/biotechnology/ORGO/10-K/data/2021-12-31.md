## Our Business Strategy

We believe the following strategies will play a critical role in our future growth:

- · Drive Penetration in the Fast-Growing Advanced Wound Care Market. We intend to leverage our comprehensive product portfolio and relationships with key constituents to deepen our presence in the Advanced Wound Care market. We believe the breadth and flexibility of the portfolio we now offer allow us to address a wide variety of wound types (chronic & acute), sizes, and reimbursement levels, offering significant new opportunities for growth. Furthermore, we believe our expanded product portfolio is enhancing the ability of our sales representatives to reach and penetrate customer accounts, contributing to strong growth over time. Additionally, we believe there is significant room for expansion of the Advanced Wound Care market as a whole and our wound biologics product category in particular as more physicians and payers are educated about the benefits of regenerative medicine technologies versus traditional therapies. We continue to invest to support physician and payer education as well as preclinical and clinical trials, real-world evidence, and other research to confirm the benefits of our products. We will continue to seek expanded payer coverage for all of our products, particularly PuraPly AM, Novachor, NuShield and Affinity, for which we do not yet have the broad commercial payer coverage enjoyed by Apligraf and Dermagraft.
- · Continued Expansion into Surgical & Sports Medicine Market. We entered the Surgical & Sports Medicine market with the acquisition of NuTech Medical and its established and leading presence in placental-based products in 2017. We plan to continue to accelerate penetration into this market with our placental-based and collagen biomaterial products by leveraging our established commercial and

operational infrastructure and building out our direct sales force to supplement our independent sales agencies. We also plan to continue to take advantage of significant opportunities to cross-sell within our established customer bases in both the Advanced Wound Care and Surgical & Sports Medicine markets. We believe that the Surgical & Sports Medicine market presents a strong near-term opportunity with respect to our current product portfolio as well as a significant long-term opportunity with respect to chronic inflammatory and degenerative conditions. Given our experience in the Advanced Wound Care market and regenerative medicine in general, we believe we are well positioned to capture this opportunity.

- · Launch Robust Pipeline of Products and Drive Innovation with a Proven Research and Development Platform. We have a robust pipeline of products in both the Advanced Wound Care and Surgical & Sports Medicine markets that we expect to launch in the near term. We expect these products will deepen our portfolios and allow us to address additional clinical applications. In addition, we anticipate our ongoing efforts to complete clinical studies and publish research regarding our products will further enhance physician and payer receptiveness to our products over time. Our proven research and development capabilities and established technology platforms also support a robust and adaptable product pipeline for future applications.
- · Continue to Expand Sales Force and Increase Sales Productivity and Geographic Reach. We plan to continue to expand the reach and penetration of our products by growing our sales organization to serve the Advanced Wound Care and Surgical & Sports Medicine markets. This expansion should allow us to achieve more focused and effective sales coverage for specific market categories, broaden our geographic footprint, and leverage our expanding relationships with large hospital systems and GPOs. We also plan to increase our focus on sales outside of the United States, including the European Union and the Middle East. Currently, substantially all of our sales are in the United States.
- · Supplement Organic Growth Through Selective Acquisitions. We have demonstrated our ability to successfully identify and integrate assets that complement our strategy through the acquisitions of Dermagraft and TransCyte from Shire and our placental-based products from NuTech Medical. We believe TransCyte has the ability to address a $200 million burn market, which includes 450,000 burns that require medical attention and 40,000 burns that require hospitalization annually in the United States. We continue to evaluate tuck-in acquisitions which complement our existing portfolios in both the Advanced Wound Care and Surgical & Sports Medicine markets and will leverage our established commercial and manufacturing infrastructure.

## Industry Overview

We focus our efforts on medical conditions that involve difficult to heal wounds and musculoskeletal injuries. Healing difficulties may arise from a variety of causes and in various types of tissue and anatomic areas. Impaired healing is commonly associated with an inability to move beyond the inflammatory stages of healing, resulting in a chronic wound or injury, an ongoing inflammatory cycle, and an inability to achieve normal tissue healing. Biofilm and other infectious conditions also play a key role in disrupting wound healing processes. Regenerative medicine is a collection of technologies aimed at generating tissue as close as possible to native or natural tissue, to replace damaged tissue and to fill or replace defects. Demand for these technologies is increasing as physician understanding of the underlying wound healing processes grows and as demographic and population health trends result in the increased prevalence of systemic comorbidities that contribute to healing problems throughout the body.

Our products use regenerative medicine technologies to provide solutions in the Advanced Wound Care (Chronic Wound) and Surgical (Acute Wound) & Sports Medicine markets. Based on industry reports and management estimates, we believe that our addressable Advanced Wound Care and Surgical & Sports Medicine markets totaled approximately $24 billion in 2021, which included an estimated $10 billion addressable market for Advanced Wound Care and an estimated $14 billion for Surgical & Sports Medicine. Within the Advanced

## Table of Contents

Wound Care market in 2021, 49% of treatments used advanced wound dressings, 18% used biologics, 21% used external wound healing devices, and 13% consisted of more traditional wound care dressings. The skin substitute market, within biologics, is expected to grow from $1.1 billion in 2021 to $2 billion in 2026. Within the Surgical & Sports Medicine market, the surgical/acute wound sub-market accounts for $9.1 billion, chronic inflammatory and degenerative condition sub-market accounts for approximately $3.8 billion and the tendon and ligamentinjuries sub-market accounts for approximately $1.0 billion in 2015.

Key drivers of growth in these two markets include:

- · favorable global demographics and aging population;
- · greater incidence of comorbidities that contribute to impaired healing, such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease and smoking; and
- · increasing acceptance of advanced technologies to treat complex wounds and musculoskeletal injuries.

## Advanced Wound Care Market

Wounds represent a large and growing burden on the public health as well as a significant cost to the health care system. Wounds are divided into two primary types, chronic and acute. It is estimated that approximately 80 million patients suffer from chronic and acute wounds globally each year, excluding surgical incisions. Chronic wounds account for most of the expenses due to their complexity and length of treatment.

## Chronic Wounds

Chronic wounds are wounds that have not appropriately closed after four weeks of treatment with traditional treatment such as dressings. Chronic wounds include:

- · VLUs: wounds that occur in the leg veins when blood does not circulate properly to the heart.
- · DFUs: open sores or wounds that occur in patients with diabetes and are commonly located on the bottom of the foot.
- · Pressure Ulcers: localized injuries to the skin and/or underlying tissues as a result of pressure or pressure in combination with shear.
- · Surgical Wounds: acute wounds caused by surgical incisions that become chronic wounds if they do not heal properly.

While the underlying etiology of these chronic wounds is different, at a cellular level many of the problems that result in failed healing are the same. These include uncontrolled inflammatory processes, shortages of cell types and growth factors secreted by cells that are critical to healing, and that result in disrupted cell signaling pathways.

## Relative Prevalence of Wounds

Our customers in outpatient wound care facilities are faced with a wide variety of types of wounds with different anatomical locations and underlying causes. Based on a retrospective cohort study of data from wound care centers from June 2008 and June 2012, the distribution of wound types in hospital outpatient wound care centers is detailed below:

## Distribution of Wound Types*

Due to the breadth of our wound care portfolio, our products are able to address both chronic and acute wounds across all of these wound types.

## Our Solution

The wound care market includes traditional dressings such as bandages, gauzes and ointments and advanced wound care products such as mechanical devices, advanced dressings and biologics. These advanced wound care products target chronic and acute wounds not adequately addressed by traditional therapies. Our products are primarily classified as skin substitutes, which fall within the biologics category of the Advanced Wound Care market.

According to Grand View Research, the Global Advanced Wound Care market was estimated to be approximately $10 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 4% through 2028. This market consists of several product categories including advanced wound dressings, external wound healing devices such as negative pressure wound therapy, or NPWT, biologics such as skin substitute and growth factors and other traditional wound dressings. The approximate breakdown for these product categories in 2021 is set forth below.

## Advanced Wound Care Market

Wound biologics represents one of the smallest segments of the Advanced Wound Care market but is the fastest growing and has seen the highest level of innovation. According to BCC, the worldwide wound biologics market, which includes skin substitutes and growth factors, was estimated to be approximately $1.7 billion in 2021, of which skin substitute products are estimated to represent approximately 62%. Skin substitutes, bioengineered or biologic grafts that cover skin defects and support healing, are one of the fastest-growing categories of the Advanced Wound Care market. The skin substitute market, within biologics, is expected to grow from $1.1 billion in 2021 to $2 billion in 2026. Going forward, the skin substitute market is projected to continue to grow as patients with hard-to-heal wounds transition from other therapies to skin substitute treatment.

We expect this market to continue to grow at a rapid rate as physicians are educated about the use of these products and understand the benefits as compared to other currently marketed products, payers incentivize doctors to use more cost effective treatments, patients demand more effective treatment solutions and advanced wound care becomes more common outside of the United States. We also believe that adoption of these products will increase as clinical evidence supporting the benefits of skin substitutes over traditional therapies continues to grow. Skin substitutes have demonstrated improved chronic and acute wound healing rates at a lower overall cost than the current standard of care. In a matched cohort study we commissioned, Medicare treatment costs for DFUs treated with Apligraf were $5,253 ( p =0.49) lower per patient than the standard of care and for DFUs treated with Dermagraft, these costs were $6,991 ( p =0.84) lower per patient than the standard of care. See Rice et al. "Economic outcomes among Medicare patients receiving bioengineered cellular technologies for treatment of diabetic foot ulcers." J Med Econ. 2015;18(8):586-95.

Our products compete with other skin substitutes as well as other advanced wound care products such as NPWT and growth factors. Due to its market position as a skin substitute with antimicrobial properties appropriate for the treatment of wounds with biofilm or otherwise at high risk of infection, our PuraPly AM product also competes with antimicrobial dressings. Antimicrobial wound products have historically represented a more than $1 billion annual market. We are a market leader in the antimicrobial skin substitute market and have supported the expansion of that market with our comprehensive marketing and educational campaigns.

Finally, the skin substitute market remains substantially underpenetrated. According to BioMed GPS, over 7.9 million wounds globally, 3.7 million in the United States, require medical care and are classified as difficult to heal wounds where traditional therapies are unlikely to succeed. Market growth will be propelled by the aging population and rise of diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease-all associated with poor vascularity increasing the susceptibility of chronic, hard-to-heal wounds. Despite the vast need and proven benefits of advanced wound care products in general to include skin substitutes, market penetration remains low in relation to the size of the total addressable market. Our internal estimates indicate that if the potentially addressable market were completely penetrated today, annual skin substitute revenue in the United States alone could exceed $9 billion.

We believe that we are well positioned in the skin substitute market as adoption continues to increase. According to BioMed GPS, we are a leading skin substitute company in the United States, and we have an experienced and established sales force with deep relationships with clinicians, wound care centers and hospitals. We also have a diverse array of products to address the different varieties of wounds throughout the wound healing process.

## Surgical & Sports Medicine Market

An estimated 313 million surgical procedures are performed worldwide annually. An analysis of Medicare beneficiaries reveals that surgical wound care is associated with the highest wound care expenses, followed by DFUs. Trauma wounds, including burns, are included in the surgical/acute wound area. It is estimated that traumatic injury is responsible for more than 5 million deaths worldwide per year. Sports Medicine has displayed considerable growth as compared to other healthcare fields as a result of the rise in incidence of sports-associated injuries along with increase in awareness among people regarding physical fitness. We estimate the immediate addressable Surgical & Sports Medicine market for our products to be approximately $14 billion with a CAGR of approximately 6% through 2028.

## Surgical/Acute Wounds

A surgical and/or acute wound is an injury that causes a rapid break in the skin and sometimes the underlying tissue. Acute wounds can be traumatic wounds, such as abrasions, lacerations, penetrating injuries and burns, or surgical wounds (grafts, dehiscences, necrotizing soft tissue infections) from surgical incisions. In contrast to chronic wounds, which would normally heal but stall due to biologic factors, acute wounds can be so severe that they overwhelm the body's normal healing capacity. Biofilm and other infectious conditions, particularly in acute wounds with a high risk of infection such as open fractures, may also pose challenges to the healing of acute wounds. According to BCC Market Research, in the U.S. alone more than 150,000 deaths stem from traumatic injuries and there are more than 3 million nonfatal injuries per year. An estimated 180,000 deaths every year are caused by burns, and nonfatal burn injuries are a leading cause of morbidity. According to the American Burn Association, approximately 450,000 Americans sustain serious burn injuries every year, and more than 40,000 require hospitalization and advanced medical care.

## Sports Medicine

While our portfolio of products has applicability across a wide variety of clinical specialties and wound types in the advanced wound care and surgical wound care market, our immediate focus in Sports Medicine is in the regenerative orthobiologics sub-market. Orthobiologics are substances that orthopedic surgeons use to help injuries to bones, tendons and ligaments heal more quickly. Orthobiologic products are used to treat people with long-term disabling musculoskeletal disorders and injuries. The majority of musculoskeletal injuries occur due to recreational and sports activities. The patient demographics include both younger populations and those involved in professional sports, as well as the elderly population, usually requiring treatment for degenerative disorders and chronic diseases. The market has seen an increase in surgical volumes in part due to a higher incidence of comorbidities and chronic inflammatory and degenerative conditions, such as OA and tendonitis. The growing and aging population affected with osteoarthritis (OA) that is still looking to remain active will continue to seek non-surgical or minimally invasive alternatives. The prevalence of knee OA has been increasing over the past several decades in the U.S., mirroring the aging population and the growing obesity epidemic.

## Tendon and Ligament Injuries

Tendon and ligament injuries are common orthopedic conditions in an active and aging population. There are approximately 250,000 rotator cuff repairs performed in the United States annually. Additionally, in 2015, there were approximately 40,000 outpatient Achilles tendon repairs in the United States. Re-rupture and reoperation continue to be a significant source of concern withnon-operative management, occurring in 4.8% of Achilles tendon repair cases and as many as 25% or more rotator cuff repair cases. Comorbidities such as diabetes and obesity, as well as age, are correlated with a higher risk of failed healing and re-rupture. Regenerative tissue scaffolds may be used to support the healing of tendons, ligaments and other soft tissues. According to Technavio, the annual regenerative tissue scaffold market is estimated to exceed $1 billion.

## Chronic Inflammatory and Degenerative Conditions (Future Pipeline Opportunity)

Chronic inflammatory and degenerative orthopedic conditions are increasingly prevalent, driven in part by an aging demographic and higher levels of comorbidities such as diabetes and obesity. OA is the most common chronic condition of the joints, affecting approximately 27 million individuals in the United States. OA can affect multiple joints in the body, with arthritis of the knee being the most commonly treated. One in two adults will develop symptoms of knee OA during their lives. Other chronic inflammatory conditions such as Achilles and rotator cuff tendinosis and plantar fasciitis are also increasingly common. Similar to many of the other conditions that we seek to address, chronic inflammatory and degenerative orthopedic conditions are often correlated with smoking, obesity and diabetes, among other factors. Collectively, these and other related conditions were treated with an estimated 9 million injections in 2016, including steroids and hyaluronic acid, or HA. According to Grand View Research, the global chronic inflammatory and degenerative orthopedic market (Viscosupplementation Market) exceeded $3.8 billion in 2020.

## Our Solution

We believe our multiple regenerative technology platforms will allow us to build a broad portfolio covering the full range of needs in the Surgical & Sports Medicine market. In the short term, our focus will be on providing clinicians with wound covering and solutions to support soft tissue healing solutions with our placental-based technologies for open acute wounds and tendon and ligament surgical repair procedures. In the long-term, we plan to deepen our focus and provide solutions for chronic inflammatory and degenerative conditions, and in particular, OA as illustrated by our current Phase III Clinical Trial for ReNu. We intend to address patient needs with our portfolio in the inpatient hospital, ASC and clinic settings. We estimate the immediate addressable Surgical & Sports Medicine market for our products to be approximately $14 billion respectively with a CAGR of approximately 6% through 2028.

For surgical/acute wounds, as skin substitutes continue to gain market adoption based on their demonstrated efficacy in improving healing rates with lower overall costs for these comprised healing situations, we believe we

## Table of Contents

are well positioned with our comprehensive portfolio of technologies. Our placental-based technologies (Affinity, Novachor, NuShield) and skin substitute with antimicrobial properties (PuraPly AM) are highly differentiated both in composition along with their level of clinical utility. These product attributes coupled with our current market-leading position and high level of organizational competency give us the confidence that we have the ability to capture a high percent share of this growing market.

In tendon and ligament repair, conventional surgical approaches rely on mechanical fixation to temporarily approximate damaged tissues, assuming that the natural healing process will then result in a permanent repair. Patients with impaired healing may be unable to generate the necessary tissue structures, resulting in unacceptable failure rates over time. As additional clinical evidence and technology adoption is gained with our placental-based technologies, we believe we are well positioned with our current offering (NuShield as a surgical barrier) and our pipeline of endogenous products in this area.

OA and other degenerative conditions, as well as soft tissue injuries such as tendinosis and fasciitis, are currently treated by injection with steroids or HA. However, steroids offer pain relief for only a limited period and have been shown to further degrade some types of tissues over time, worsening the underlying condition. The evidence of HA's efficacy has been questioned, and it is clear that a significant percentage of patients do not respond to HA treatment. Patients who fail these less invasive therapies have limited options and may require surgical intervention, including total joint replacement.

Orthobiologics have been shown to be an effective alternative to traditional treatments. Due to their anti-inflammatory andpro-healing effects, they go beyond mechanical intervention to support the healing process in the damaged tissue and often result in faster healing times and shorter hospital stays. The orthobiologics market includes bone morphogenetic protein, viscosupplementation with HA, synthetic bone graft substitutes and stem cell therapy, in addition to DBM and allograft. Our current product pipeline includes Sports Medicine solutions based on placental-based technologies (ReNu). There is a rapidly growing body of clinical and scientific evidence indicating the potential of these products, particularly orthobiologics, in surgical applications, resulting in increased adoption of these products.

## Our Products

## Advanced Wound Care

In the Advanced Wound Care (Chronic Wound) market, we focus on the development and commercialization of a broad portfolio of cellular and acellular wound care offerings that treat patients from the earliest indication of impaired healing to wound closure. Our suite of products helps treat a wide range of chronic wounds such as VLUs, DFUs, and pressure ulcers.

The breadth and depth of our portfolio allow physicians to tailor solutions to meet the needs of individual wound care patients. Wounds of all types normally progress through predictable phases of healing, starting with inflammation, progressing to cell proliferation and finally remodeling to form normal skin. Wounds may stall during this process, typically in the inflammatory phase, for a variety of reasons. These reasons include biofilm or infection, uncontrolled inflammatory processes, shortages of cell types and growth factors secreted by cells that are critical to healing and disrupted cell signaling pathways.

It is increasingly recognized that addressing biofilm is an important step in healing any wound. Biofilm is generated by densely packed microbial communities that are attached to the wound surface and enclosed in a matrix of self-produced extracellular polymeric substance, or EPS. Biofilm is present in at least 78% of chronic wounds and can inhibit the healing of all wound types. We engage with the physician at the earliest indication of impaired healing with our PuraPly AM product, which helps control biofilm as an antimicrobial barrier via the broad-spectrum antimicrobial PHMB. If reduction of biofilm and control of the excessive inflammatory response is sufficient to result in healing, as is often the case, PuraPly AM may be the only product required to achieve

wound closure. If underlying healing issues persist, we offer an array of bioactive products and placental-based wound coverings tailored for a wide variety of wound sizes and types.

Our advanced wound care products are used in wound clinics that are located in an outpatient hospital setting as well as in physician offices and ASCs. The table below summarizes our comprehensive advanced wound care product suite:

## Affinity & Novachor

Affinity & Novachor are fresh, amnion & chorion allograft wound coverings for application in the care of chronic and acute wounds. We believe both products are one of only a few placental tissue products containing

## Table of Contents

viable amniotic cells, and are unique in that they undergo our proprietary AlloFresh process that hypothermically stores the products in their fresh state, never dried or frozen, which retains their native benefits and structure. Regulated as a human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based product, or HCT/P, under Section 361 of the PHSA, these products are referred to as Section 361 HCT/Ps, or simply 361 HCT/Ps. Affinity was launched in 2014 by NuTech Medical and acquired by us in 2017. Novachor was recently launched in December 2021.

## Apligraf

Apligraf is a bioengineered bi-layered skin substitute that is the only product that has, to date, received PMA approval for the treatment of both VLUs and DFUs. Launched in 1998, Apligraf drives faster healing and more complete wound closure through its tissue engineered structure, which includes an outer layer of protective skin cells (human epidermal keratinocytes), and an inner layer of cells (human dermal fibroblasts) contained within a collagen matrix. Apligraf is the leading skin substitute product for the treatment of VLUs, and its effectiveness has been established based on an extensive clinical history with approximately 980,000 units shipped. We believe Apligraf is also the first and only wound-healing therapy to demonstrate in a randomized controlled trial, or RCT, a significant change in patients' VLU wound tissue, showing a shift from a non-healing gene profile to a healing profile. Apligraf plays an active role in healing by providing the wound with living human skin cells, growth factors and other proteins produced by the cells, and a collagen matrix.

## Dermagraft

Dermagraft is a dermal substitute grown from human dermal fibroblasts and has received PMA approval for the treatment of DFUs. Launched in 2001 by Smith & Nephew and acquired by us in 2014, this product helps to restore the compromised wound bed to facilitate healing. The living cells in Dermagraft produce many of the same proteins and growth factors that support the healing response in healthy skin. In addition to an FDA-monitored RCT demonstrating its superiority to conventional therapy in the healing of DFUs, studies based on real-world electronic health records and Medicare data have demonstrated its superior clinical efficacy and value as compared to competitive wound care products and conventional therapy. Dermagraft can be applied weekly (up to eight times) over a twelve-week period and does not need to be removed from the wound during this period because it contains a temporary mesh fabric that is dissolvable and becomes part of the body's own healing processes. As part of our long-term plan to consolidate manufacturing operations in Massachusetts, manufacturing of Dermagraft was suspended in the fourth quarter of 2021 and sales of Dermagraft will be suspended in the second quarter of 2022. We currently plan to transition our Dermagraft manufacturing to our Massachusetts-based manufacturing facilities, which we expect will result in substantial long-term cost savings. In the period when Dermagraft is not available (possibly for a few years), we expect that customers will be willing to substitute Apligraf for Dermagraft and that the suspension of Dermagraft sales will not have a material impact on our net revenue.

## NuShield

NuShield is a dehydrated placental tissue wound covering and surgical barrier that is topically or surgically applied to the target tissue to support native healing. Regulated as a 361 HCT/P, NuShield is processed using our proprietary LayerLoc process, which preserves the native structure of the amnion and chorion membranes, including the intermediate or spongy layer, and their native structural and regulatory proteins. NuShield is available in multiple sizes, can be used as a wound covering to help support native healing of chronic and acute wounds of many sizes, and can be stored at room temperature with a five-year shelf life. NuShield was launched in 2010 by NuTech Medical and acquired by us in 2017.

## PuraPly Antimicrobial

PuraPly Antimicrobial, or PuraPly AM, was developed to address the challenges posed by bioburden and excessive inflammation in the wound. Functioning as an antimicrobial barrier skin substitute, PuraPly AM is a purified native porcine type I collagen matrix embedded with polyhexamethylene biguanide, or PHMB, a

localized broad-spectrum antimicrobial. PuraPly AM was launched in 2016 and has received 510(k) clearance for the management of multiple wound types, including partial and full-thickness wounds, pressure ulcers, venous ulcers, diabetic ulcers, chronic vascular ulcers, tunneled/undermined wounds, surgical wounds, trauma wounds, draining wounds, and first- and second-degree burns. The combination of PHMB with a native collagen matrix helps manage bioburden while supporting healing across a wide variety of wound types, regardless of severity or duration. Line extensions include PuraPly XT, which contains additional layers of collagen matrix and a higher level of PHMB. Extra-fenestrated (EF) versions of the products allow for added conformability and fluid drainage. We also developed and received 510(k) clearance for PuraPly without PHMB, which we refer to as "PuraPly," for those patients who do not require an antimicrobial agent.

## Surgical & Sports Medicine

In the Surgical & Sports Medicine market, we focus on the development and commercialization of products that support the healing of surgical/acute wounds, and musculoskeletal injuries including chronic degenerative conditions such as OA and tendonitis. Our products in this market are used predominantly in the inpatient and outpatient hospital and ASC settings.

## NuShield, Affinity, Novachor, PuraPly AM and PuraForce

We market our NuShield product for surgical and orthopedic applications. NuShield may be used as a surgical barrier or as anon-lay or wrap barrier to support soft tissue repairs. When used as a barrier membrane, the native biological characteristics of this placental tissue may help support the healing of soft tissue defects, particularly in difficult-to-heal locations or challenging patient populations. We market our Affinity and Novachor products as wound coverings for acute surgical wounds and our PuraPly AM product as an antimicrobial barrier for the management of open wounds in the surgical setting. PuraForce is a bioengineered porcine collagen surgical matrix for use in soft tissue reinforcement applications.

## Bone Allograft Products

Our bone allograft products, which are derived from donated human cadaveric bone, include FiberOS and OCMP. Each of these products is used as a bone void filler, primarily in orthopedic and neurosurgical applications requiring bony fusion, such as spinal fusions and foot and ankle fusions. FiberOS is a blend of demineralized cortical fibers, mineralized cortical powder, and demineralized cortical powder and OCMP is a freeze-dried allograft cancellous (spongy or mesh-like) and demineralized cortical mixture.

## Ongoing Clinical Studies

We believe gathering robust and comprehensive clinical and real-world outcomes data is an essential component of developing a competitive product portfolio and driving further penetration in the markets where we compete. We have six ongoing prospective trials and comparative effectiveness studies, with several additional planned to commence in 2022. We continue to invest in generating clinical data for our Advanced Wound Care and Surgical & Sports Medicine products, and believe such data enhance sales efforts with physicians and reimbursement dynamics with payers over time. The tables below summarize the status of our recent clinical studies for our Advanced Wound Care and Surgical & Sports Medicine products.

## Recently Published Clinical Studies

## PuraPly AM

In a published prospective, multicenter, cohort study of 307 patients on the use of PuraPly AM in cutaneous wounds including acute and chronic wounds, 52, 62, and 73% of all wounds achieved closure at week 20, 26, and 32 respectively, with a median time to wound closure of 17 weeks. The wounds studied included 67 (22%) venous leg ulcers, 62 (20%) diabetic foot ulcers, 45 (15%) pressure ulcers, 54 (18%) post-surgical wounds, and 79 (26%) other wounds. For all 307 wounds, the incidence of achieving greater than a 60% reduction in baseline area and depth was 81 and 71% respectively. In addition, the incidence of wounds demonstrating greater than a 75% reduction in baseline volume was 85%.

## Affinity

In a published randomized controlled clinical trial of Affinity for use in diabetic foot ulcers comparing the use of Affinity and the standard of care (n=38) to the use of the standard of care alone (n=38), 60% of wounds in the Affinity and standard of care group achieved wound closure at 12 weeks compared to 38% of wounds in the standard of care group (p=0.04) and 63% of wounds in the Affinity and standard of care group achieved wound closure at 16 weeks compared to 38% of wounds in the standard of care group (p=0.04). In addition: 82% of wounds in the Affinity and standard of care group achieved a greater than 60% reduction in wound area as compared to 58% of wounds in the standard of care group (p=0.02); 65% of wounds in the Affinity and standard of care group achieved a greater than 60% reduction in wound depth as compared to 39% in the standard of care group (p=0.04); and 81% of wounds in the Affinity and standard of care group achieved a greater than 75% reduction in wound volume as compared to 58% in the standard of care group.

## Table of Contents

## NuShield

In a published clinical study of clinical experience using NuShield for the management of 50 wounds (VLUs (n=14), DFUs (n=24) and other wounds (n=12)), 45 (90%) of the wounds had wound closure percentages between 60% to 100%. The median time to complete wound closure (or healing) for all wounds was 102 days (14.6 weeks), and the percent healing rate of all wounds healed at 16 and 24 weeks was 56% and 73%, respectively. For DFUs treated with NuShield, the median time to healing was 120 days (17.1 weeks) and the percent healing rates at 16 and 24 weeks were 43% and 59%, respectively. For VLUs treated with NuShield, the median time to healing was 90 days (12.9 weeks), with percent healing rates of 56% and 85% at 16 and 24 weeks, respectively. For all other wounds treated with NuShield (including pressure ulcers, nonhealing surgical, ischemic, mixed etiology, and nonhealing amputation), the median time to healing was 48 days (6.9 weeks), with percent healing rates of 57% and 100% at 16 and 24 weeks, respectively.

## ReNu

In a 200-patient randomized controlled multicenter single-blind study comparing the treatment of knee OA symptoms with ReNu (n=68), a commercially available hyaluronic acid, or HA (n=64), and saline (n=68), patients treated with ReNu reported a clinically meaningful and statistically significant reduction in VAS pain and higher OMERACT-OARSI responder rate at 12 months follow-up compared to patients treated with HA or saline. Pain was also evaluated using the KOOS Pain score, and ReNu resulted in a statistically greater improvement in Pain compared to HA at both 3 and 6months.

A 474-patient Phase 3 prospective, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is underway to evaluate the efficacy of ReNu (Amniotic Suspension Allograft, "ASA") for the treatment symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (NCT04636229). Patients will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single intra-articular (IA) injection of 2 mL of ASA (plus 2 mL of normal saline) or 4 mL of normal saline. The primary efficacy endpoint has been defined as the difference in change from baseline in WOMAC Pain scale at 6 months between ASA- and placebo-treated patients. The design and statistical methodology of the current Phase III multi-center trial were informed and optimized based on the results of the 200 patient study.

## Table of Contents

## TransCyte

In a published study of the safety and efficacy of TransCyte for the treatment of partial thickness burns, the mean timing to achieve greater than 90% wound epithelialization was 11 days for patients treated with TransCyte as compared to 18 days for patients treated with silver sulfadiazine cream (p=0.002).

## Previously Published Clinical Studies forFDA-Approved Products

We also have accumulated a significant body of clinical evidence demonstrating the efficacy of ourFDA-approved products, Apligraf and Dermagraft. We continue to invest in generating similar data for other Advanced Wound Care and Surgical & Sports Medicine products, and believe such data enhance sales efforts with physicians and reimbursement dynamics with payers over time. Our product Apligraf is the only product that has obtained FDA approval for the treatment of both VLUs and DFUs. Our product Dermagraft has also received FDA approval for DFUs. Below is a summary of the primary data supporting each product, and a description of the clinical studies that are currently in progress. As used herein, p value is a measure of statistical significance. The lower the p value, the more likely it is that the results of a clinical trial or study are statistically significant rather than an experimental anomaly. Generally, to be considered statistically significant, such results must have a p value <0.05.

## Apligraf

Two pivotal studies were initially conducted with Apligraf demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the product in the treatment of full- and partialthickness VLUs and DLUs. As a result, Apligraf obtained FDA approval for these indications. We have conducted a number of additional studies that provide further clinical evidence of the safety and efficacy of the product, including recent comparative effectiveness, cost effectiveness and mechanism of action studies.

## Pivotal FDA Registration Trials

For the DFU indication, a multi-center prospective RCT of Apligraf for the treatment of DFUs versus standard of care was conducted. Two hundred eight patients with Type 1 and 2 diabetes were enrolled, who had a plantar DFU of full- or partial thickness. Patients with a chronic wound that exhibited less than 30% healing prior to treatment were eligible for the clinical trial. All patients' ulcers were off-loaded using either crutches or a wheelchair for the first six weeks, followed by customized pressure-relieving footwear for at least four weeks post closure. Mean ulcer size was 2.97 cm$^{2}$ and 2.83 cm$^{2}$ in the Apligraf and the control group, respectively. The mean duration of the ulcer was 12 months in the Apligraf group and 11 months in the control group.

Apligraf was significantly more effective than conventional therapy for the incidence of complete wound closure over time. By 12 weeks of treatment, 56% (63 of 112 patients) of DFUs treated with Apligraf plus conventional therapy (debridement, saline dressings, total off-loading) were 100% closed, compared to 38% (36 of 96 subjects) of ulcers treated with conventional therapy alone ( p =.0042). The median time to 100% wound closure was 65 days for DFUs treated with Apligraf plus conventional therapy versus 90 days for ulcers treated with conventional therapy alone ( p =.0026).

## Table of Contents

Recurrence is an important measure of healing durability, and in the study, 96% of ulcers treated with Apligraf remained closed at six months versus 87% in the control group. An important outcome of the study was an observed reduction in the incidence of reported adverse events of osteomyelitis and amputations/resections. Patients receiving Apligraf had a statistically significant ( p <.05) lower incidence of osteomyelitis at the study ulcer site (2.7% vs. 10.4%) compared to patients treated with conventional therapy at six months. Apligraf-treated patients required significantly fewer amputations or resections of the study limb (6.3% vs. 15.6%) ( p <.05) compared to patients treated with conventional therapy at six months. The primary results of the study are presented in the figures below.

Incidence of 100% Wound Closure

Median Time to 100% Wound Closure

Reduction in Osteomyelitis and Amputation / Resection

For the VLU pivotal trial, the efficacy of Apligraf was evaluated in a prospective, parallel-group, randomized, controlled, multi-center study involving 240 patients with VLUs. Subjects receiving Apligraf in combination with compression therapy were compared with an active treatment concurrent control of zinc paste gauze and compression therapy. Apligraf plus compression therapy was more effective in achieving complete wound closure by week 24 (57% vs 40%, p =.022). In patients with long-standing VLUs with greater than one year's duration (n=120), Apligraf plus compression therapy was more than twice as effective in achieving complete wound closure by week 24 (47% vs 19%, p =.002). The primary results of the study are presented in the figures below.

## Comparative Effectiveness and Economic Studies

We conducted four comparative effectiveness studies with Apligraf utilizing our proprietary access to data collected in Net Health's Wound Expert ® Electronic Medical Record, or EMR, database. Net Health's wound care software is utilized by more than 1,000 wound care centers across the United States. In collaboration with statistical experts and leading clinicians, we analyzed outcomes of treatment with Apligraf versus other skin substitutes including EpiFix (owned by MiMedx), Theraskin (owned by Bioventus, Inc.), Oasis (owned by Smith & Nephew) and Primatrix (Owned by Integra). All four studies showed that Apligraf improved overall healing rates as well as time to healing. For example, patients treated with Apligraf showed a 53% relative improvement in healing over patients treated with EpiFix at 24 weeks. All four studies have been published in peer-reviewed journals.

The Analysis Group, a private economics consulting firm, conducted a study to evaluate the economic outcomes of Medicare patients receiving Apligraf and Dermagraft, assessing the real-world medical services utilization and associated costs compared to patients receiving conventional care. Data for 502 matched Apligraf and conventional care patient pairs and 222 matched Dermagraft and conventional care patient pairs were analyzed. Increased costs associated with outpatient service utilization relative to matched conventional care patients were offset by lower amputation rates, fewer days hospitalized and fewer emergency department visits among Apligraf and Dermagraft patients. Consequently, Apligraf and Dermagraft patients with DFUs had per-patient average healthcare costs during the18-month follow-up period that were lower than their respective matched conventional care counterparts (Apligraf was $5,253 ( p =0.49), lower per patient, while Dermagraft was $6,991 ( p =0.84) lower). These findings suggest that use of Apligraf and Dermagraft for treatment of DFU may lower overall medical costs through reduced utilization of costly healthcare services.

## Mechanism of Action Clinical Study

To elucidate the mechanisms through which Apligraf promotes healing of chronic VLUs, the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine Department of Dermatology & Cutaneous Surgery conducted an RCT in which 24 patients with non-healing VLUs were treated with either standard of care (compression therapy) or Apligraf together with standard of care. Tissue biopsies were collected from the VLU edge before and one week after treatment, and the samples underwent a comprehensive analysis of gene expression and protein analyses. The analyses conducted suggest that Apligraf induced a shift from a non-healing to a healing tissue response, involving modulation of inflammatory and growth factor signaling, keratinocyte activation, and attenuation of signaling involved in the chronic ulcer impaired state. In these ways, Apligraf application orchestrated a shift from the chronic non-healing ulcer microenvironment to a distinctive healing milieu resembling that of an acute, healing wound.

## Dermagraft

Dermagraft was approved as a Class III medical device for the treatment of DFUs based on the results of a large pivotal clinical trial. Three hundred fourteen patients were enrolled in a prospective RCT to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Dermagraft in conjunction with conventional therapy compared to a control arm of conventional therapy alone. Conventional therapy involved the sharp debridement and cleaning of the ulcer, application of a wet-to-dry gauze and the use of therapeutic, pressure-reducing footwear. Patients were eligible to be screened for the trial if they had a plantar DFU on the heel or forefoot that was greater than 1cm$^{2}$ and less than 20cm$^{2}$. At the screening visit, the patients began receiving conventional therapy. If the DFU had not decreased in size by more than 50% during the next two weeks and the patient met all other inclusion and exclusion criteria, the patient was randomized into one of two treatment groups: Dermagraft plus conventional therapy or conventional therapy alone. Patients in the Dermagraft group received a weekly application of Dermagraft and conventional therapy for up to eight weeks. The primary endpoint for the trial was superiority in complete DFU closure by 12 weeks.

## Table of Contents

## Pivotal FDA Registration Trial

In the pivotal clinical trial, the weekly application of Dermagraft and conventional therapy for up to eight weeks increased the proportion of DFUs that achieved 100% closure at 12 weeks by 64%, when compared to the use of conventional therapy alone. Patients treated in the Dermagraft group were 1.7 times more likely to achieve 100% closure than patients receiving conventional therapy alone. These results demonstrated statistically significant improvements. The incidence of adverse events among the Dermagraft and control groups was generally consistent across both groups, with the most common adverse events being infection at the DFU site, infection not at the DFU site, accidental injury and skin dysfunction/blister. However, the percentage of patients who developed an infection at the DFU site was significantly lower in the Dermagraft treatment group as compared with the control group, 10.4% versus 17.9%, respectively. No adverse laboratory findings were associated with the use of Dermagraft and no adverse device effects were reported in the trial. In addition, no immunological responses or rejections from patients that received Dermagraft were reported in this trial or in patients treated to date. The primary healing data for the trial is presented in the figure below.

## Percent of Patients with Complete Healing by 12 Weeks

In a post-hoc analysis, it was determined that in patients treated with Dermagraft there was a significant reduction in incidence of amputations or bone resections, as compared to the control group (12.6% versus 5.5%, respectively, p=0.031). No adverse laboratory findings were associated with the use of Dermagraft and no adverse device effects were reported in the trial. In addition, no immunological responses or rejections from patients that received Dermagraft were reported in this trial or in patients treated to date. The amputation or bone resection data is presented in the figure below.

Comparative Effectiveness and Economic Studies

We have conducted three comparative effectiveness studies with Dermagraft, which utilizes our proprietary access to data collected in the EMR database. In collaboration with statistical experts and leading clinicians, we analyzed outcomes of treatment with Dermagraft versus other skin substitutes including EpiFix (owned by MiMedx), Primatrix (owned by Integra) and Grafix (owned by Smith & Nephew). All three studies showed that Dermagraft improved overall healing rates as well as time to healing. In one study, patients treated with Dermagraft showed a 52% relative improvement in healing over EpiFix by week 24.

The economic study of Dermagraft in a Medicare population conducted by the Analysis Group is described under the heading "-Our ProductsPreviously Published Clinical Studies for FDA-Approved Products-Apligraf-Comparative Effectiveness and Economic Studies" above.

## Product Pipeline

We have a robust pipeline of products under development for both the Advanced Wound Care and Surgical & Sports Medicine markets. We believe our pipeline efforts will deepen our comprehensive portfolio of offerings as well as allow us to address additional clinical applications. The following table summarizes our pipeline products and potential timeline for their commercial launch:

## PuraPly MZ

PuraPly MZ is a micronized particulate version of PuraPly that allows application in powder or gel form to deep and tunneling wounds. Like PuraPly, PuraPly MZ is intended for indications for the management of chronic and acute wounds (other than 3rd-degree burns) and in conjunction with the surgical treatment of open wounds. We have submitted a 510(k) application for PuraPly MZ and plan to commercially launch this product as soon as early 2022 if we receive FDA Clearance.

## Cord Membrane

We have a cord membrane product under development. The design objective is to develop a thick, strong graft with a long shelf life stored at room temperature. The cord membrane maintains native tissue elements and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. The intended use for this product is as a wound covering. We have submitted a request to the FDA Tissue Reference Group (TRG) to clarify the regulatory status of this product when utilized as a wound covering.

## Other Placental Products

Our R&D Team continues to research and develop additional product concepts from our placental technology platform, as well as to collaborate with our Business Development team to assess additional product in-licensing or acquisition opportunities.

## Table of Contents

## Apligraf and Dermagraft Line Extensions

We have two development projects underway to develop additional sizes of Apligraf and Dermagraft. The objective is to develop at least one additional smaller size of each product to optimize the product pricing and clinical utilization for smaller wounds such as Diabetic Foot Ulcers. These types of changes to living cell-based products require significant development and validation work, and will require FDA PMA Supplement approval for the changes. Therefore, we expect the duration of the development projects to be several years before commercial products will be available.

## TransCyte

TransCyte is a bioengineered tissue scaffold that promotes burn healing, and has received PMA approval for the treatment of deep second- and thirddegree burns. We acquired the product from Shire, and it was previously marketed by Smith & Nephew. TransCyte complements our portfolio to address all severities of burn wounds. TransCyte is a flexible, durable product that provides bioactive dermal components, an outer protective barrier, increased re-epithelialization and pain relief for patients suffering from burns. We believe TransCyte will address a sizable market opportunity with limited competition, with only one other PMA approved product that would be directly competitive to TransCyte currently on the market. We plan to initiate a market re-introduction and clinical experience program in 2022. Full launch is dependent on completion of our new manufacturing facility at our Canton, MA campus.

## FortiShield

FortiShield is a biosynthetic wound matrix made from a semi-permeable silicone membrane bonded to a kitted nylon fabric that is coated in a dermal collagen to provide a flexible dressing that is designed to adhere to the application site, provide a barrier to the external environment, and allow for excess exudate drainage. FortiShield is intended for use a temporary wound covering, and to provide a moist wound healing environment on cleanly debrided wounds after hemostasis has been established. The primary indication for the product is as a transitional wound matrix for deep second degree burns. There are additionally other chronic and acute wound applications. A 510(k) application has been filed, and FDA has requested additional preclinical testing which is ongoing. If the product receives 510(k) clearance, we plan to commercially launch it for acute and chronic wound applications, and then subsequently as part of the burn portfolio in alignment with TransCyte.

## ReNu

ReNu is a cryopreserved suspension derived from human amniotic tissue and cells derived from amniotic fluid, formulated for office use. It has been used to support healing of soft tissues, particularly in degenerative conditions such as OA and joint and tendon injuries such as tendinosis and fasciitis. The target indication for ReNu is for the management of symptoms associated with knee osteoarthritis. A pilot clinical study of ReNu for knee OA has been published, which we believe may indicate signs of its safety and suggest potential efficacy for a period of more than a year. On May 31, 2021, we suspended commercial distribution of ReNu in connection with the end of the FDA's enforcement grace period for certain products that previously were marketed as 361 HCT/Ps. We are continuing to conduct clinical studies of ReNu to support BLA approval for the management of symptoms associated with knee osteoarthritis and, based on feasibility studies that are subject to further evaluation, we believe ReNu may have potential as a treatment for additional osteoarthritis and tissue regeneration applications, which would need to be clinically evaluated further before any such approved uses. ReNu was launched in 2015 by NuTech Medical and acquired by us in 2017.

Our proprietary LayerLoc process technology preserves the native structure of the amnion and chorion membranes, optimized to provide excellent strength, flexibility, and handling.
- · Antimicrobial Technology: Our Polyhexamethylene Biguanide (PHMB) antimicrobial technology provides clinical and competitive advantage for multiple wound indications. PHMB is a broad-spectrum effective antimicrobial that prevents biofilm reformation. We have developed multiple product versions incorporating PHMB that have demonstrated clinical benefit to control bioburden and support wound healing when used following wound debridement.

## Commercial Infrastructure

## Sales and Marketing

We have dedicated substantial resources to establish a multi-faceted sales capability in the United States. Our current Advanced Wound Care portfolio is sold throughout the United States via an experienced direct sales force, which focuses its efforts on wound care in various sites of care. We use a mix of direct sales representatives and independent agencies to service the Surgical & Sports Medicine market. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 340 direct sales representatives and approximately 160 independent agencies who have substantial medical device sales experience in our target end markets. These sales representatives are supported by teams of professionals focused on sales management, sales operations and effectiveness, ongoing training, analytics and marketing.

We have historically focused our market development and commercial activities on the United States, but we have obtained marketing registrations, developed commercial and distribution capabilities, and we are currently selling products in several countries outside of the United States. Our Apligraf product is currently distributed by our direct sales force in Switzerland, and through independent sales agents in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Our NuShield product is also distributed by our direct sales force in Switzerland, and through independent sales agents in Kuwait. We have obtained marketing registration for our Dermagraft product in Mexico, but we are not currently distributing it. Additionally, we are evaluating the regulatory pathways and market potential for our products in other major markets, including the European Union. Sales generated by our direct sales forces in the United States have represented, and we anticipate will continue to represent, a majority of our revenues.

## Table of Contents

## Customer Support Services

We offer our customers in-house customer support services, including services provided by our experienced reimbursement support team, our medical and technical support team and our field-based medical science liaison team. We believe that we have a competitive advantage by providing these essential support services in-house in that we are able to align the support services closely with our sales efforts as appropriate and improve the customer's overall experience.

## Research and Development

Our research and development team has extensive experience in developing regenerative medicine products, and works to design products that are intended to improve patient outcomes, simplify techniques, shorten procedures, reduce hospitalization and rehabilitation times and, as a result, reduce costs. We conduct research and development activities at our laboratory facilities in Canton, MA, Birmingham, AL and San Diego, CA. We have recruited and retained staff with significant experience and skills, gained through both industry experience and training at leading colleges and universities with regenerative medicine graduate programs. In addition to our internal staff, our external network of development labs, testing labs and expert clinicians aid us in our research and development process. We continue to build our clinical operations capabilities to effectively run multiple concurrent multicenter clinical trials. We have significant regulatory affairs capabilities to prepare and manage our regulatory submissions for product approvals.

The majority of our product portfolio, including Apligraf, our PuraPly product family, our collagen biomaterial technology platform product family and all of our placental-based products, were developed by our research and development team at our three facilities. We have proven competencies to bring products to market via a broad range of regulatory classifications, as evidenced by FDA approval or clearance of our products via PMA approval of a Class III medical device; BLA approval of a biologics product; and 510(k) clearance of a Class II medical device, in addition to our 361 HCT/P allograft products and several products for which we have obtained international registrations.

## Manufacturing and Suppliers

We manufacture internally our primary non-placental-based products and use third-party manufacturers for our placental-based products. We have significant expansion capabilities in our in-house manufacturing facilities and we believe that our contract manufacturers are well positioned to support future expansion.

We have robust internal compliance processes to maintain the high quality and reliability of our products. We use annual internal audits, combined with external audits by regulatory agencies to monitor our quality control practices. We are registered with the FDA as a medical device manufacturing establishment and a HCT/P registered establishment. We are also accredited by the AATB and licensed with several states per their tissue banks regulations. All of our contract manufacturers are registered with the FDA as HCT/P establishments and are AATB accredited.

We utilize third-party raw material suppliers to support our internal manufacturing processes. We select all of our suppliers through a rigorous process to ensure high quality and reliability with the capacity to support our expanding production levels. Only raw material from approved suppliers is used in the manufacture of our products. To confirm quality and identify any risks, our approved suppliers are audited at pre-determined intervals. Historically, we have not experienced any significant difficulty locating and obtaining the suppliers or materials necessary to fulfill our production requirements. In the first quarter of 2019, however, we suspended production of our product Affinity due to production issues at one of our suppliers. As this was our sole supplier of Affinity, it resulted in a disruption of our production capabilities. We identified an alternate supplier and were able to resume commercial-scale production in the second quarter of 2020. Subsequently, we have added a second source to provide additional capacity and redundancy in supply.

## Table of Contents

The manufacture of our products is dependent on the availability of sufficient quantities of source tissue, which is the primary component of our products. Source tissue includes donated human tissue, porcine tissue and bovine tissue. We acquire donated human tissue directly through institutional review board-approved protocols at multiple hospitals, as well as through tissue procurement firms engaged by us or by our contract manufacturers. We have two qualified porcine tissue suppliers, and currently one source of bovine tissue. Our processing of these tissues is, and our supplier sources are required to be, compliant with applicable FDA current Good Tissue Practice, or cGTP, regulations, AATB standards and U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, requirements.

## Reimbursement

## Overview

Our customers primarily consist of hospitals, wound care centers, government facilities, ASCs and physician offices, all of which rely on coverage and reimbursement for our products by Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payers. Governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, typically have published and defined coverage criteria and published reimbursement rates for medical products, services and procedures that are established by law or regulation. Non-government payers have their own coverage criteria and often negotiate payment rates for medical products, services and procedures. Many also require prior authorization as a prerequisite to coverage. In addition, in the United States, an increasing percentage of insured individuals are receiving their medical care through managed care programs, which monitor utilization and also may require prior authorization for the products and services that a member receives. Coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial payers is not assured and is subject to change.

Medicare, the federally funded program that provides healthcare coverage for senior citizens and the disabled, is the largest third-party payer in the United States. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"), administers the Medicare program and uses Medicare Administrative Contractors ("MACs") to process claims, develop coverage policies and make payments within designated geographic jurisdictions. CMS does not have a national coverage determination related to skin substitutes. Coverage for our products falls under the jurisdiction of the Part A/B MACs. Medicare coverage for our products is determined by each MAC for its specific jurisdiction. Currently, all the MACs, even those without published local coverage determinations ("LCDs"), cover our products in the outpatient hospital, physician office and ASC settings.

Private payers often, but not always, follow the lead of Medicare or other governmental payers in making coverage and reimbursement determinations. Therefore, achieving favorable Medicare coverage and reimbursement can sometimes be a significant factor in obtaining favorable coverage and reimbursement for products by private payers. While most private payers currently cover Apligraf and Dermagraft, and some cover Affinity, most of those payers do not cover many of our other products, such as PuraPly, PuraPly AM, and NuShield.

Currently, Medicare makes separate a payment for our products when used in the physician office at a payment rate of average sales price (ASP) plus 6%. Legislation was recently enacted that temporarily discontinued the sequestration rate of 2% of the government portion; under sequestration, the final payment rate is ASP+4.3%. The sequestration is expected to begin again on April 1, 2022 at a rate of 1%. Starting on July 1, 2022, the sequestration rate will return to 2%. In the outpatient hospital and ASC settings, Medicare payment for all our products is bundled into the payment for the application procedure.

All skin substitute products administered in the hospital outpatient department and ASC settings are bundled, except for those products that have been approved by CMS for pass-through status. No skin substitute products currently have pass-through status. Pursuant to the Appropriations Act, PuraPly AM and PuraPly had pass-through status from October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2020 at which time the pass-through status expired. As of October 1, 2020, payment for PuraPly and PuraPly AM is bundled into the payment rate for the application procedure. The amount of the pass-through payment for PuraPly AM and PuraPly was equal to ASP + 6% for the applicable calendar quarter.

## Skin Substitutes Used for Wound Care

All of our Advanced Wound Care products are classified as "skin substitutes" for Medicare reimbursement purposes. In 2014, CMS instituted "bundled" payments in the hospital outpatient and ASC setting for skin substitutes using a two-tier payment system. The Medicare payment system bundles payment for our products (and all skin substitutes) into the payment for the application of the skin substitute, resulting in a single payment to the provider that includes both the application of the product and the product itself. There is one bundled payment amount for procedures that involve high cost products, i.e., products whose cost exceeds a threshold amount, and another bundled payment amount for procedures that involve low cost products that do not meet the threshold. The bundled payment rate is updated annually and is also geographically adjusted. Currently, all of our wound care products are assigned to the high cost bundle; it is not possible to predict, however, whether those products will continue to be assigned to the high cost bundle or the rates that will be paid for each bundle. Further, under the bundling policy, there is an inherent incentive to use the cheapest products available, even if those products are less effective.

The bundled payment rates are also geographically adjusted. This geographic adjustment may result in significant payment variations among regions; for example, sixty percent of the hospital payment rate and fifty percent of the ASC payment is adjusted to take into account the region's wage-index, which can vary widely from one region to another. The wage-index adjustment can increase or decrease the unadjusted payment amount and may result in reimbursement being insufficient to account for the cost of skin substitute products and sizes in one geographic area that are fully reimbursed in other geographic areas.

All skin substitute products administered in the hospital outpatient department and ASC settings are bundled, except for those products that have been approved by CMS for pass-through status. In order to encourage the development of innovative medical devices, drugs and biologics, Congress created passthrough payments to allow payment for new innovative medical products to be added to the current Medicare rate. For a limited period of time, products with pass-through status are reimbursed through an additional reimbursement amount known as a "pass through payment," for the medical device, drug or biologic on top of the bundled payment amount the hospital would receive for performing the service. The additional payment amount is the hospital's charge for the pass-through product reduced to cost using the hospital's specific cost to charge ratio, less an offset for the amount of money already included in the bundle for skin substitute products. No skin substitute products currently have pass-through status.

PuraPly AM and PuraPly were included in the "bundled" payment structure from January 1, 2018 through September 30, 2018. Section 1301 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, which was enacted on March 23, 2018, restored the pass-through status of PuraPly AM and PuraPly effective October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2020. The amount of the pass-through payment for PuraPly AM and PuraPly was equal to ASP + 6% for the applicable calendar quarter. The Consolidated Appropriations Act applied only to Medicare, and did not apply to Medicaid or any commercial payers. As noted above, as of October 1, 2020, payment for PuraPly and PuraPly AM is once again bundled into the payment rate for the application procedure.

Medicare has signaled that it may revise itstwo-tiered bundled payment policy for skin substitutes. Medicare solicited comments in calendar year 2019 proposed rule related to proposed updates and policy changes under the Medicare Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) and ASC Payment System. Medicare specifically solicited comments on whether it should eliminate the two-tiered bundle policy and establish a single bundle for all products. It is possible that Medicare will revise its payment policy in calendar year 2022 or calendar year 2023. Any revised policy could result in decreased reimbursement for our products which could decrease utilization and reduce our revenues. Moreover, any new policy could result in a financial incentive for hospitals and ASCs to use our competitor's products, thereby reducing our market share and revenue.

In the physician office setting, payment for skin substitutes is not bundled into the payment for the administration of the product. Skin substitutes are paid separately from the application procedure and the

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

## Table of Contents

Medicare payment rate for all biological skin substitutes (including ours) is calculated based on the manufacturer's ASP on a per square centimeter basis with the total payment for the product being the per square centimeter ASP-based payment rate multiplied by the total number of centimeters. In the physician office setting the Medicare payment rates for all biological skin substitutes (including ours) are updated quarterly based on manufacturer-reported ASP and are not geographically adjusted. The actual payment rate for skin substitutes is ASP plus 6% before application of a sequestration reduction required by law. Sequestration reduces by two percent the federal portion of the Medicare payment amount; the beneficiary coinsurance amount of 20 percent is unaffected by sequestration. Congress has suspended sequestration during the COVID-19 public health emergency. Recent legislation continued the suspension of the sequestration until April 1, 2022 at which time the reduction will be one percent. Starting on July 1, 2022, the sequestration rate will return to two percent.

The ASP-based payment methodology applies only to physician offices. However, in the future, it is possible, through legislation or regulation, that Medicare will institute bundled payment for skin substitutes in the physician office setting. Previously, Medicare did not require us to report ASP for our products because they are regulated by the FDA as medical devices; we voluntarily reported ASP data for most products However, starting in April 30, 2022, we will be required to report ASP for all our products because of a provision enacted in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020, signed into law on December 27, 2020. The April 2022 ASP report will be for Q1 2022. CMS does not necessarily include all products that report ASP data in the quarterly ASP file. The local Part A/B MACs establish local payment for drugs and biologics whose ASP does not appear in the quarterly ASP file. MACs have the discretion to pay for such products based on invoices submitted by providers, Wholesale Acquisition Cost ("WAC") + 6%, or they may contact CMS to determine if there are unpublished ASP data.

In the calendar year 2022 Final Rule for the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, CMS established ten healthcare common procedure coding system, or HCPCS codes that describe synthetic skin substitutes. CMS has directed MACs to make separate payments for these codes when they are reported with the CPT codes for the application of skin substitutes. Because manufacturers of these products are not required to establish a WAC, or submit an ASP (because they are not treated as drugs or biologics by Medicare), it is likely the Part A/B MACs will pay for these products based on invoices. We do not know what effect this will have on our business or revenue.

Commercial insurers contract with participating providers such as hospitals, wound care centers, government facilities, ASCs and physician offices to establish agreed-upon payment rates for items and services, including skin substitutes. Usually, these rates are in the form of a fee-schedule but sometimes there is a bundled payment rate. In many cases, the fee schedules are based on Medicare payment rates, which are bundled in hospitals and ASCs, but not in physician offices. These rates may vary by insurer, provider and by region.

Medicaid coverage and payment rates and policies as to the types of providers (e.g., podiatrists) who are allowed to apply our products are determined by each state's Medicaid program. Some states may bundle Medicaid payment for skin substitutes into the payment for the application procedure, like Medicare, while other states may pay separately. State Medicaid programs may reach different conclusions regarding the medical necessity of products used in treating Medicaid patients.

## Surgical & Sports Medicine Products

Surgical & Sports Medicine products administered on an inpatient basis in a hospital are reimbursed by Medicare as part of a bundled payment based on the Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group, or MS-DRG, to which a patient is assigned upon discharge from the hospital.MS-DRG assignment is determined according to the patient's primary diagnosis, but can also be affected by other diagnoses that affect the patient's condition and the provision of certain surgical procedures. In addition, certain MS-DRGs account for complications and comorbidities, which may increase the reimbursement amount.

## Table of Contents

The MS-DRG payment rate is a consolidated prospective payment for all services provided by the hospital during the patient's hospitalization, based on the average cost of care calculated from Medicare claims data. With extremely few exceptions, the MS-DRG payment is inclusive of all services, products, and resources. Products administered during surgical procedures are not typically coded or paid separately when provided to a hospital inpatient. MS-DRG payments are case rates and hospitals profit when their costs for a particular patient are below the case-rate and they are at risk of a loss if their costs are above the case rate.

Some private payers use the MS-DRG based system to reimburse facilities for inpatient services.

## Competition

We operate in highly competitive markets that are subject to rapid technological change. Success in these markets depends primarily on product efficacy, ease of product use, product price, availability of coverage and adequate third-party reimbursement, customer support services for technical, clinical and reimbursement support, and customer preference for, and loyalty to, the products.

We believe that the demonstrated clinical efficacy of our products, the breadth of our product portfolio, ourin-house customer support services, our customer relationships and reputation offer us advantages over our competitors. In addition, we believe we are one of the few regenerative medicine companies offering PMA approved and 510(k) cleared products in addition to our 361 HCT/Ps.

Our products compete primarily with skin substitute products, placental-based technology products, orthobiologics products, other advanced wound care and traditional wound care products, among others. Our competitors include 3M, Incorporated, Amniox Medical, Inc., Arthrex, Inc., Integra LifeSciences Holdings Corporation, MiMedx Group, Inc., Smith & Nephew plc, Bioventus Inc. and Vivex Biologics.

We also compete in the marketplace to recruit and retain qualified scientific, management and sales personnel, as well as to acquire technologies and technology licenses complementary to our products or advantageous to our business.

We are aware of several companies that compete, or are developing technologies, in our current and future product areas. As a result, we expect competition to remain intense. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to develop proprietary products that reach the market in a timely manner, receive adequate coverage and reimbursement, are cost effective and are safe and effective.

## Intellectual Property

Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property and operate without infringing the patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We rely on a combination of trademark, trade secret, patents, copyright and other intellectual property rights and measures to protect the intellectual property rights that we consider important to our business. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. Other than a license from Novartis Pharma AG for trademark and domain name rights to Apligraf and an exclusive license from RESORBA Medical GmbH, or Resorba, to a U.S. patent for a collagen-based wound dressing containing PHMB, we do not have any additional material licenses to any technology or intellectual property rights. Under the terms of the exclusive license from Resorba, we were obligated to make minimum royalty payments of $1.0 million in each of 2018 and 2019, and were subject to a $2.5 million minimum royalty payment in 2017, as part of an ongoing low single-digit royalty payment on net sales of PuraPly AM; the term of the license shall continue for the life of the patent, which expires in October 2026. We may also terminate the license upon written notice to Resorba in the event that (i) the patent is invalidated or (ii) we stop all activities that would require a license to the patent, and either party may terminate the license in the event of a material breach by the other party, subject to notice and an ability to cure. In addition, we were obligated to make upfront and maintenance payments totaling $0.6 million at specified periods prior to April 1, 2019, including a payment of $0.2 million that was made on July 1, 2018. The license is assignable but not sub-licensable.

## Table of Contents

As of December 31, 2021, we owned 20 issued patents globally, of which 12 were U.S. patents. As of December 31, 2021, we owned 13 pending patent applications, of which 10 were patent applications pending in the United States. Subject to payment of required maintenance fees, annuities and other charges, many of our issued patents are currently expected to expire between 2027 and 2038. The expiration of these patents is not expected to have a material impact on our business. In addition, many of our products, including our Apligraf, Dermagraft and NuShield products, are not covered by our issued patents or pending patent applications. Our issued patents are drawn to the following main areas: methods of making and using cultured tissue constructs, methods for preparing multi-layer stacks of living tissue, methods for treating recessed oral gingiva using cultured tissue constructs, methods of making and using osteogenic implants comprising a placental membrane sheet, wound treatment methods using amniotic stem cell solutions and placental membrane sheets, methods of generating cartilage in a skeletal joint using placental membrane preparations, hepatocyte growth factor- and hyaluronic acidcontaining compositions and methods of using such compositions, methods making placental membrane preparations comprising hyaluronic acid, methods of harvesting or proliferating human prenatal stem cells, hypothermic morselized placental membrane storage methods, uses of human amniotic fluid for treating chronic wounds and joint diseases, and adjustable debridement curette apparatuses. Our pending patent applications encompass additional areas, including wound treating methods using morselized amnion tissue and amniotic-derived cells, methods of assessing native stem cell populations using cultured isolated stem cells and reference cell sources, visco-supplement compositions and musculoskeletal inflammatory treatment methods using same, wound care treatment and methods of making and using such treatment, model systems and methods to characterize anti-inflammatory activity, and porcine collagen compositions and methods of using such compositions. Our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents and we can give no assurance that any patents that have been issued or might be issued in the future will protect our current or future products or provide us with any competitive advantage. See the section titled " Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property " for additional information.

Additionally, we own or have rights to trademarks or trade names that are used in our business and in conjunction with the sale of our products, including 11 U.S. trademark registrations and 8 foreign trademark registrations, as of December 31, 2021.

We also seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to our proprietary information.

## Government Regulation

## FDA Regulation of Product Registration, Manufacture and Promotion

We market medical products in the United States that have either been approved or cleared by the FDA prior to marketing, or do not require FDA premarket review. Our marketed products that have received marketing authorization from the FDA have done so under one of the following agency pathways: 510(k) clearance for a Class II medical device or approval of a PMA for a Class III medical device. These medical products are regulated by the FDA under the PHSA or the FDCA along with the FDA's implementing regulations. These federal statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the following activities that we perform or are performed on our behalf and will continue to perform or have performed on our behalf: the production, research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, packaging, labeling, storage, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution of our products into interstate commerce, record keeping, service and surveillance, complaint handling, repair or recall of products, adverse event reporting and other field safety corrective actions.

## FDA Regulatory Review and Approval Process

Unless an exemption applies or the product is a Class I device, each medical device that we market must first receive either 510(k) clearance or PMA approval from the FDA. In addition, certain modifications made to

## Table of Contents

marketed devices also may require 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA supplement. We maintain necessary clearances and approvals for products derived from porcine, bovine, and human tissues that are regulated by the FDA. PuraPly, PuraPly AM, PuraPly XT, and PuraForce are medical devices that have been cleared for marketing under a number of 510(k)s for uses such as wound dressing, intraoral barrier, and surgical mesh. We also maintain medical device approvals for the Apligraf (P950032) and Dermagraft (P000036) devices, both approved by the FDA as chronic wound treatments.

With respect to the manufacture of medical devices and biologics, the FDA regulates and inspects equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to providing approval to market products. After receiving approval from the FDA, additional regulatory review or inspection may be required if we make a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process. Our manufacturing processes must comply with the FDA's Quality System Regulation, or QSR, for our medical device products. The QSR requires that each device manufacturer establish and implement a quality system under which the manufacturer monitors the manufacturing process and maintains records that show compliance with FDA regulations and the manufacturer's written specifications and procedures relating to the devices. Among other things, these regulations require that manufacturers establish performance requirements before production and follow requirements applicable to design controls, testing, record keeping, documentation, manufacturing standards, labeling, complaint handling, and management review.

Manufacturers of biologics must comply with applicable cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of such products also must register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing process. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional preclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biologic product candidate, as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents or of causing other adverse events with the use of biologic products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other requirements, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biologic product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

The FDA conducts periodic visits, both announced and unannounced, tore-inspect our equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes to confirm regulatory compliance. These inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors. Following an inspection, the FDA may issue a report, known as a 483, listing instances where the manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulations and/or procedures or, if observed violations are severe and urgent, a warning letter. If the manufacturer does not adequately respond to a 483 or warning letter, the FDA may take enforcement action against the manufacturer or impose other sanctions or consequences, which may include:

- · cease and desist orders;
- · injunctions, or consent decrees;
- · civil monetary penalties;
- · recall, detention or seizure of our products;
- · operating restrictions, partial or total shutdown of production facilities;
- · refusal of or delay in granting our requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA or BLA approval of new products or modified products;

## Table of Contents

- · withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMA/BLA approvals that are already granted;
- · refusal to grant export approval or export certificates for our products; and
- · criminal prosecution.

In addition, we must comply with medical device reporting regulations and corrections and removal reporting regulations. Medical device reporting regulations require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. Corrections and removal reporting regulations require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health. The FDA may also order a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death.

Certain human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products, or HCT/Ps, are regulated under Section 361 of the PHSA and are referred to as "Section 361 HCT/Ps" or simply "361 HCT/Ps," while other HCT/Ps are subject to the FDA's regulatory requirements for medical devices and/or biologics. A product that is regulated as a 361 HCT/P may be commercially distributed without prior FDA clearance or approval. Pursuant to 21 CFR 1271.10, in order to be regulated as a 361 HCT/P, and hence exempt from premarket review, an HCT/P must be minimally manipulated, intended for homologous use, and manufactured without being combined with another article (except for water, crystalloids, or sterilizing, preserving, or storage agents). The HCT/P must also either have no systemic effect and not be dependent upon the metabolic activity of living cells for its primary function or, if it has a systemic effect, be intended for autologous use, for allogeneic use in a first-degree or second-degree blood relative or for reproductive use. We believe that Affinity and NuShield generally fulfill the relevant criteria under 21 CFR 1271.10. In light of the 361 HCT/P Guidance, our labeling and marketing claims for Affinity and NuShield clarify that they are intended for use as wound coverings, and thus qualify as Section 361 HCT/Ps. However, the FDA could disagree with our conclusion and require premarket approval or clearance for Affinity, NuShield or any placental-based sheet product we presently or may in the future market, which would disrupt the marketing of these products, potentially expose us to regulatory sanctions, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Section 361 HCT/Ps are subject to specific FDA regulations that include cGTPs, donor eligibility determination requirements, adverse event reporting, and advertising and labeling requirements. cGTP regulations govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of HCT/Ps, including but not limited to all steps in recovery, donor screening, donor testing, processing, storage, labeling, packaging, and distribution.

Before testing any biologic product candidate in humans, the product candidate must undergo preclinical testing. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, potency, toxicity and formulation, as well as in vivo studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually must complete some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product.

The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. The FDA may impose clinical holds on a biologic product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, clinical trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials.

## Table of Contents

Clinical trials involve the administration of the biologic product candidate to volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators who generally are physicians not employed by, or under, the control of the trial sponsor. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and certain amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA's regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers items such as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject, or their legal representative, reviews and approves the trial protocol, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap, be combined, or be bifurcated into two parts:

- · Phase 1. The biological product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product candidate may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
- · Phase 2. The biological product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
- · Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product approval and labeling. In January 2021, we announced that the first patient was enrolled in the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of ReNu for the management of symptoms associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA).

Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. Sometimes approval for a product is conditional upon the completion of post-marketing clinical studies.

During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the IRB, and the investigators for: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; any findings from other trials; findings from animal or in vivo laboratory tests or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects; or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report as soon as possible, but in no case later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but no later than seven calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the information.

The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable

## Table of Contents

health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the biologic product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.

## Expedited Development and Review Programs

The FDA is authorized to expedite the review of BLAs in several ways. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a biologic product candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND. Biologic products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have greater interactions with the FDA, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track BLA before the application is complete, a process known as rolling review.

Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as breakthrough therapy designation, regenerative medicine advance therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval.

- · Breakthrough therapy designation. To qualify for the breakthrough therapy program, product candidates must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence must indicate that such product candidates may demonstrate substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program; intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review; and a rolling review.
- · Regenerative Medicine Advance Therapy (RMAT) designation. RMAT was introduced as a new designation under the 21st Century Cures Act for the development and review of certain regenerative medicine therapies. As set forth in section 506(g)(8) of the FDCA, the term "regenerative medicine therapy" is defined to include cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products, except for those regulated solely under section 361 of the PHSA. To receive RMAT designation, a regenerative medicine product candidate must be intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition with preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs. RMAT designation does not require evidence to indicate that the drug may offer a substantial improvement over available therapies, as breakthrough designation requires. Similar to breakthrough designation, an RMAT product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program; involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review; and a rolling review. Regenerative medicine therapies that qualify for RMAT designation may also qualify for other FDA expedited programs, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval, and priority review designation, if they meet the criteria for such programs. In January 2021, we announced ReNu received the RMAT designation from the FDA for the management of symptoms associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA).
- · Accelerated approval. Drugs or biologic products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval. Accelerated approval means that a product candidate may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefits, taking into account the severity, rarity and prevalence of the condition and the

## Table of Contents

availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, for accelerated approval products FDA typically requires pre- dissemination submission of promotional materials to FDA for the agency's consideration. A drug approved under the accelerated approval pathway may have its approval revoked on several grounds including if a required post-approval trial fails to verify clinical benefit or does not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to justify the risks associated with the drug.

Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, RMAT designation and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.

## Post-approval Requirements

FDA regulation of biologic products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP requirements, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biologic products include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal actions and adverse publicity. These actions could include refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical hold, suspension or termination of a clinical trial by an IRB, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines or other monetary penalties, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare providers, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits or other civil or criminal penalties.

## Medical Product Marketing and Promotion

Advertising, marketing and promotional activities for devices and biologics are also subject to FDA oversight and must comply with the statutory standards of the FDCA, and the FDA's implementing regulations. The FDA's oversight authority review of marketing and promotional activities encompasses, but is not limited to, direct-to-consumer advertising, healthcare provider-directed advertising and promotion, sales representative communications to healthcare professionals, promotional programming and promotional activities involving electronic media. The FDA also regulates industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities that make representations regarding product safety or efficacy in a promotional context. A sponsor also must comply with the FDA's advertising and promotion requirements, such as the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product's approved labeling (known as "off-label use"). The FDA may take enforcement action against a company for promoting unapproved uses of a product or for other violations of its advertising and labeling laws and regulations. Enforcement actions may include product seizures, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties or regulatory letters, which may require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals.

## Government Advocacy

We engage in public policy advocacy with policymakers and continue to work to demonstrate that our therapeutic products provide value to patients and to those who pay for health care. We advocate with government policymakers to encourage a long-term approach to sustainable health care financing that ensures access to innovative medicines and does not disproportionately target FDA-regulated medical devices and biologics as a source of budget savings. In markets with historically low rates of health care spending, we encourage those governments to increase their investments and adopt market reforms in order to improve their citizens' access to appropriate health care.

## Regulations Governing Reimbursement/Fraud and Abuse

Within the United States, our products and our customers are subject to extensive regulation by a wide range of federal and state agencies. These agencies regulate the coverage and reimbursement of our products, and prohibit activities that might result in fraud and abuse. Internationally, other governments also impose regulations in connection with their health care reimbursement programs and the delivery of health care items and services.

U.S. federal health care fraud and abuse laws generally apply to our activities because our products are covered under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. The principal U.S. federal health care fraud and abuse laws applicable to us and our activities include: (1) the AntiKickback Statute, which prohibits the knowing and willful offer, solicitation, payment or receipt of anything of value in order to generate business reimbursable by a federal health care program; (2) the False Claims Act, which prohibits the submission of false or otherwise improper claims for payment to a federally-funded health care program, including claims resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute; and (3) health care fraud statutes that prohibit false statements and improper claims to any third-party payer.

The Anti-Kickback Statute is particularly relevant because of its broad applicability. Specifically, the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for, or to induce, either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for or recommending a good or service for which payment may be made in whole or part under federal health care programs, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Almost any financial interaction with a healthcare provider, patient or customer will implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute. Statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protect certain interactions if specific requirements are met. However, only those interactions that represent fair market value exchanges generally are protected by a safe harbor or exception. The government can exercise enforcement discretion in taking action against unprotected activities. Many types of interactions in which we commonly engage, such as customer support services, could implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute, are not protected by a safe harbor or exception and have been the subject of government scrutiny and enforcement action when not structured appropriately. If the government determines that these activities are abusive, we could be subject to enforcement action. Other companies that manufacture wound care products have been subject to government scrutiny and enforcement action. For example, in early 2017, Shire Pharmaceuticals LLC and other subsidiaries of Shire plc agreed to pay $350 million to settle federal and state False Claims Act allegations that Shire and the company that Shire acquired in 2011, Advanced BioHealing, employed kickbacks and other unlawful methods to induce clinics and physicians to use or overuse its product Dermagraft (a product we subsequently acquired). Penalties for Anti-Kickback Statute violations may include both criminal penalties such as imprisonment and civil sanctions such as fines and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health care programs. Exclusion would mean that our products would no longer be eligible for reimbursement under federal healthcare programs.

There are similar state false claims, anti-kickback, and insurance laws that apply to state-funded Medicaid and other health care programs as well as to commercial third-party payers. Insurance companies may also bring a private cause of action for treble damages against a manufacturer for a pattern of causing false claims to be filed under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO. In addition, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, may be used to prosecute companies in the United States for arrangements with physicians, or other parties outside the United States if the physician or party is a government official of another country and the arrangement violates the laws of that country.

In addition to receiving scrutiny and providing potential grounds for action under the Anti-Kickback Statute, pricing, sales and marketing practices of medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers are also subject to tightly focused regulation at the federal and state levels. Federal law and regulation, for example, establish pricing methodologies for government health insurance programs and requires regular reporting of sales information to CMS in support of manufacturer price calculations. In recent years, the federal government and a growing number of states have introduced new drug price transparency requirements that can require extensive

## Table of Contents

information disclosures to agencies or potential purchasers relating to drug price increases. Health care laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers; require pharmaceutical and medical device companies to comply with voluntary compliance standards issued by industry associations and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government; and/or require disclosure to the government and/or public of financial interactions (so-called "sunshine laws"). Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Manufacturers must adopt reasonable interpretations of requirements if there is ambiguity and those interpretations could be challenged. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our activities could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations.

The healthcare laws and regulations applicable to us, including those described above, are subject to evolving interpretations and enforcement discretion. If a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil financial penalties, including, for example, exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by Medicare or Medicaid. Any failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to reimbursement and health care goods and services could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and cash flows. To help ensure compliance with the laws and regulations governing the provision of health care goods and services, we have implemented a comprehensive compliance program based on the HHS Office of Inspector General's Seven Elements of an Effective Compliance Program. Despite our compliance program, we cannot be certain that we have always operated in full compliance with all applicable healthcare laws.

Our profitability and operations are subject to risks relating to changes in legislative, regulatory, and reimbursement policies and decisions as well as changes to private payer reimbursement coverage and payment decisions and policies. Implementation of further legislative or administrative reforms to reimbursement systems, or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of these systems in coverage or reimbursement, could significantly reduce reimbursement or result in the denial of coverage, which could have an impact on the acceptance of and demand for our products and the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them.

## Seasonality

Revenues during our fourth quarter tend to be stronger than other quarters because many hospitals increase their purchases of our products during the fourth quarter to coincide with the end of their budget cycles in the United States. Satisfaction of patient deductibles through the course of the year also results in increased revenues later in the year. In general, our first quarter usually has lower revenues than the preceding fourth quarter, the second and third quarters have higher revenues than the first quarter, and the fourth quarter revenues are the highest in the year.

## Human Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 950 employees worldwide. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe our employee relations are good.

In managing our business, we focus on a number of measures and objectives with respect to the attraction, development and retention of our employees that we believe are important to our business, including diversity, communication, compensation, tenure, professional development, and health, well-being and safety:

- · We are proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We seek to attract a diverse slate of candidates, including from historically underrepresented groups. We believe that diversity and inclusion in the workplace enhance employee engagement and stimulate innovation, and that people in diverse groups work better, share information more broadly and consider a wider range of views. We pride ourselves

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

## Table of Contents

- on our diverse workforce, which we believe has been and will continue to be a major contributor to our growth and innovation, and intend to continue to make diversity and inclusion a focus of our efforts regarding our workforce.
- · We aim to maintain an "open door" culture, and encourage employees to voice their concerns, questions, suggestions and comments. We strive to foster an atmosphere where employees openly share ideas and where people are treated with dignity and respect. Our goal is to provide a productive working environment based on mutual respect and the highest level of ethical and lawful conduct. We have also established a hotline for employees to report suspected violations of law and concerns related to accounting, auditing and ethical violations.
- · We provide our employees a competitive wage and evaluate our compensation programs to ensure that our employees are paid fairly for the valuable work they are doing. We are also committed to achieving internal pay equity and rewarding outstanding performance. We offer our employees competitive benefits and are proud that we have not raised employee contributions to our healthcare benefits for 6 years running.
- · We aim to foster a culture where learning is continuous, and we strive to promote from within. We believe in our people and their ability to accept new responsibilities and challenges and to grow with us to contribute to our success. Growth is fostered through professional development and learning programs as well as practical experience. Employees receive regular performance reviews to support their progress and development.
- · We recognize the benefits of a healthy workforce and offer our employees the opportunity to participate in wellness activities and programs throughout the year. We also support the mental health of our employees by offering an employee assistance program for employees and their families that provides free counseling sessions and offers other resources for employees. Additionally, our healthcare benefit allows for reimbursement for fitness and weight loss programs.
- · We prioritize the health and safety of our employees. Guided by an Environmental Health & Safety manual that is regularly reviewed, we have a dedicated Environmental Health and Safety team, who seek to prevent and reduce workplace risks and injuries through various programs, training, projects, services, and assistance, such as ergonomic evaluation, hazard reporting, risk assessment, and first aid training. We require all work-related injuries or illnesses to be reported. This information is reviewed bi-monthly by our Safety Committee for analysis and trending.
- · We are committed to maintaining and improving the safety of our employees and our workplace. For example, we have taken a number of steps to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our employees, including continuing to pay employees impacted by the pandemic, avoiding layoffs, and implementing changes to how we manufacture our products and to other processes in order to prioritize the health and safety of our employees and to operate under the protocols mandated by local and state authorities, with measures such as changes to shift schedules, physical distancing, contact tracing, symptom assessments and other safety measures. We will continue to assess, identify and implement measures to support the health and safety of our employees during the pandemic.

## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

## Summary of Risk Factors

Below is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our Class A common stock speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks that we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary, and other risks that we face, can be found below under the heading "Risk Factors" and should be carefully considered, together with other information in this Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC before making an investment decision regarding our Class A common stock.

- · Our operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control.
- · We have incurred significant losses since our inception and, while we reported positive net income in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, we may incur losses in the future.
- · Our success will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for the costs of our products and related services will be available from government payers, private health insurers and other third-party payers and we do not know whether such reimbursement will be available or, if such reimbursement is available, the rate at which it will be available. The rate of reimbursement and coverage for the use of our products has been and may continue to be unstable, unpredictable and subject to changes in government and private payer policies that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Currently, not all of our products are covered by all payers.
- · Many existing and potential customers for our products are members of GPOs and/or IDNs, including accountable care organizations or public-based purchasing organizations, and our business is partly dependent on major contracts with these organizations. Cost-containment efforts of our customers, GPOs, IDNs, third-party payers and governmental organizations could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
- · Medicare, which is the major source of revenue for most of our customers, reimburses the same amounts for most of our products and the products of our competitors targeting the same indications in the hospital outpatient setting. Because in some sites of care the reimbursement amount is not based on the cost we charge our customers for our products or the cost our competitors charge for products targeting the same indication, our customers may elect to use products cheaper than ours in order to increase their margins, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
- · As of January 1, 2022, we must report ASP for all our products. The first ASP report will be made on or before April 30, 2022 for Q1 2022. If we do not report ASP or if we incorrectly report ASP, we may have to restate ASP for prior quarters or may face penalties, including statutory and regulatory sanctions.
- · The COVID-19 pandemic has reduced the ability of some hospitals to care fornon-emergent patients. Additional surges in COVID patients may limit hospital capacity to furnish services using our products.
- · We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and our management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective. While we have successfully remediated certain of the internal control deficiencies that were included in the aggregation of the previously reported material weakness, we are continuing to work on remediating the remaining internal control deficiencies, as well as other internal control deficiencies identified during the current period, that collectively are aggregating to form the material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting that exists as of December 31, 2021. However, we cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not occur in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.
- · We face significant and continuing competition, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

## Table of Contents

- · Rapid technological change could cause our products to become obsolete and if we do not enhance our product offerings through our research and development efforts, we may be unable to effectively compete.
- · To be commercially successful, we must convince physicians that our products are safe and effective alternatives to existing treatments and that our products should be used in their procedures.
- · Our failure to comply with regulatory obligations could result in negative effects on our business.
- · The FDA may determine that certain of our products that are, or are derived from, human cells or tissues, such as Affinity and NuShield, do not qualify for regulation solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Services Act, or PHSA. To the extent that any of these products are deemed not to be HCT/Ps or Section 361 HCT/Ps, the FDA may require that we revise our labeling and marketing claims for these products or that we suspend sales of such products until FDA approval is obtained, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
- · The FDA may determine that our suspension of NuCel and ReNu commercialization on May 31, 2021 was not conducted in a timely or otherwise proper manner. To the extent that our suspension of any of these products is determined not to comply with the 361 HCT/P Guidance, we may be subject to regulatory sanctions, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
- · Because we depend upon a limited group of suppliers and manufacturers for our Apligraf, Affinity, Dermagraft and NuShield products, we may incur significant product development costs or experience material delivery delays if there is an interruption in supply from any one of these suppliers or manufacturers, which could materially impact sales of our products.
- · We are dependent on the proper functioning of our and third-party manufacturing facilities, our supply chain and our sales force, all of which could be negatively impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors, in a manner that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
- · Uncertainty and adverse changes in the general economic conditions, including inflation, may negatively affect our business.
- · Significant disruptions of our information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
- · Our patents and other intellectual property rights may not adequately protect our products.
- · We engage in transactions with related parties and the transactions present possible conflicts of interest that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
- · On May 6, 2021, we ceased to qualify as a "controlled company" within the meaning of the Nasdaq rules. Although we are no longer a controlled company, during the phase-in period we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that provide protection to stockholders of other Nasdaq listed companies.

## Risk Factors

You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as overall U.S. and non-U.S. economic and industry conditions including a global economic slowdown, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business operations and liquidity.

## Risks Related to Organogenesis and its business

## Our operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control.

We are subject to the following factors, among others, that may negatively affect our operating results:

- · the announcement or introduction of new products by our competitors;
- · failure of government healthcare programs and private health plans to cover our products or to timely and adequately reimburse the users of our products;
- · the rate of reimbursement by government and private insurers for use of our products;
- · any change in Medicare payment policy which provides a competitive advantage to our competitor's products;
- · any change in government healthcare programs' and private health plans' policies regarding sales and reimbursement of durable medical equipment, including a prohibition on physician-owned DME supplier entities;
- · whether our products or our competitors' products are granted pass-through reimbursement status or included in the "bundled" reimbursement structure;
- · our ability to upgrade and develop our systems and infrastructure to accommodate growth;
- · our ability to attract and retain key personnel in a timely and cost effective manner;
- · our ability to offer our wound care and surgical products and supplies using our existing sales force and distribution network;
- · the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the expansion of our business, operations and infrastructure;
- · changes in, or enactment of new laws or regulations promulgated by federal, state or local governments;
- · cost containment initiatives or policies developed by government and commercial payers that create financial incentives not to use our products;
- · our inability to demonstrate that our products are cost-effective or superior to competing products;
- · our ability to develop new products;
- · discovery of product defects during the manufacturing process;
- · initiation of a government investigation into potentialnon-compliance with laws or regulations;
- · issuance of government advisory opinions or program bulletins that could negatively affect one or more of our sales models;
- · sanctions imposed by federal or state governments due tonon-compliance with laws or regulations;
- · recall of one or more of our products by the FDA due to noncompliance with FDA requirements; and
- · general economic conditions as well as economic conditions specific to the healthcare industry.

We have based our current and future expense levels largely on our investment plans and estimates of future events, although certain of our expense levels are, to a large extent, fixed. We may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall. Accordingly, any significant shortfall in revenue relative to our planned expenditures would have an immediate adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, as a strategic response to changes in the competitive environment or to changes in laws and regulations, we may from time to time make certain pricing, service or marketing decisions

## Table of Contents

(e.g., reduce prices) that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Due to the foregoing factors, our revenue and operating results are and will remain difficult to forecast.

## We have incurred significant losses since our inception, and may incur losses in the future.

To date, we have financed our operations primarily through debt and equity financings, and, with the exception of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, in which we reported net income of $94.9 million and $17.2 million, we have incurred losses from operations in many years since our inception. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $60.1 million. We expect to incur significant sales and marketing costs as we expand our operations to support the sale of our products. Our prior losses, combined with any potential future losses, may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, and our management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective. While we have successfully remediated certain of the internal control deficiencies that were included in the aggregation of the previously reported material weakness, we are continuing to work on remediating the remaining internal control deficiencies, as well as other internal control deficiencies identified during the current period, that collectively are aggregating to form the material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting that exists as of December 31, 2021. However, we cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies will not occur in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.

We have historically had a small internal accounting and finance staff. This lack of adequate accounting resources and turnover in our staff has resulted in the identification of a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. A "material weakness" is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.

As disclosed in the Company's annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, our management team identified the following material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting: we did not design and maintain formal accounting, business operations, and information technology policies, procedures and controls to achieve complete, accurate and timely financial accounting, reporting and disclosures, including (i) formalized policies and procedures for reviews over account reconciliations, journal entries, and other accounting analyses and memos and procedures to ensure completeness and accuracy of information used in these review controls and (ii) controls to support the objectives of proper segregation of the initiation of transactions, the recording of transactions, and the custody of assets.

Although we have made significant progress in remediating this material weakness, we concluded that the material weakness described above continued to exist as of December 31, 2021. Specifically, when validating the operating effectiveness of certain controls over financial reporting to gain assurance that such controls are present and functioning as designed, management identified deficiencies that indicate a lack of sustainability and inconsistent application of certain policies, procedures, and controls, including the proper segregation of duties, exacerbated in part by turnover within key positions during the year. We plan to continue to take additional steps to remediate the material weakness and improve our financial reporting systems and implement new policies, procedures and controls as described in Item 9A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If we do not successfully remediate the material weakness described above, or if other material weaknesses or other deficiencies arise in the future, we may be unable to accurately report our financial results, which could cause our financial results to be materially misstated and require restatement.

## Table of Contents

## Rapid technological change could cause our products to become obsolete and if we do not enhance our product offerings through our research and development efforts, we may be unable to effectively compete.

The technologies underlying our products are subject to rapid and profound technological change. Competition intensifies as technical advances in each field are made and become more widely known. We can give no assurance that others will not develop services, products, or processes with significant advantages over the products, services, and processes that we offer or are seeking to develop. Any such occurrence could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We plan to enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing customer demands and competitive pressure and technologies, but we may not be successful. The success of any new product offering or enhancement to an existing product will depend on numerous factors, including our ability to:

- · properly identify and anticipate physician and patient needs;
- · develop and introduce new products or product enhancements in a timely manner;
- · adequately protect our intellectual property and avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties;
- · demonstrate the safety and efficacy of new products, including through the conduct of additional clinical trials;
- · obtain the necessary regulatory clearances or approvals for new products or product enhancements;
- · achieve adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products; and
- · compete successfully against other skin substitutes and other modalities for treating wounds such as negative-pressure wound therapy and hyperbaric oxygen.

If we do not develop and, when necessary, obtain regulatory clearance or approval for new products or product enhancements in time to meet market demand, or if there is insufficient demand for these products or enhancements, our results of operations will suffer. Our research and development efforts may require a substantial investment of time and resources before we are adequately able to determine the commercial viability of a new product, technology, material or other innovation. In addition, even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products, these enhancements or new generations of products may not be covered or reimbursed by government healthcare programs such as Medicare or private health plans, may not produce sales in excess of the costs of development and/or may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features.

## To be commercially successful, we must convince physicians that our products are safe and effective alternatives to existing treatments and that our products should be used in their procedures.

We believe physicians will only adopt our products if they determine, based on experience, clinical data and published peer-reviewed journal articles, that the use of our products in a particular procedure is a favorable alternative to conventional methods. Physicians also are more interested in using costeffective products and may practice in settings like Accountable Care Organizations, or ACOs, or Medical Homes, where they face considerable costcontainment pressure. In general, physicians may be slow to change their medical treatment practices and use of our products for the following reasons, among others:

- · their lack of experience using our products;
- · lack of evidence supporting additional patient benefits from use of our products over conventional methods;
- · pressure to contain costs;

## Table of Contents

- · preference for other treatment modalities or our competitors' products;
- · perceived liability risks generally associated with the use of new products and procedures;
- · limited availability of coverage and/or reimbursement from third-party payers; and
- · the time that must be dedicated to training.

The degree of market acceptance of our products will continue to depend on a number of factors, including:

- · the safety and efficacy of our products;
- · the potential and perceived advantages of our products over alternative treatments;
- · clinical data and the clinical indications for which our products are approved;
- · product labeling or product insert requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities, including any limitations or warnings contained in approved labeling;
- · the cost of, and relative reimbursement rate for, using our products relative to the use of our competitors' products or alternative treatment modalities;
- · relative convenience and ease of administration;
- · the strength of marketing and distribution support;
- · the quality of the service and support provided to our customers;
- · the timing of market introduction of competitive products;
- · publicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments;
- · our reputation and the reputation of the products;
- · the shelf life of our products and our ability to manage the logistics of theend-user supply chain; and
- · sufficient and readily accessible third-party insurance coverage and reimbursement.

In addition, we are currently conducting clinical studies for some of our products that were brought to market as 361 HCT/Ps to generate efficacy data in various clinical applications. Unfavorable results from these 361 HCT/P clinical trials such as lack of clinical efficacy or serious treatment-related side effects could negatively affect the use and adoption of our products by physicians and hospitals, thereby compromising our market acceptance.

We believe recommendations for, and support of our products by, influential physicians are essential for market acceptance and adoption. If we do not receive this support (e.g., because we are unable to demonstrate favorable long-term clinical data), physicians and hospitals may not use our products, which would significantly reduce our ability to achieve expected revenue and would prevent us from sustaining profitability.

In the course of conducting our business, we must comply with regulatory quality requirements, adequately address quality issues that may arise with our products, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. Although we have established internal procedures to minimize risks that may arise from quality issues, we may not be able to eliminate or mitigate these risks and quality issues may arise in which case we would be subject to liability. If the quality of our products does not meet the expectations of regulators, physicians or patients, then we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and our brand and reputation could suffer and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.

## Table of Contents

## We face the risk of product liability claims and may not be able to obtain or maintain adequate product liability insurance.

Our business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims that are inherent in the manufacturing, processing, investigating and marketing of medical devices and human tissue products. We are, and may in the future be, subject to product liability claims and lawsuits, including potential class actions or mass tort claims, alleging that our products have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition or injury. Product liability claims may be made by patients and their families, healthcare providers or others selling our products. Defending a lawsuit, regardless of merit, could be costly, divert management attention and result in adverse publicity, which could result in the withdrawal of, or reduced acceptance of, our products in the market. If we cannot successfully defend against product liability claims, we could incur substantial liability and costs. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:

- · harm to our business reputation;
- · investigations by regulators;
- · significant defense costs;
- · distraction of management's attention from our primary business;
- · substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;
- · loss of revenue;
- · exhaustion of any available insurance and our capital resources; and
- · decreased demand for our products.

Although we have product liability insurance that we believe is adequate, this insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations and we may not be able to maintain this insurance. Also, it is possible that claims could exceed the limits of our coverage or be excluded from coverage under our policy. If we are unable to maintain product liability insurance at an acceptable cost or on acceptable terms with adequate coverage or otherwise protect ourselves against potential product liability claims or we underestimate the amount of insurance we need, we could be exposed to significant liabilities, which may harm our business. One or more product liability claims could cause our stock price to decline and, if our liability exceeds our insurance coverage, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

## Interruptions in the supply of our products or inventory loss may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our products are manufactured using technically complex processes requiring specialized facilities, highly specific raw materials and other production constraints. The complexity of these processes, as well as strict company and government standards for the manufacture and storage of our products, subjects us to production risks. In addition to ongoing production risks, process deviations or unanticipated effects of approved process changes may result in non-compliance with regulatory requirements including stability requirements or specifications. Most of our products must be stored and transported within a specified temperature range. For example, if environmental conditions deviate from that range, our products' remaining shelf-lives could be impaired or their safety and efficacy could be adversely affected, making them unsuitable for use. These deviations may go undetected. The occurrence of actual or suspected production and distribution problems can lead to lost inventories, and in some cases recalls, with consequential reputational damage and the risk of product liability. The investigation and remediation of any identified problems can cause production delays and result in substantial additional expenses. Production of our Affinity product, for example, was suspended in the first quarter of 2019 due to production issues at one of our suppliers. As a result, we identified an alternate supplier, and were only able to resume commercial-scale production in the second quarter of 2020. Subsequently, we have added a second source to provide additional capacity and redundancy in supply. This disruption in supply

## Table of Contents

resulted in reduced Affinity revenue. Although we were able to partially offset the lost Affinity revenue by increasing production of our other products, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the event of any future suspensions or failures in the storage or manufacturing of Affinity, Dermagraft or our other products. Any future failure in the storage or manufacture of our products or loss in supply could result in a loss of our market share and negatively affect our revenues and operations.

As noted above, as part of our long-term plan to consolidate manufacturing operations in Massachusetts, manufacturing of Dermagraft was suspended in the fourth quarter of 2021 and sales of Dermagraft will be suspended in the second quarter of 2022. We plan to transition our Dermagraft manufacturing to our Massachusetts-based manufacturing facilities, which we expect will result in substantial long-term cost savings. In the period when Dermagraft is not available (possibly for a few years), we expect that customers will be willing to substitute Apligraf for Dermagraft and that the suspension of Dermagraft sales will not have a material impact on our net revenue. However, if we do not realize the expected substantial long-term cost savings or if customers are unwilling to substitute Apligraf for Dermagraft during the period in which Dermagraft is unavailable, it could have an adverse effect on our net revenue and results of operations.

## Because we depend upon a limited group of suppliers and manufacturers for our products, including our NuShield, Affinity, Apligraf, PuraPly Antimicrobial and Dermagraft products, we may incur significant product development costs and experience material delivery delays if we lose any significant supplier, which could materially impact sales of our products.

We obtain some of the components for our products from a limited group of suppliers. For us to be successful, our suppliers must be able to provide us with these components in substantial quantities, in compliance with regulatory requirements, in accordance with agreed-upon specifications, at acceptable costs and on a timely basis. Our efforts to maintain a continuity of supply and high quality and reliability may not be successful. Manufacturing disruptions experienced by our suppliers may jeopardize our supply of these components. Due to the stringent regulations and requirements of the FDA regarding the manufacture of our products, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials. A change in suppliers could require significant effort or investment in circumstances where the items supplied are integral to product performance or incorporate unique technology. A reduction or interruption in manufacturing (including the current suspension of Dermagraft manufacturing pending its transition to our Massachusetts based manufacturing facilities), or an inability to secure alternative sources of raw materials or components, could have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, one or more of our suppliers may refuse to extend us credit with respect to our purchasing or leasing equipment, supplies, products or components, or may only agree to extend us credit on significantly less favorable terms or subject to more onerous conditions. This could significantly disrupt our ability to purchase or lease required equipment, supplies, products and components in a costeffective and timely manner and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Any casualty, natural disaster or other disruption of any of our sole-source suppliers' operations, or any unexpected loss of any existing exclusive supply contract, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

## Our products are dependent on the availability of tissue from human donors, and any disruption in supply could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Many of the products that we manufacture require that we obtain human tissue. The success of our business depends upon, among other factors, the availability of tissue from human donors. Any failure to obtain tissue from our sources will interfere with our ability to effectively meet the demand for our products incorporating human tissue. The processing of human tissue for our products is very labor-intensive and it is therefore difficult to maintain a steady supply stream. The availability of donated tissue could also be adversely impacted by regulatory changes, public opinion of the donor process as well as our own reputation in the industry. The challenges we may face in obtaining adequate supplies of human tissue involve several risks, including limited

## Table of Contents

control over the availability, quality and delivery schedules. In addition, any interruption in the supply of any human tissue component could materially harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply, if any, could be found. We may be unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable time period or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

## Increased prices for, or unavailability of, raw materials used in our products could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our profitability is affected by the prices of the raw materials used in the manufacture of our products. These prices may fluctuate based on a number of factors beyond our control, including changes in supply and demand, general economic conditions, labor costs, fuel-related delivery costs, competition, import duties, excises and other indirect taxes, currency exchange rates, and government regulation. Due to the highly competitive nature of the healthcare industry and the cost containment efforts of our customers and third-party payers, we may be unable to pass along cost increases for key components or raw materials through higher prices to our customers. If the cost of key components or raw materials increases, and we are unable fully to recover these increased costs through price increases or offset these increases through other cost reductions, we could experience lower margins and profitability. Significant increases in the prices of raw materials, due to inflation or otherwise, that cannot be recovered through productivity gains, price increases or other methods could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

## We continue to invest significant capital in expanding our internal sales force, and there can be no assurance that these efforts will result in significant increases in sales.

We are committed to building and further expanding our internal sales and marketing capabilities, including the expansion of our sales force to support the marketing and sales of the products acquired in connection with our 2017 acquisition of NuTech Medical and our 2020 acquisition of CPN Biosciences. As a result, we continue to invest in a direct sales force for our products to allow us to reach new customers and potentially increase sales. These expenses impact our operating results, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in significantly expanding the sales of our products.

The impairment or termination of our relationships with independent sales agencies, whom we do not control, could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and profits. We intend to develop additional relationships with independent sales agencies in order to increase revenue from certain of our products; our inability to do so may prevent us from increasing sales.

We derive a portion of our revenues through our relationships with independent sales agencies. The impairment or termination of these relationships for any reason could materially and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and profits. Because the independent sales agency often controls the customer relationships within its territory, there is a risk that if our relationship with the independent sales agency ends, our relationship with the customer will be lost. Also, because we do not control an independent sales agency's field sales agents, there is a risk we will be unable to ensure that our sales processes, regulatory compliance, and other priorities will be consistently communicated and executed by the distributor. If we fail to maintain relationships with our key independent sales agencies, or fail to ensure that our independent sales agencies adhere to our sales processes, regulatory compliance, and other priorities, this could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We may have liability for the actions of independent sales agencies in marketing our products and our lack of control over their activities impedes our ability to prevent, detect or address such non-compliance.

We intend to develop relationships and arrangements with additional independent sales agencies in order to increase our sales with respect to certain of our products. However, we may fail to develop such relationships, in which case we may not be able to increase our sales. Our success is partially dependent upon our ability to retain and motivate our independent sales agencies and their representatives to sell our products in certain territories.

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

## Table of Contents

They may not be successful in implementing our marketing plans. Some of our independent sales agencies may not sell our products exclusively and may offer similar products from other companies. Our independent sales agencies may terminate their contracts with us, may devote insufficient sales efforts to our products, or may focus their sales efforts on other products that produce greater commissions for them, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We also may not be able to find additional independent sales agencies who will agree to market and/or distribute those products on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to establish new independent sales agency relationships or renew current sales agency agreements on commercially acceptable terms, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, because we do not control these independent sales agencies as closely as our employees, while we may take steps to mitigate the risks associated with noncompliance by independent sales agencies, there remains a risk they do not comply with regulatory requirements or our requirements or our policies which could also adversely affect our business.

## We will need to continue to expand our organization, and managing growth may be more difficult than expected.

Managing our growth may be more difficult than we expect. We anticipate that a period of significant expansion will be required to penetrate and service the markets for our existing and anticipated future products and to continue to develop new products. This expansion will place a significant strain on management, operational and financial resources. To manage the expected growth of our operations and personnel, we must both modify our existing operational and financial systems, procedures and controls and implement new systems, procedures and controls. We must also expand our finance, administrative, and operations staff. Management may be unable to hire, train, retain, motivate and manage necessary personnel or to identify, manage and exploit existing and potential strategic relationships and market opportunities.

In addition to expanding our organization, we are expanding our manufacturing capabilities, which requires significant capital expenditures. If these capital expenditures are higher than expected, it may adversely affect our financial condition and capital resources. In addition, if the expansion of our manufacturing facilities is delayed, for regulatory or other reasons, it may limit our ability to expand the size of our organization and to meet our corporate goals. Even if we are able to expand our manufacturing facilities as we plan, we may not realize the full expected benefit of our investment.

## We may expand our business through acquisitions, similar to our acquisitions of NuTech Medical and CPN Biosciences, licenses, investments, and other commercial arrangements in other companies or technologies. Such acquisitions or commercial arrangements may entail significant risks.

We periodically evaluate strategic opportunities to acquire companies, divisions, technologies, products, and rights through licenses, distribution agreements, investments, and outright acquisitions to grow our business, such as our acquisitions of NuTech Medical and CPN Biosciences. In connection with one or more of those transactions, we may:

- · issue additional equity securities that would dilute our stockholders' value;
- · use cash that we may need in the future to operate our business;
- · incur debt that could have terms unfavorable to us or that we might be unable to repay;
- · structure the transaction in a manner that has unfavorable tax consequences, such as a stock purchase that does not permit astep-up in the tax basis for the assets acquired;
- · be unable to realize the anticipated benefits, such as increased revenues, cost savings, or synergies from additional sales of existing or newly acquired products;
- · be unable to successfully integrate, operate, maintain and manage our newly acquired operations;
- · divert management's attention from the existing business to integrate, operate, maintain and manage our newly acquired operations and personnel;

## Table of Contents

- · acquire unknown liabilities that could subject us to government investigations and/or litigation or other actions that make it impossible to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction;
- · be unable to secure the services of key employees related to the acquisition; and
- · be unable to succeed in the marketplace with the acquisition.

Any of these items could materially and adversely affect our revenues, financial condition, and profitability. Business acquisitions also involve the risk of unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business, which could be material. Our acquisition of NuTech Medical and CPN Biosciences expanded our wound care portfolio and our acquisition of NuTech Medical broadened our addressable market to include the Surgical & Sports Medicine market. We may not realize the increased revenues, cost savings and synergies that we anticipate from this acquisition in the near term or at all due to many factors, including delays in the integration process, an inability to successfully penetrate the amniotic category of the wound care market or an inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals. Additional liabilities related to acquisitions could include a lack of compliance with government regulations that could subject us to investigation and civil and criminal sanctions. For example, we may acquire a company that was not compliant with FDA quality requirements or was making payments or other forms of remuneration to physicians to induce them to use their products. Incurring unknown liabilities or the failure to realize the anticipated benefits of an acquisition could materially and adversely affect our business and we may lose our entire investment or be unable to recover our initial investment, which could include the cost of acquiring licenses or distribution rights, acquiring products, purchasing initial inventory, or investments in early-stage companies. Inability to recover our investment, or any write off of such investment, associated goodwill, or assets, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

## New lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks.

From time to time, we may implement or may acquire new lines of business, such as our Surgical & Sports Medicine products that were acquired in connection with our acquisition of NuTech Medical, or we may offer new products and services within existing lines of business. There are risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed or are evolving. In developing and marketing new lines of business and new products and services, we may invest significant time and resources. External factors, such as regulatory compliance obligations, competitive alternatives, lack of market acceptance, and shifting market preferences, may also affect the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

## Significant disruptions of information technology systems or breaches of information security could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We rely to a large extent upon sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business. In the ordinary course of business, we collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information (including, but not limited to, personal information and intellectual property). We also have outsourced significant elements of our operations to third parties, including significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and, as a result, we are managing many independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information. The size and complexity of our information technology and information security systems, and those of our third-party vendors with whom we contract (and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them), make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees or vendors, or from malicious attacks by third parties. Such attacks are of ever-increasing levels of sophistication and are made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives (including, but not limited to, industrial espionage and market manipulation) and expertise. While we have invested significantly in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions or security

## Table of Contents

breaches. For example, in August 2020, our information technology ("IT") systems were exposed to a ransomware attack, which partially impaired certain IT systems for a short period of time. We finished investigating the incident, together with legal counsel and other incident response professionals. We did not experience any material losses related to the ransomware attack and were able to recover all data quickly, with only a minimal and temporary interruption to our business. While we have implemented measures to protect our data security and information technology systems, such measures may not prevent these events. Although we have cyber-insurance coverage that may cover certain events described above, this insurance is subject to deductibles and coverage limitations and we may not be able to maintain this insurance. Also, it is possible that claims could exceed the limits of our coverage. Any interruption or breach in our systems could adversely affect our business operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive confidential information or intellectual property, and could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us or allow third parties to gain material, inside information that they use to trade in our securities.

## If a breach of our measures protecting personal data covered by HIPAA, the HITECH Act, or the CCPA occurs, we may incur significant liabilities.

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, and the regulations that have been issued under it, impose certain obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of protected health information. The requirements and restrictions apply to "covered entities" (which include health care providers and insurers) as well as to their business associates that receive protected health information from them in order to provide services to or perform certain activities on their behalf. The statute and regulations also impose notification obligations on covered entities and their business associates in the event of a breach of the privacy or security of protected health information. We occasionally receive protected health information from our customers in the course of our business. As such, we believe that we are business associates and therefore subject to HIPAA's requirements and restrictions with respect to handling such protected health information, and have executed business associate agreements with certain customers.

In addition, California has enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), which came into effect on January 1, 2020. Pursuant to the CCPA, certain businesses are required, among other things, to make certain enhanced disclosures related to California residents regarding the use or disclosure of their personal information, allow California residents to opt-out of certain uses and disclosures of their personal information without penalty, provide Californians with other choices related to personal data in our possession, and obtain opt-in consent before engaging in certain uses of personal information relating to Californians under the age of 16. The California Attorney General may seek substantial monetary penalties and injunctive relief in the event of our non-compliance with the CCPA. The CCPA also allows for private lawsuits from Californians in the event of certain data breaches. Aspects of the CCPA remain uncertain, and we may be required to make modifications to our policies or practices in order to comply.

It is possible the data protection laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. If so, this could result in government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, these privacy regulations may differ from country to country and state to state, and may vary based on whether testing is performed in the United States or in the local country. Complying with these various laws and regulations could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business. Further, compliance with data protection laws and regulations could require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to collect, use and disclose data, or in some cases, impact our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions. We can provide no assurance that we are or will remain in compliance with diverse privacy and security requirements in all of the jurisdictions in which we do business. If we fail to comply or are deemed to have failed to comply with applicable privacy protection laws and regulations such failure could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us, which could include substantial civil and/or criminal penalties, as well as private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our operating results and business.

## Table of Contents

## We engage in transactions with related parties and such transactions present possible conflicts of interest that could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We have entered into a significant number of transactions with related parties. Related party transactions create the possibility of conflicts of interest with regard to our management, including that:

- · we may enter into contracts between us, on the one hand, and related parties, on the other, that are not as a result ofarm's-length transactions;
- · our executive officers and directors that hold positions of responsibility with related parties may be aware of certain business opportunities that are appropriate for presentation to us as well as to such other related parties and may present such business opportunities to such other parties; and
- · our executive officers and directors that hold positions of responsibility with related parties may have significant duties with, and spend significant time serving, other entities and may have conflicts of interest in allocating time.

Such conflicts could cause an executive officer or a director to seek to advance his or her economic interests or the economic interests of certain related parties above ours. Conversely, we may not be able to enter into transactions with third parties on terms as favorable as the terms of existing transactions with related parties. Further, the appearance of conflicts of interest created by related party transactions could impair the confidence of our investors. It is possible that a conflict of interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

## Our financial performance may be adversely affected by medical device tax provisions in healthcare reform laws.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the "PPACA") imposed, among other things, an excise tax of 2.3% on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States. Under these provisions, the Congressional Research Service predicted that the total cost to the medical device industry may be up to $20 billion over a decade. The Internal Revenue Service issued final regulations implementing the tax in December 2012, which required, among other things, bi-monthly payments and quarterly reporting. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 (Pub. L. 114-113), signed into law in December 2015, included atwo-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax. A secondtwo-year moratorium on the medical device excise tax was signed into law in January 2018 as part of the Extension of Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 (Pub. L. 115-120), extending the moratorium through December 31, 2019. On December 20, 2019, President Trump signed into law a permanent repeal of the medical device tax under the PPACA, but there is no guarantee that Congress or the President will not reverse course in the future. If such an excise tax on sales of our products in the United States is enacted, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

## We could incur asset impairment charges related to certain leasehold improvements, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our long-term assets include property, plant and equipment of $79.2 million and $55.8 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the asset is written down to fair value, which is determined based on appraised value. Any such impairment could result in a non-cash charge equal to the full value of these improvements. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we did not recognize an impairment charge in relation to these leasehold improvements. Changes in our assumptions with respect to our expected use of these assets may result in an impairment charge in the future, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

## Table of Contents

## We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings if our goodwill and other amortizable intangible assets, or other investments become impaired.

We are required under generally accepted accounting principles to test goodwill for impairment at least annually and to review our goodwill, amortizable intangible assets, and other assets acquired through merger and acquisition activity, for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill, amortizable intangible assets, and other assets acquired via acquisitions include significant adverse changes in the business climate and actual or projected operating results (affecting our company as a whole or affecting any particular segment) and declines in the financial condition of our business. We may be required in the future to record additional charges to earnings if our goodwill, amortizable intangible assets or other investments become impaired. Any such charge would adversely impact our financial results.

## Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to certain limitations.

As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $103.6 million of federal net operating loss carry-forwards available for the reduction of future years' federal taxable income, of which $45.1 million will expire from the year ended December 31, 2021 through 2037 and $58.5 million can be carried forward indefinitely. Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, the deductibility of $58.5 million of this net operating loss-carry-forward as of December 31, 2021 and all future net operating loss-carry-forwards is limited to 80% of taxable income, limiting or delaying in part the use of net operating loss-carry-forwards. As of December 31, 2021, we also had state net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $25.4 million expiring from the year ended December 31, 2021 through 2039. It is uncertain whether and to what extent applicable state tax laws will conform to the federal rule, though we are already subject to limitations in net operating loss utilization in certain states.

In addition, our ability to utilize our federal net operating loss carryforwards may be limited under Section 382 of the Code. In the event of an "ownership change," Section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of post-ownership change taxable income that may be offset with pre-ownership change net operating losses of the loss corporation experiencing the ownership change. An "ownership change" is defined by Section 382 as a cumulative change in ownership of our company of more than 50% within a three-year period. As of December 31, 2021, we performed a study and determined that there is no limitation on our federal net operating losses. Current or future changes in our stock ownership may trigger an "ownership change," some of which may be outside our control. Accordingly, our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards to offset federal taxable income, if any, could be limited by Section 382, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability to us.

We are dependent on the proper functioning of our and third-party manufacturing facilities, our supply chain and our sales force, all of which could be negatively impacted by the global COVID-19 pandemic, or other factors, in a manner that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Our ability to manufacture products may be materially adversely impacted by the coronavirus.

COVID-19 is continuing to impact worldwide economic activity. Estimates for economic growth have been reduced and may have a corresponding effect on our sales activity. The virus has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization and has spread globally to over 180 countries, including the United States. The impact of this pandemic has been and will likely continue to be extensive in many aspects of society, which has resulted in and will likely continue to result in significant disruptions to the global economy, as well as businesses and capital markets around the world. We, like many employers in the United States, have required (with limited exceptions) employees to work from home or not come into their offices or facilities. We manufacture our non- placental-based products and use third-party manufacturers for our placental-based products and we use third-party raw material suppliers to support our internal manufacturing processes. Our

## Table of Contents

manufacturing facilities have, thus far, remained operational as "essential" services under applicable regulatory orders. If our manufacturing capabilities or the manufacturing capabilities of our suppliers are impacted as a result of COVID-19, it may not be possible for us to timely manufacture relevant products at the required levels or at all. A reduction or interruption in any of our manufacturing processes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Further, remote work may disrupt our operations or increase the risk of a cybersecurity incident.

We also may be unable to obtain the raw materials necessary to support our internal manufacturing processes due to the additional constraints on suppliers created by COVID-19. Any delays in the delivery of these raw materials and delay manufacturing of our products may result in the cancellation of orders for our products.

In addition, the manufacture of our products is dependent on the availability of sufficient quantities of source tissue, which is the primary component of our products. Source tissue includes donated human tissue, porcine tissue and bovine tissue. We acquire donated human tissue directly through institutional review board-approved protocols at multiple hospitals, as well as through tissue procurement firms engaged by us or by our contract manufacturers. Any failure to obtain tissue from our sources, including any failures related to COVID-19, will interfere with our ability to effectively meet the demand for our products. Any interruption in the supply of source tissue could materially harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply, if any, could be found. We may be unable to find a sufficient alternative supply channel in a reasonable time period or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

## Our sales may be materially adversely impacted by the coronavirus.

Our current Advanced Wound Care portfolio is sold throughout the United States via an experienced direct sales force, which focuses its efforts on wound care in various sites of care. We use a mix of direct sales representatives and independent agencies to service the Surgical & Sports Medicine market. These sales representatives are supported by teams of professionals focused on sales management, sales operations and effectiveness, ongoing training, analytics and marketing.

Our direct sales force functions by meeting in person with physicians and health care providers to discuss ourproducts. COVID-19 may negatively affect demand for our products by limiting the ability of our sales personnel to maintain their customary contacts with physicians and health care providers. We may also find that the independent agencies that we use will have to prioritize their workload and may be forced to slow their activities as a result of COVID-19. As a result, we cannot assure you that our direct sales representatives or independent agencies will increase or maintain our current sales levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The support for our sales force may also be impacted, thereby reducing the effectiveness of our sales force.

We may also experience significant and unpredictable reductions in demand for certain of our products if patients are unable to access certain advanced therapies due to stay-at-home orders or providers prioritizing resources to addressthe COVID-19 pandemic.

The impact of COVID-19 on economic activity, and its effect on our manufacturing facilities, supply chain and sales force is uncertain at this time and could have a material adverse effect on our results, especially to the extent these effects persist or exacerbate over an extended period of time.

## Table of Contents

## Our ability to comply with financial covenants under our credit agreement and raise capital may be materially adversely impactedby COVID-19.

We have funded our operations and capital spending, in part, through third-party debt and proceeds from the sale of our Class A common stock. Our 2021 Credit Agreement requires that we comply with certain financial covenants that include Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, tested quarterly. If we are unable to meet these financial covenants due to the economic impact of COVID-19 or otherwise, the borrowings under the 2021 Credit Agreement may become due and payable immediately unless we obtain an amendment from our lenders and we would be prohibited from making any borrowings under the Revolving Facility. There can be no assurance that our lenders would agree to any such amendment on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, any sustained disruption in the capital markets from the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact our ability to raise capital from the offering of equity or debt securities.

## Risks Related to Regulation of Our Products and Other Government Regulations

## We may encounter substantial delays or difficulties in our clinical trials.

Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of our product candidates, we must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product candidates. Clinical testing is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain as to the outcome. We have limited experience with clinical trials. We cannot guarantee that any clinical trials will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. Events that may prevent successful or timely completion of clinical development include:

- · the FDA may require additional clinical trials in connection with the approval of product candidates;
- · delays in reaching a consensus with the FDA or other regulatory authorities on trial design;
- · delays in reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites;
- · delays in opening clinical trial sites or obtaining required IRB or independent ethics committee approval at each clinical trial site;
- · our decision or the requirement of regulators or IRBs to suspend or terminate clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements, a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks, or the imposition of a clinical hold as a result of a serious adverse event or after an inspection of our clinical trial operations or clinical trial sites;
- · delays in recruiting suitable patients to participate in our future clinical trials, including, but not limited to challenges associated with COVID-19;
- · failure by us, any CROs we engage or any other third parties to adhere to clinical trial or regulatory requirements;
- · failure by us, any CROs we engage or any other third parties to perform in accordance with Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, cGMPs, or applicable regulatory guidelines in the United States and other international markets;
- · failure by physicians to adhere to delivery protocols leading to variable results;
- · delays in the testing, validation, manufacturing and delivery of our product candidates to the clinical trial sites, including delays by third parties with whom we have contracted to perform certain of those functions due to COVID-19 or other reasons;
- · insufficient or inadequate supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates;

## Table of Contents

- · delays in having patients complete participation in a clinical trial or return for post-treatmentfollow-up;
- · clinical trial sites or patients dropping out of a clinical trial at a rate higher than we anticipate;
- · selection of clinical endpoints that require prolonged periods of clinical observation or analysis of the resulting data;
- · receipt of negative or inconclusive clinical trial results;
- · occurrence of serious adverse events associated with the product candidate that are viewed to outweigh its potential benefits;
- · occurrence of serious adverse events in clinical trials of the same class of agents conducted by other sponsors; and
- · changes in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols;

ReNu is in Phase 3 clinical development for the management of symptoms associated with knee OA. Our anticipated timeline for these and other trials and studies on our clinical trial candidates may be subject to delays due to factors such as those discussed above.

Any inability to successfully complete preclinical and clinical development could result in additional costs to us or impair our ability to generate revenues from product sales, regulatory, development and commercialization milestones and royalties. In addition, if we make manufacturing or formulation changes to our product candidates, we may need to conduct additional studies to bridge our modified product candidates to earlier versions. Clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

Success in research and preclinical studies or early clinical trial results may not be indicative of results obtained in later trials. Likewise, preliminary, initial or interim data from clinical trials should be considered carefully and with caution since the final data may be materially different from the preliminary, initial or interim data, particularly as more patient data become available.

Results from preclinical studies or early clinical trials, including feasibility studies, or earlier conducted clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of future clinical trial results, and interim results of a clinical trial are not necessarily indicative of final results. Our clinical trial candidates, including ReNu, may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy in clinical development despite demonstrating positive results in preclinical studies or having successfully advanced through initial or earlier clinical trials or preliminary stages of clinical trials. From time to time, we have and may in the future publish or report preliminary, initial or interim data. Preliminary, initial or interim data from our clinical trials and those of our partners may not be indicative of the final results of the trial and are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and/or more patient data become available. In this regard, such data may show initial evidence of clinical benefit, but as patients continue to be followed and more patient data becomes available, there is a risk that any therapeutic effects will not be durable in patients and/or will decrease over time, or cease entirely. Preliminary, initial or interim data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from such preliminary, initial or interim data. As a result, preliminary, initial or interim data should be considered carefully and with caution until the final data are available.

There is no guarantee that any of our clinical trials will be successful. In addition, there is a high failure rate for drugs, biologic products and cell therapies proceeding through clinical trials. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in latestage clinical trials even

## Table of Contents

after achieving promising results in preclinical testing and earlier-stage clinical trials. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities are subject to varying interpretations, which may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Any such setbacks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

## Obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals or clearances for certain of our products will be expensive and time-consuming and may impede our ability to fully exploit our technologies or otherwise limit our ability to meet other business objectives.

As biological products and medical devices, many of the products that we market require regulatory approvals or clearances from the FDA, or from similar regulatory authorities outside of the United States, before they may legally be distributed in commerce. In particular, such products may require FDA approval of Biologics License Applications, or BLAs, under Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (the "PHSA"), Premarket Approval, or PMA, submissions under Section 515 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, or may require clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA. Although we believe that we have all necessary regulatory approvals or clearances legally required for the products that we currently market, the introduction of new or modified products may require us to secure new approvals or clearances. Additionally, the FDA may take the position that some of the products that we currently market without premarket approval or clearance in fact require such approval or clearance. The process of obtaining an approved BLA or PMA requires the expenditure of substantial time, effort and financial resources and may take years to complete. Although obtaining clearance under section 510(k) is somewhat less burdensome, it is also associated with significant costs and resource commitments. The fee for filing a BLA, PMA or 510(k) notification, and the annual user fees for any establishment that manufactures biologics or medical devices, as well as product fees applicable to each approved product are substantial.

In January 2021, we announced that the first patient was enrolled in the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of ReNu for the management of symptoms associated with knee OA. There are significant costs associated with conducting clinical trials to support approvals that cannot necessarily be estimated with any accuracy until investigational plans have been developed. Moreover, data obtained from clinical activities may show a lack of safety or efficacy or may be inconclusive or susceptible to varying interpretations, any of which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Failure or delay can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful. Even product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the required safety profile or meet the efficacy endpoints despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. We cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. Even with positive clinical trial results, there may be other barriers to approval or clearance, and the FDA may not grant approval or clearance on a timely basis, or at all. Even if the FDA clears or approves our products, the clinical data submitted to the FDA may not be sufficient for payers to cover and/or adequately reimburse our customers for use of our products. Additionally, the FDA may limit the indications for use in an approval or clearance, or place other conditions on an approval, that could restrict the commercial application of the products.

## Regenerative medicine advanced therapy, or RMAT, designation for our product candidates may not lead to faster development or regulatory processes nor does it increase the likelihood that such product candidates will receive marketing approval.

RMAT was introduced as a new designation under the 21st Century Cures Act for the development and review of certain regenerative medicine therapies. To receive RMAT designation, a regenerative medicine product candidate must be intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or lifethreatening disease or condition with preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug has the potential to address the unmet medical needs. RMAT designation does not require evidence to indicate that the drug may offer a substantial improvement over available therapies, as breakthrough designation requires.

## Table of Contents

An RMAT product candidate receives intensive guidance on an efficient product development program; involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review; and a rolling review. Regenerative medicine therapies that qualify for RMAT designation may also qualify for other FDA expedited programs, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review designation, if they meet the criteria for such programs. However, RMAT designation does not assure that marketing approval will be granted and, if granted, that the approval process would be any faster than it would have otherwise been.

In January 2021, we announced RMAT designation for ReNu for the management of symptoms associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA). However, there is no guarantee that the receipt of RMAT designation will result in a faster development process, review or approval for ReNu for the management of symptoms associated with knee OA or increase the likelihood that ReNu will be granted marketing approval for the management of symptoms associated with knee OA. Likewise, any future RMAT designation or other expedited review status such as breakthrough therapy designation for any of our other product candidates neither guarantees a faster development process, review or approval nor improves the likelihood of the grant of marketing approval by FDA for any such product candidate compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures. In addition, the FDA may withdraw any RMAT or other expedited review status at any time. We may seek RMAT or breakthrough therapy designation for our other product candidates, but the FDA may not grant this status to any such product candidates.

## We may seek fast track designation by the FDA for one or more of our product candidates, but we might not receive such designation, and even if we do, such designation may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.

If a product is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the product demonstrates the potential to address unmet needs for this condition, the treatment sponsor may apply for FDA fast track designation. Even if we receive fast track designation, fast track designation does not ensure that we will receive marketing approval or that approval will be granted within any particular timeframe. We may not experience a faster development, regulatory review or approval process with fast track designation compared to conventional FDA procedures. Additionally, the FDA may withdraw fast track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program. Fast track designation alone does not guarantee qualification for the FDA's priority review procedures.

## A breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA for a product candidate may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process, and it would not increase the likelihood that the product candidate will receive marketing approval.

We may seek a breakthrough therapy designation for one or more product candidates. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a product candidate that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. For product candidates that have been designated as breakthrough therapies, interaction and communication between the FDA and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens. Product candidates designated as breakthrough therapies by the FDA are also eligible for priority review if supported by clinical data at the time of the submission of the NDA.

Designation as a breakthrough therapy is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if we believe that one of our product candidates meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. In any event, the receipt of a breakthrough therapy designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review or approval compared

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

## Table of Contents

to product candidates considered for approval under conventional FDA procedures and it would not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more of our product candidates qualify as breakthrough therapies, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or it may decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.

## We must comply with applicable post-marketing regulatory obligations, which could include obtaining new regulatory approvals or clearances.

Following approval or clearance, some types of changes to the approved or cleared product, such as adding new indications or additional labeling claims or introducing manufacturing changes, are subject to FDA review and approval, which may require further nonclinical or clinical testing. The costs and other resource burdens associated with obtaining new regulatory approvals or clearances for existing or future products may limit the resources available to us to fully exploit our technologies or may otherwise limit our ability to carry out other business activities. Depending on the nature of the change, we may determine that the change may be carried out without obtaining premarket approval or clearance. The FDA or another regulatory body could disagree with our conclusion and require such premarket approval or clearance, which would disrupt the marketing of these products, potentially expose us to regulatory sanctions, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

## The FDA may determine that certain of our products that are, or are derived from, human cells or tissues do not qualify for regulation solely under Section 361 of the PHSA, and may require that the products be removed from the market until we obtain premarket clearance or approval.

Certain of the products that we manufacture, process and distribute are, or are derived from, human cells or tissues, including amniotic tissue. The FDA has specific regulations governing human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products, or HCT/Ps. In particular, HCT/Ps that meet certain criteria set forth in the FDA's regulations at 21 C.F.R. § 1271.10 are regulated solely under Section 361 of the PHSA, so-called "Section 361 HCT/Ps", and are not subject to any premarket clearance or approval requirements. They are also subject to less stringent post-market regulatory requirements than products regulated under Section 351 of the PHSA and/or under Sections 505, 510 or 515 of the FDCA. The Company has believed that certain of our HCT/Ps, including our products derived from amniotic membrane, qualify for regulation as Section 361 HCT/Ps. However, the regulatory classification of an HCT/P as a Section 361 HCT/P depends in part on the purposes for which the product is intended and in part on the processing to which an HCT/P is subject. On November 16, 2017, the FDA issued a final guidance document entitled, "Regulatory Considerations for Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products: Minimal Manipulation and Homologous Use", or 361 HCT/P Guidance, which provides FDA's current thinking on how to apply the existing regulatory criteria for regulation as a Section 361 HCT/P. These include, in addition to other requirements, requirements that an HCT/P be both minimally manipulated and intended for homologous use. In general, "minimal manipulation" is a standard referring to the degree to which the original characteristics of an HCT/P have been altered by processing and "homologous use" refers to the requirement that an HCT/P perform the same basic function in the donor as in the recipient. Any action by the FDA to apply the principles set forth in the 361 HCT/P Guidance to the HCT/Ps that we distribute could have adverse consequences for us and make it more difficult or expensive for us to conduct our business.

In light of the 361 HCT/P Guidance, our labeling and marketing claims for our placental-based membrane products, including our Affinity, NuShield and Novachor products, clarify that they are intended as wound coverings, and thus meet the homologous use requirement to qualify as Section 361 HCT/Ps. However, the FDA could disagree with our conclusion and require premarket approval or clearance for Affinity, NuShield, or any placental-based sheet product we market, which would disrupt the marketing of these products, potentially expose us to regulatory sanctions, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we believe it is necessary to obtain FDA approval of a BLA for NuCel and ReNu because those products may be deemed to be more than minimally manipulated, not for homologous use, or otherwise not regulated as Section 361 HCT/Ps. We continue to conduct clinical studies of ReNu to support FDA

## Table of Contents

approval of a Biologics License Application for the management of symptoms associated with knee osteoarthritis and, based on favorable feasibility studies that are subject to further evaluation, we believe ReNu has potential as a treatment for additional osteoarthritis and tissue regeneration applications. We have discontinued clinical development of NuCel. If we obtain BLA approval for ReNu or NuCel, compliance with applicable post-market regulatory requirements will involve significant time and substantial costs. Even for those products that remain regulated as Section 361 HCT/Ps, increasing regulatory scrutiny within the industry in which we operate could lead to heightened requirements, compliance with which could be costly. The costs and other resource burdens associated with any of these regulatory outcomes may limit the resources available to us to fully exploit our technologies or may otherwise limit our ability to carry out other business activities.

The 361 HCT/P Guidance originally indicated that the FDA was providing a 36-month enforcement grace period to allow time for distributors of HCT/Ps to make any regulatory submissions and obtain any premarket approvals necessary to comply with the guidance. In July 2020, the FDA announced that the enforcement grace period would be extended until May 31, 2021 as a result of the challenges presented by the COVID-19 public health emergency. On April 21, 2021, the FDA reaffirmed that the enforcement grace period would end on May 31, 2021, at which time we ceased commercial distribution of ReNu and NuCel. Although we believe our suspension of ReNu and NuCel commercialization was timely and proper, the FDA and other regulators may disagree with how or when such commercialization practices were conducted, which could expose us to regulatory sanctions, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

To the extent that the FDA may determine that certain of our products that are, or are derived from, human cells or tissues do not qualify for regulation solely under Section 361 of the PHSA, the introduction of new tissue products would become more expensive, expansion of our tissue product offerings could be significantly delayed, and we could be subject to additional post-market regulatory requirements or suspension of product sales until FDA approval is obtained.

As stated above, in light of the 361 HCT/P Guidance, the FDA may determine that the types of cell- and tissue-based products that we distribute-and in particular, products derived from allografts consisting of human skin or amniotic tissue-are subject to premarket clearance or approval requirements. Should the FDA make such a determination, products of this type, including future products that we seek to introduce, will be much more costly to commercialize, as we will likely have to carry out preclinical work in animals and/or clinical trials in humans to support approval. Such preclinical work and clinical trials are expensive and time-consuming with no guarantee of success. In addition, these products will be subject to more stringent post-market regulatory requirements than those that currently apply, including but not limited to more stringent restrictions on advertising and promotion of these products, as well as more extensive adverse event reporting. In the future, we may also wish to market our existing HCT/P products for new intended uses that may render them ineligible for regulation as Section 361 HCT/Ps and cause them to require premarket clearance or approval and comply with postmarket regulations under the medical device or biological product provisions of the FDCA and/or PHSA instead. Compliance with these requirements will involve significant time and substantial costs and could limit the resources available to us to fully exploit our technologies, including limiting our ability to introduce new allograft-derived products.

We conduct a range of nonclinical, as well as clinical trials, comparative effectiveness, economic and other studies of our products. Unfavorable results from these trials or studies or from similar trials or studies conducted by others may negatively affect the use or adoption of our products by physicians, hospitals and payers, which could have a negative impact on the market acceptance of these products and their profitability.

We conduct a variety of nonclinical and clinical trials, comparative effectiveness studies and economic and other studies of our products, including our ongoing clinical trial for ReNu, in an effort to generate comprehensive clinical and real-world outcomes data and cost effectiveness data in order to obtain product approval and drive further penetration in the markets we serve. In the event that these trials and studies, or similar trials and studies

## Table of Contents

conducted by others, yield unfavorable results, those results could negatively affect the use or adoption of our products by physicians, hospitals and payers, thereby compromising market acceptance and profitability.

Our business is subject to continuing significant regulatory obligations by the FDA and other authorities, compliance with which is expensive and timeconsuming and may impede our ability to fully exploit our technologies or otherwise limit our ability to meet other business objectives.

Aside from the obligation to obtain regulatory approvals or clearances, companies such as ours have ongoing regulatory obligations that are expensive and time-consuming to meet. In particular, the production and marketing of our products are subject to extensive regulation and review by the FDA and numerous other governmental authorities both in the United States and abroad. As noted above, some of the products that we distribute are considered Section 361 HCT/Ps. The FDA's regulation of HCT/Ps includes requirements for registration and listing of products; donor screening and testing; processing and distribution, known as "Current Good Tissue Practices," or cGTP; labeling; record keeping and adverse-reaction reporting; and inspection and enforcement. Moreover, it is likely that the FDA's regulation of HCT/Ps will continue to evolve in the future. Complying with any such new regulatory requirements may entail significant time delays and expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our other products are regulated as biologics and medical devices, which are subject to even more stringent regulation by the FDA. As noted above, these products are subject to rigorous premarket review processes, and an approval or clearance may place substantial restrictions on the indications for which the product may be marketed or the population for whom it may be marketed, may require warnings to accompany the product or may impose other restrictions on the sale and/or use of the product. In addition, approved and cleared products are subject to continuing obligations to comply with other substantial regulatory requirements, including the FDA's cGTP regulations, the FDA's QSR and/or the FDA's Current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP regulations, adverse event reporting, and FDA inspections. The costs and other resource burdens associated with maintaining regulatory approvals or clearances for our products and otherwise meeting our regulatory obligations may limit the resources available to us to fully exploit our technologies or may otherwise limit our ability to carry out other business activities.

In some states, the manufacture, storage, or distribution of HCT/Ps requires a license or permit to operate as a tissue bank or tissue distributor. We believe that we have all required state licenses or permits applicable to the distribution of HCT/Ps, but there is a risk that there may be state or local license or permit requirements of which we are unaware or with which we have not complied. In the event that such noncompliance exists in a given jurisdiction, we could be precluded from distributing HCT/Ps in that jurisdiction and also could be subject to fines or other penalties. If any such actions were to be instituted against us, it could adversely affect our business and/or financial condition.

The American Association of Tissue Banks, or AATB, has issued operating standards for tissue banking. Compliance with these standards is a requirement in order to become an accredited tissue bank. In addition, some states have their own tissue banking regulations. In addition, procurement of certain human organs and tissue for transplantation is subject to the restrictions of the National Organ Transplant Act, or NOTA, which prohibits the transfer of certain human organs, including skin and related tissue for valuable consideration, but permits the reasonable payment associated with the removal, transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control and storage of human tissue and skin. We reimburse tissue banks, hospitals and physicians for their services associated with the recovery, storage and transportation of donated human tissue. Although we have independent third-party appraisals that confirm the reasonableness of the service fees we pay, if we were to be found to have violated NOTA's prohibition on the sale or transfer of human tissue for valuable consideration, we, our officers, or employees, would potentially be subject to criminal enforcement sanctions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

## Table of Contents

## Many of the products we manufacture and process are derived from human tissue and therefore have the potential for disease transmission.

The utilization of human tissue creates the potential for transmission of communicable diseases, including, but not limited to, human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, viral hepatitis, syphilis and other viral, fungal or bacterial pathogens. We are required to comply with federal and state regulations intended to prevent communicable disease transmission.

Although we maintain strict quality controls over the procurement and processing of our tissue, there is no assurance that these quality controls will be adequate. In addition, negative publicity concerning disease transmission from other companies' improperly processed donated tissue could have a negative impact on the demand for our products. If any of our products are implicated in the transmission of any communicable disease, our officers, employees and we could be subject to government sanctions including but not limited to recalls, and civil and criminal liability, with sanctions that include exclusion from doing business with the federal government. We could also be exposed to product liability claims from those who used or received our products as well as loss of our reputation.

Defects, failures or quality issues associated with our products could lead to product recalls or safety alerts, adverse regulatory actions, litigation, including product liability claims, and negative publicity that could erode our competitive advantage and market share and materially adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.

Quality is extremely important to us and our customers due to the serious and costly consequences of product failure. Quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products, and our future operating results will depend on our ability to maintain an effective quality control system and effectively train and manage our workforce with respect to our quality system. The development, manufacture and control of our products are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA and similar foreign agencies. Compliance with these regulatory requirements, including but not limited to the FDA's QSR, GMPs and adverse events/recall reporting requirements in the United States and other applicable regulations worldwide, is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA and foreign regulatory authorities may also require post-market testing and surveillance to monitor the performance of approved products. Our manufacturing facilities and those of our suppliers and independent sales agencies are also subject to periodic regulatory inspections. If the FDA or a foreign authority were to conclude that we have failed to comply with any of these requirements, it could institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions, such as product recalls or seizures, withdrawals, monetary penalties, consent decrees, injunctive actions to halt the manufacture or distribution of products, import detentions of products made outside the United States, export restrictions, restrictions on operations or other civil or criminal sanctions. Civil or criminal sanctions could be assessed against our officers, employees, or us. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively manufacturing, marketing and selling our products.

In addition, we cannot predict the results of future legislative activity or future court decisions, any of which could increase regulatory requirements, subject us to government investigations or expose us to unexpected litigation. Any regulatory action or litigation, regardless of the merits, may result in substantial costs, divert management's attention from other business concerns and place additional restrictions on our sales or the use of our products. In addition, negative publicity, including regarding a quality or safety issue, could damage our reputation, reduce market acceptance of our products, cause us to lose customers and decrease demand for our products. Any actual or perceived quality issues may also result in issuances of physician's advisories against our products or cause us to conduct voluntary recalls. Any product defects or problems, regulatory action, litigation, negative publicity or recalls could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

## Table of Contents

## We may implement a product recall or voluntary market withdrawal, which could significantly increase our costs, damage our reputation and disrupt our business.

The manufacturing, marketing and processing of our products involve an inherent risk that our products or processes may not meet manufacturing specifications, applicable regulatory requirements or quality standards. In that event, we may voluntarily implement a recall or market withdrawal or may be required to do so by a regulatory authority. A recall or market withdrawal of one of our products would be costly and would divert management resources. A recall or withdrawal of one of our products, or a similar product processed by another entity, also could impair sales of our products as a result of confusion concerning the scope of the recall or withdrawal, or as a result of the damage to our reputation for quality and safety.

## We are subject to various governmental regulations relating to the labeling, marketing and sale of our products.

Both before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under regulations promulgated by the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission, and similar U.S. and foreign regulations governing product labeling and advertising, distribution, sale and marketing of our products.

Manufacturers of medical devices and biological products are permitted to promote products solely for the uses and indications set forth in the approved or cleared product labeling. A number of enforcement actions have been taken against manufacturers that promote products for "off-label" uses (i.e., uses that are not described in the approved or cleared labeling), including actions alleging that claims submitted to government healthcare programs for reimbursement of products that were promoted for "off-label" uses are fraudulent in violation of the Federal False Claims Act or other federal and state statutes and that the submission of those claims was caused by off-label promotion. The failure to comply with prohibitions on"off-label" promotion can result in significant monetary penalties, revocation or suspension of a company's business license, suspension of sales of certain products, product recalls, civil or criminal sanctions, exclusion from participating in federal healthcare programs, or other enforcement actions. In the United States, allegations of such wrongful conduct could also result in a corporate integrity agreement with the U.S. government that imposes significant administrative obligations and costs.

## We and our employees and contractors are subject, directly or indirectly, to federal, state and foreign healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including false claims laws. If we are unable to comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.

Our operations are subject to various federal, state and foreign fraud and abuse laws. These laws may constrain our operations, including the financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products.

U.S. federal and state laws that affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:

- · the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind in return for, the purchase, recommendation, leasing or furnishing of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
- · federal physician self-referral law, which prohibits a physician from referring a patient to an entity with which the physician (or an immediate family member) has a financial relationship, for the furnishing of certain designated health services for which payment may be made by Medicare or Medicaid, unless an exception applies;
- · federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment or approval from Medicare, Medicaid, or other government payers that are false or fraudulent;

## Table of Contents

- · Section 242 of HIPAA codified at 18 U.S.C. § 1347, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit a person from knowingly and willfully executing a scheme or from making false or fraudulent statements to defraud any healthcare benefit program (i.e., public or private);
- · federal transparency laws, including the Physician Payments Sunshine Act which requires the tracking and disclosure to the federal government by pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers of payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals as well as ownership and investment interests that are held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
- · state law equivalents of each of these federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical and medical device companies to comply with their industry's voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict certain payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug and medical device manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws that prohibit giving gifts to licensed healthcare professionals; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts in certain circumstances, such as specific disease states.

In particular, activities and arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, waste and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of activities or other arrangements related to the development, marketing or promotion of products, including pricing and discounting of products, provision of customer incentives, provision of reimbursement support, other customer support services, provision of sales commissions or other incentives to employees and independent contractors and other interactions with healthcare practitioners, other healthcare providers and patients.

Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrow scope of the statutory or regulatory exceptions and safe harbors available, our business activities could be challenged under one or more of these laws. Relationships between medical product manufacturers and health care providers are an area of heightened scrutiny by the government. We engage in various types of activities, including the conduct of speaker programs to educate physicians, the provision of reimbursement advice and support to customers, and the provision of customer and patient support services, that have been the subject of government scrutiny and enforcement action within the medical device industry.

Government expectations and industry best practices for compliance continue to evolve and past activities may not always be consistent with current industry best practices. Further, there is a lack of government guidance as to whether various industry practices comply with these laws, and government interpretations of these laws continue to evolve, all of which create compliance uncertainties. Any non-compliance could result in regulatory sanctions, criminal or civil liability and serious harm to our reputation. Although we have a comprehensive compliance program designed to ensure that our employees' and commercial partners' activities and interactions with healthcare professionals and patients are appropriate, ethical, and consistent with all applicable laws, regulations, guidelines, policies and standards, it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in preventing such conduct, mitigating risks, or reducing the chance of governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations.

If a government entity opens an investigation into possible violations of any of these laws (which may include the issuance of subpoenas or civil investigative demands), we would have to expend significant resources to defend ourselves against the allegations. Allegations that we, our officers, or our employees violated any one of these laws can be made by individuals called "whistleblowers" who may be our employees, customers,

## Table of Contents

competitors or other parties. Government policy is to encourage individuals to become whistleblowers and file a complaint in federal court alleging wrongful conduct. The government is required to investigate all of these complaints and decide whether to intervene. If the government intervenes and we are required to pay money back to the government, the whistleblower, as a reward, is awarded a percentage of the collection. If the government declines to intervene, the whistleblower may proceed on their own and, if they are successful, they will receive a percentage of any judgment or settlement amount the company is required to pay. The government may also initiate an investigation on its own. Such actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines, and other sanctions that may materially impair our ability to run a profitable business. In particular, if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or if we agree to settle with the government without admitting to any wrongful conduct or if we are found to be in violation of any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we, our officers and employees may be subject to sanctions, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from participation in government health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, imprisonment, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations and the imposition of a corporate integrity agreement, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

## We could be subject to legal exposure if we do not report the average sales prices, or ASP, to government agencies or if our reporting is not accurate and complete.

Our products are reimbursed by Medicare in physician office settings at a rate of ASP plus 6%. Congress has currently suspended the sequestration and there will be no sequestration through March 31, 2022. On April 1, 2022 there will be a 1% sequestration and beginning on July 1, 2022, the sequestration will return to 2%. Sequestration applies to the government's payment portion, which is 80% of the total payment amount. Previously, we were not required to report ASP for our products because they are regulated as medical devices by the FDA, although we have chosen to report ASP for some of our products. Starting with the reporting deadline for the first quarter of 2022, we will be required to report ASP for all our products as a result of provisions included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020. Government price reporting requirements are complex. If we do not report ASP correctly, we could be subject to civil monetary penalties and/or, if the violation is knowing or reckless, be subject to false claims act liability. In the case of very serious or repeated violations, we could be excluded from doing business with the Medicare program and other federal healthcare programs.

## We face significant uncertainty in the industry due to government healthcare reform and other legislative action.

There have been and continue to be laws enacted by the federal government, state governments, regulators and third-party payers to control healthcare costs, and generally, to reform the healthcare system in the United States. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 ("PPACA") and the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 substantially changed the way healthcare is delivered and financed by both governmental and private insurers. These changes included the creation of demonstration programs and other value-based purchasing initiatives that provide financial incentives for physicians and hospitals to reduce costs, including incentives for furnishing low cost therapies for chronic wounds even if those therapies are less effective than our products. There are ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or part of PPACA. Tax reform legislation was passed that includes provisions that impact healthcare insurance coverage and payment such as the elimination of the tax penalty for individuals who do not maintain health insurance coverage (the so-called "individual mandate"). Such actions or similar actions could have a negative effect on the utilization of our products. We expect such efforts to continue and that there may be additional reform proposals at federal and state levels. On December 18, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld a lower court's determination in California v. Texas (orig. Texas v. Azar , 4:18-cv-00167), that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case to the lower court for further analysis as to whether PPACA as a whole is unconstitutional because the individual mandate is not severable from other provisions of the law. The United States Supreme Court agreed to review the case and on June 17, 2021 ordered that the Fifth Circuit's decision be reversed and that the case be dismissed.

General legislative action may also affect our business. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 included provisions to reduce the federal deficit. The Budget Control Act, as amended, resulted in the imposition of reductions of up to 2% in Medicare payments to providers which began in April 2013 and are scheduled to remain in effect through 2025. However, the sequestration has been suspended by Congressional action. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act suspended the payment adjustment from May 1 through December 31, 2020. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, signed into law on December 27, 2020, further extended the suspension period through March 31, 2021. Congressional action will be required to suspend the sequestration after March 31, 2021. These or other similar reductions in government healthcare spending could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.

Bills currently before the United States Congress may also affect our business, if enacted. For example, the Build Back Better Act, H.R. 5376, 117th Cong. (2021) is pending in the U.S. Senate and contains provisions to limit the price of drugs and biological products. If passed, the Build Back Better Act may impact the pricing of our products. Further, the Cures 2.0 Act, H.R. 6000, 117th Cong. (2021) was introduced into the United States House of Representatives on November 17, 2021 and contains provisions that could result in legal and regulatory changes that affect our business. These changes may include a new payment pathway for breakthrough medical devices that are FDA approved or cleared on or after March 15, 2021. The enactment of Cures 2.0 may also accelerate FDA timelines for designation of breakthrough and RMAT therapies and also result in new requirements for the use of patient experience data and real-world evidence in regulating certain FDA products. If enacted, these changes could make it easier for our competitors to bring comparable or more advanced products to market quickly, resulting in reduced demand for our products.

## Our sales into foreign markets expose us to risks associated with international sales and operations.

We are currently selling into foreign markets and plan to expand such sales. Managing a global organization is difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. Conducting international operations subjects us to risks that could be different than those faced by us in the United States. The sale and shipment of our products across international borders, as well as the purchase of components and products from international sources, subject us to extensive U.S. and foreign governmental trade, import and export and customs regulations and laws, including but not limited to, the Export Administration Regulations and trade sanctions against embargoed countries, which are administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control within the Department of the Treasury, as well as the laws and regulations administered by the Department of Commerce. These regulations limit our ability to market, sell, distribute or otherwise transfer our products or technology to prohibited countries or persons.

Compliance with these regulations and laws is costly, and failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could adversely affect us in a variety of ways that include, but are not limited to, significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including imprisonment of individuals, fines and penalties, denial of export privileges, seizure of shipments and restrictions on certain business activities. Also, the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our distribution and sales activities.

These risks may limit or disrupt our expansion, restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contractual rights or the taking of property by nationalization or expropriation without fair compensation. Operating in international markets also requires significant management attention and financial resources.

## We could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, including the requirements to maintain accurate information and internal controls. We operate in many parts of

## Table of Contents

the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. There is no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA or other violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, including contract cancellations or debarment, and loss of reputation, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

## Risks Related to Reimbursement for our Products

## The rate of reimbursement and coverage for the purchase of our products by government and private insurance is subject to change.

Sales of almost all of our products depend partly on the ability of our customers to obtain reimbursement for the cost of our products under government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and from other global government authorities. Government healthcare programs and private health plans continuously seek to reduce healthcare costs. For example, in 2014, Medicare established a policy to stop making separate payment for our products in certain clinical settings. This policy required us to reduce prices for our products which caused significant reduction in our revenue. As of January 1, 2018, our PuraPly AM and PuraPly products no longer qualified for separate payments under Medicare and this change resulted in a reduction in our revenue as compared to prior periods.

In March 2018, the United States Congress passed, and the President signed into law, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, or the Appropriations Act. The Appropriations Act restored the pass-through status effective October 1, 2018 for drugs or biologicals whose period of pass-through payment status ended on December 31, 2018 and for which payment was packaged into a covered hospital outpatient service furnished beginning on January 1, 2018; PuraPly and PuraPly AM met these conditions. As a result, PuraPly and PuraPly AM were included in the "bundled" payment structure from January 1, 2018 through September 30, 2018 after which time Medicare resumed making pass-through payments to hospitals when they use PuraPly and PuraPly AM in the outpatient hospital setting and in ASCs. PuraPly and PuraPly AM retained this "pass-through" reimbursement status through September 30, 2020. After September 30, 2020, PuraPly and PuraPly AM are bundled as are all of our other products. Our success will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for the costs of such products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other third-party payers and we do not know whether such reimbursement will be available. For example, currently most private payers provide limited coverage for our PuraPly AM, PuraPly, Novachor and NuShield products and as a result, there is limited use of these products for patients covered by private payers.

The continuing efforts of government agencies, private health plans and other payers of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare may adversely affect:

- · the availability of our products due to restricted coverage;
- · the ability of our customers to pay for our products;
- · our ability to maintain pricing so as to generate revenues or achieve or maintain profitability; and
- · our ability to access capital.

Payers are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both the breadth of coverage and the level of reimbursement, particularly for new therapeutic products generally or specifically for new therapeutic products that target an indication that is perceived to be well served by existing treatments. Specifically, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, enacted in 2010 contains provisions for Medicare demonstration programs that create financial incentives to treat patients with chronic wounds

## Table of Contents

conservatively and not use our products. Furthermore, all our products are not paid separately in the outpatient hospital setting which is our largest customer base. This payment policy has created incentives to use our competitors' products. Accordingly, even if coverage and reimbursement are provided, market acceptance of our products has been and will be adversely affected if access to coverage is administratively burdensome to obtain and/or use of our products is administratively burdensome or unprofitable for healthcare providers or less profitable than alternative treatments. In addition, reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payers is usually adjusted yearly as a result of legislative, regulatory and policy changes as well as budgetary pressures. In fact, Medicare has signaled that it may discontinue its two-tier bundling policy when it solicited comments on alternatives in its calendar year 2019 rulemaking. Changes in the policy could occur as early as calendar year 2023 and could include the establishment of a single bundle for all products which could place our products at a significant competitive disadvantage. Possible reductions in, or eliminations of, coverage or reimbursement by thirdparty payers, or the denial of, or provision of uneconomical reimbursement for new products, as a result of these changes may affect our customers' revenue and ability to purchase our products. Any changes in the healthcare regulatory, payment or enforcement landscape relative to our customers' healthcare services also have the potential to significantly affect our operations and revenue. In addition, Medicare uses regional contractors called Medicare Administrative Contractors, or MACs, to process claims, develop coverage policies and make payments within designated geographic jurisdictions. While our products are currently covered by most MACs, we cannot be certain they will be in the future.

Wound care supplies, such as our product line acquired from CPN Biosciences, are subject to coding verification from CMS's Pricing, Data Analysis and Coding contractor (the "PDAC"). The PDAC is responsible for verifying the HCPCS Level II DMEPOS Codes for all wound care supplies. Our current wound care supplies sold through CPN have received coding verification from the PDAC and all products have HCPCS Level II codes. Additional wound care supplies that we develop or acquire will also be subject the PDAC coding verification process. We cannot guarantee the outcome of the PDAC coding verification process. If we are unsuccessful in receiving verification of the applicable HCPCS codes for our products, our wound care supplies could be ineligible for reimbursement or reimbursed at a lower rate than appropriate for our supplies.

While we cannot predict the outcome of current or future legislation, we anticipate, particularly given the recent focus on healthcare reform legislation, that governmental authorities will continue to introduce initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of healthcare and restricting coverage and reimbursement for our products. If we are not successful in obtaining adequate reimbursement for our products from third-party payers, the market's acceptance of our products could be adversely affected. Inadequate reimbursement levels also likely would create downward price pressure on our products. Even if we do succeed in obtaining widespread reimbursement for our products, future changes in reimbursement policies could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

## The rate of reimbursement and coverage for the purchase of our products by government and private insurance (including by Medicare Administrative Contractors) is subject to uncertainty.

Our products are subject to varying forms of governmental and private payor reimbursement, and fluctuations in these forms of payment may adversely affect our business. For example, in sites of service where payment for skin substitutes is based on the Average Sales Price ("ASP") methodology, Medicare pays for skin substitutes separately from the application procedure. In this case, the Medicare payment rate for all skin substitutes (including ours) is calculated based on the manufacturer's reported ASP on a per square centimeter basis. These rates are adjusted quarterly based on manufacturer ASP reporting, and the payment amount is ASP plus 6%. The Medicare sequestration of 2% has been temporarily suspended and that suspension will continue through March 31, 2022. On April 1, 2022, the sequestration will be 1% and it will return to 2% as of July 1, 2022. Previously, the Medicare statute did not require us to report ASP for our products because they are regulated by the FDA as medical devices. However, starting with the reporting deadline for the first quarter of 2022, we will be required to report ASP for our products based on a provision within the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020, signed into law on December 27, 2020.

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

## Table of Contents

When ASP data are not available in the quarterly ASP file published by CMS (for instance our Affinity product in the fourth quarter of 2021), the Part A/B MACs establish payment for drugs and biologics in their jurisdiction(s). In these situations, MACs can update their reimbursement methodology as frequently as quarterly, without notice. MACs also have the discretion to establish coverage policies for all skin substitute products (including ours). Accordingly, even if coverage and reimbursement are provided, market acceptance of our products has been and will be adversely affected if access to coverage is administratively burdensome to obtain, use of our products is administratively burdensome, or is unprofitable for healthcare providers or less profitable than alternative treatments.

Furthermore, Medicare has signaled that it may revise itstwo-tiered bundled payment policy for skin substitutes. Medicare solicited comments in rulemaking for calendar year 2019 related to proposed updates and policy changes under the Medicare Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) and Ambulatory Surgical Center (ASC) Payment System. Medicare specifically solicited comments on whether it should eliminate the two-tiered bundle policy and establish a single bundle for all products. Based on the statements made in the proposed rule, it is possible that Medicare will revise its payment policy for calendar year 2023. Any revised policy could result in decreased reimbursement for our products which could decrease utilization and reduce our revenues. Moreover, any new policy could result in a financial incentive for hospitals and ASCs to use our competitor's products, thereby reducing our market share and revenue.

## Cost-containment efforts of our customers, purchasing groups, third-party payers and governmental organizations could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Many existing and potential customers for our products within the United States are members of GPOs and/or IDNs, including accountable care organizations or public-based purchasing organizations, and our business is partly dependent on major contracts with these organizations. Our products can be contracted under national tenders or with larger hospital GPOs. GPOs and IDNs negotiate pricing arrangements with healthcare product manufacturers and distributors and offer the negotiated prices to affiliated hospitals and other members. GPOs and IDNs typically award contracts on a category-by-category basis through a competitive bidding process. At any given time, we are typically at various stages of responding to bids and negotiating and renewing GPO and IDN agreements, including agreements that would otherwise expire. Bids are generally solicited from multiple manufacturers or service providers with the intention of obtaining lower pricing. Due to the highly competitive nature of the bidding process and the GPO and IDN contracting processes in the United States, we may not be able to obtain or maintain contract positions with major GPOs and IDNs across our product portfolio. Failure to be included in certain of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, while having a contract with a major purchaser, such as a GPO or IDN, for a given product category can facilitate sales, sales volumes of those products may not be maintained. For example, GPOs and IDNs are increasingly awarding contracts to multiple suppliers for the same product category. Even when we are the sole contracted supplier of a GPO or IDN for a certain product category, members of the GPO or IDN generally are free to purchase from other suppliers. Furthermore, GPO and IDN contracts typically are terminable without cause upon 60 to 90 days' notice. The healthcare industry has been consolidating, and the consolidation among third-party payers into larger purchasing groups will increase their negotiating and purchasing power. Such consolidation may result in greater pricing pressure on us due to pricing concessions and may further exacerbate the risks described above.

## Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property

## Our patents and other intellectual property rights may not adequately protect our products.

Our ability to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology and manufacturing processes. We rely on manufacturing and other know-how, patents, trade secrets, trademarks, license agreements and contractual provisions to establish our intellectual property rights and protect our products. These legal means, however, afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect

## Table of Contents

our rights. The failure to obtain, maintain, enforce or defend such intellectual property rights, for any reason, could allow third parties to make competing products or impact our ability to develop, manufacture and market our own products on a commercially viable basis, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition or results of operations.

In particular, we rely primarily on trade secrets,know-how and other unpatented technology, which are difficult to protect. Although we seek such protection in part by entering into confidentiality agreements with our vendors, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information, we cannot be certain that these agreements will not be breached, adequate remedies for any breach would be available or our trade secrets, know-how and other unpatented proprietary technology will not otherwise become known to or be independently developed by our competitors. If we are unsuccessful in protecting our intellectual property rights, sales of our products may suffer and our ability to generate revenue could be severely impacted.

We have filed applications to register various trademarks for use in connection with our products in various countries and also, with respect to certain products, rely on the trademarks of third parties. These trademarks may not afford adequate protection. We or these third parties also may not have the financial resources to enforce the rights under these trademarks which may enable others to use the trademarks and dilute their value. Additionally, our marks may be found to conflict with the trademarks of third parties. In such a case, we may not be able to derive any value from such trademarks or, even, may be required to cease using the conflicting mark. The value of our trademarks may also be diminished by our own actions, such as failing to impose appropriate quality control when licensing our trademarks. Any of the foregoing could impair the value of, or ability to use, our trademarks and have an adverse effect on our business.

Most of the key patents related to our marketed products are expired. We have no patent protection covering, for example, our Apligraf, Dermagraft, or NuShield products. However, in addition to trade secrets, trademarks, know-how and other unpatented technology, we have pursued and plan to continue to pursue patent protection where we believe that doing so offers potential commercial benefits. However, we may be incorrect in our assessments of whether or when to pursue patent protection. Moreover, patents may not issue from any of our pending patent applications. Even if we obtain or in-license issued patents, such patent rights may not provide valid patent protection sufficiently broad to prevent any third party from developing, using or commercializing products that are similar or functionally equivalent to our products or technologies, or otherwise provide any competitive advantage. In addition, these patent rights may be challenged, revoked, invalidated, infringed or circumvented by third parties. Laws relating to such rights may in the future be changed or withdrawn in a manner adverse to us.

Additionally, our products or the technologies or processes used to formulate or manufacture our products may now, or in the future, infringe the patent rights of third parties. It is also possible that third parties will obtain patent or other proprietary rights that might be necessary or useful for the development, manufacture or sale of our products. In such cases, we may need or choose to obtain licenses for intellectual property rights from others and it is possible that we may not be able to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.

## Pending and future intellectual property litigation could be costly and disruptive and may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We operate in an industry characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation. Defending intellectual property litigation is expensive and complex, takes significant time and diverts management's attention from other business concerns, and the outcomes are difficult to predict. We have in the past been subject to claims that our products or technology violate a third party's intellectual property rights, and we may be subject to such assertions in the future. Any pending or future intellectual property litigation may result in significant damage awards, including treble damages under certain circumstances, and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or could force us to seek a license and/or make significant royalty or other payments in order to continue selling the affected products. Such licenses may not be available on

## Table of Contents

commercially reasonable terms, if at all. We have in the past and may in the future choose to settle disputes involving third-party intellectual property by taking a license. Such licenses or other settlements may involve, for example, upfront payments, yearly maintenance fees and royalties. At any given time, we may be involved as either a plaintiff or a defendant in a number of intellectual property actions, the outcomes of which may not be known for prolonged periods of time. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement or misappropriation against us could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

## We may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we, our employees, or our independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets, proprietary or confidential information of our competitors or are in breach of non-competition or non-solicitation agreements with our competitors.

Some of our employees were previously employed at other medical device, pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies. We may also hire additional employees who are currently employed at other medical device, pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, including our competitors. Additionally, consultants or other independent agents with which we may contract may be or have been in a contractual arrangement with one or more of our competitors. Although no claims are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that we, our employees, or our independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of these former employers or competitors. In addition, we have been and may in the future be subject to claims that we caused an employee to breach the terms of his or her non-competition or non-solicitation agreement. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management. If we fail to defend such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. There can be no assurance that this type of litigation will not occur, and any future litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our ability to hire additional direct sales representatives, or other personnel. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to market existing or new products, which could severely harm our business.

## We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time-consuming and ultimately unsuccessful.

Competitors may infringe or misappropriate the patents or other intellectual property that we own or license. In response, we may be required to file infringement claims, which can be expensive and time-consuming. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us, such as alleging that we infringe their patents. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent that we own or license is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, construe the patent's claims narrowly or conclude that there is no infringement. An adverse result in any litigation or defense proceeding could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing.

Interference proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by us may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to the patents or patent applications that we own or license. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the invention or attempt to license rights to it from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms. Our defense of litigation or interference proceedings may fail and, even if successful, may result in substantial costs and distract our management and other employees. We may not be able to prevent, alone or with our licensors, misappropriation of our intellectual property rights, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States.

## Table of Contents

## If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets andknow-how, our business and competitive position would be harmed.

We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Despite our efforts, agreements may be breached and security measures may fail, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach or failure. In addition, our trade secrets and know-how may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. Moreover, if any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor, we would have no right to prevent them, or those to whom they communicate it, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our competitive position would be harmed.

## We may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of the patents and other intellectual property that we own or license.

We may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in the patents and intellectual property that we own or license. While it is our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the development of intellectual property to execute agreements obligating them to assign such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who in fact develops intellectual property that we regard as our own; our licensors may face similar obstacles. We could be subject to ownership disputes arising, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against any claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending any such claims, we may have to pay monetary damages and may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, intellectual property, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.

## Obtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.

Periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees and other fees on patents and patent applications will be due to be paid to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and similar foreign agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patents and patent applications. We rely on our outside counsel to pay these fees due to foreign patent agencies. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and various foreign patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other provisions during the patent application process. We employ law firms and other professionals to help us comply, and in many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, there are situations in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, potential competitors might be able to enter the market, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

## Table of Contents

## C hanges in U.S. patent law could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.

Success in the biopharmaceutical industry is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the pharmaceutical industry involve both technological and legal complexity, and therefore obtaining and enforcing pharmaceutical patents is costly, timeconsuming and inherently uncertain.

Recent patent reform legislation could increase the uncertainties and costs of prosecuting patent applications and enforcing and defending patents. Enacted in 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, made significant changes to U.S. patent law, including provisions that affect the prosecution of patent applications and also affect patent litigation. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office developed new regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many of the substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act, including the first to file provisions, only became effective in March 2013. The full impact of the Leahy-Smith Act on our business is not yet clear, but it could result in increased costs and more limited patent protection, either of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Moreover, recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty regarding our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty regarding the value of any patents we do obtain. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce any current or future patents that we may own or license.

## Risks Related to Our Indebtedness

## Our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $74.1 million of aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under our 2021 Credit Agreement. Our indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness and could have other important consequences to our debt holders and significant effects on our business. For example, it could:

- · increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;
- · require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to making payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;
- · limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;
- · expose us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings are at variable rates, and we may not be able to enter into interest rate swaps and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk;
- · restrict us from capitalizing on business opportunities;
- · make it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations, including payments on our indebtedness;
- · place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other general corporate purposes.

## Table of Contents

In addition, the credit agreements governing our senior secured credit facilities collateralize substantially all of our personal property and assets, including our intellectual property, and contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness.

## Despite our current level of indebtedness, we may incur substantially more debt. This could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial leverage.

We may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although the credit agreements governing our senior secured and subordinated credit facilities limit our ability and the ability of our present and future subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, the terms of the senior secured and subordinated credit facilities permit us to incur significant additional indebtedness under certain circumstances. In addition, the credit agreements governing our senior secured and subordinated credit facilities do not prohibit us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness as defined therein. To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness or such other obligations, the risk associated with our substantial indebtedness described above, including our potential inability to service our debt, will increase.

## We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt, and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and any failure to meet our debt service obligations could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund working capital needs and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.

If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or if future borrowings are not available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before the maturity thereof, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may not be able to effect any of these actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our ability to restructure or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments, including the credit agreements governing our senior and subordinated secured credit facilities, may limit or prevent us from taking any of these actions. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would have an adverse effect, which could be material, on our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as on our ability to satisfy our obligations in respect of the senior and subordinated secured credit facilities and our other indebtedness.

## Our failure to comply with the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, including as a result of events beyond our control, could result in an event of default that could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

If there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness, the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately. We cannot guarantee that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings

## Table of Contents

under our outstanding debt instruments if accelerated upon an event of default. Further, if we are unable to repay, refinance or restructure our indebtedness under our secured debt, the holders of such debt could proceed against the collateral securing that indebtedness. In addition, any event of default or declaration of acceleration under one debt instrument could also result in an event of default under one or more of our other debt instruments. As a result, any default by us on our indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

## The credit agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and our subordinated credit facility restrict our current and future operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions.

The credit agreements governing our senior secured credit facility and our subordinated credit facility are collateralized by substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property, and impose significant operating and financial restrictions and limit our ability and our other restricted subsidiaries' ability to, among other things:

- · incur additional indebtedness for borrowed money and guarantee indebtedness;
- · pay dividends or make other distributions in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, capital stock;
- · enter into any new line of business not reasonably related to our existing business;
- · prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;
- · make loans and investments;
- · sell or otherwise dispose of assets;
- · incur liens;
- · enter into transactions with affiliates; and
- · enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends; and consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.

As a result of these covenants and restrictions, we are and will be limited in how we conduct our business, and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. In addition, our senior secured credit facility requires us to comply with a minimum consolidated revenue covenant (measured on a trailing twelve-month basis) and a minimum monthly liquidity ratio (measured as of the last day of each month). The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in the senior secured credit facility, as well as any future financing agreements that we may enter into, may restrict our ability to finance our operations, engage in business activities or expand or fully pursue our business strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to meet those covenants. For example, in the past, we have not been in compliance with certain financial covenants in our debt agreements, which may occur again in the future. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.

Our failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as others contained in our future debt instruments from time to time could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.

## Risks Related to Our Class A Common Stock

There can be no assurance that the Company's Class A common stock will continue to be listed on Nasdaq or that the Company will be able to comply with the continued listing standards of Nasdaq.

Our Class A common stock is listed on Nasdaq under the symbol "ORGO". On December 10, 2018, Avista Healthcare Public Acquisition Corp., our predecessor company ("AHPAC"), consummated a business combination (the "Avista Merger") pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 17, 2018 (as amended, the "Avista Merger Agreement"), by and among AHPAC, Avista Healthcare Merger Sub, Inc., a direct whollyowned subsidiary of AHPAC ("Avista Merger Sub") and Organogenesis Inc. As a result of the Avista Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Avista Merger Agreement, Avista Merger Sub merged with and into Organogenesis Inc., with Organogenesis Inc. surviving the Avista Merger, and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of AHPAC. AHPAC changed its name to "Organogenesis Holdings Inc." (ORGO). Trading of AHPAC's Class A common stock and public warrants was suspended as a result of the redemption on October 31, 2018 of all of AHPAC's public shares. On November 2, 2018, as a result of the redemption of the public shares, Nasdaq issued a delisting notice in respect of the AHPAC units, AHPAC Class A ordinary shares and AHPAC warrants to purchase Class A ordinary shares. On November 9, 2018, AHPAC submitted a request for an oral hearing before the Hearings Panel to appeal the delisting determination pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Nasdaq rules. That hearing occurred on December 13, 2018 and on January 4, 2019, Nasdaq notified us that the Hearings Panel granted our request for the continued listing of our Class A common stock and lifted the trading suspension at the open of the market on January 8, 2019. Pursuant to the Hearing Panel's decision, on or before March 31, 2019, we were required to demonstrate to the satisfaction of Staff and the Hearings Panel that we had a minimum of 300 round lot stockholders and that we otherwise meet all applicable requirements for listing on Nasdaq. The Hearings Panel determined to delist our public warrants due to our non-compliance with the minimum 400 round lot holder requirement for initial listing on Nasdaq, as required by Nasdaq Listing Rule 5515(a)(4). On March 12, 2019, the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC filed a Form 25 with the SEC to delist the public warrants. The delisting became effective on March 22, 2019 (ten days after the Form 25 was filed). In connection with our exchange offer in the summer of 2019, we issued an aggregate of 2,925,731 shares of our Class A commons stock in exchange for all outstanding public warrants, which, until such time, traded "over-the-counter" under the trading symbol "ORGOW." Even though the Company was able to regain compliance with the Nasdaq listing standards with respect to its Class A common stock, the Company can provide no assurance that it can maintain compliance with those standards.

If Nasdaq delists the Company's Class A common stock from trading on its exchange for failure to meet the listing standards, the Company's stockholders could face significant material adverse consequences including:

- · a limited availability of market quotations for the Company's securities;
- · reduced liquidity for the Company's securities;
- · a determination that the Company's Class A common stock is a "penny stock" which will require brokers trading in the Company's Class A common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for the Company's securities;
- · a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and
- · a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.

## On May 6, 2021, we ceased to qualify as a "controlled company" within the meaning of the Nasdaq rules. Although we are no longer a controlled company, during the phase-in period we may continue to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements that provide protection to stockholders of other Nasdaq listed companies.

On May 6, 2021, upon the completion of a distribution by Organo PFG LLC, an affiliate of one of our directors and a significant stockholder, of shares of our Class A common stock to its members, we ceased to be a controlled company within the meaning of the Nasdaq rules. The Nasdaq rules exempt controlled companies from certain governance requirements including (i) the requirement that a majority of the board of directors consist of independent directors, (ii) the requirement to have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities or independent director involvement in the selection of director nominees, by having director nominees selected or recommended by a majority of its independent directors meeting in executive session and (iii) the requirement to have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee's purpose and responsibilities.

Under the Nasdaq rules, a company that ceases to be a controlled company must comply with the independent board committee requirements as they relate to the nominating and corporate governance committee (if applicable) and compensation committee on the following phase-in schedule: (1) one independent committee member at the time it ceases to be a controlled company, (2) a majority of independent committee members within 90 days of the date it ceases to be a controlled company and (3) all independent committee members within one year of the date it ceases to be a controlled company. Additionally, the Nasdaq rules provide a 12-month phase-in period from the date a company ceases to be a controlled company to comply with the majority independent board requirement.

Accordingly, following the loss of controlled company status on May 6, 2021, our board of directors determined to have director nominees recommended by a majority of our independent directors meeting in executive session. On August 3, 2021, the board of directors voted to establish a nominating committee of the board of directors, consisting of independent directors only. In addition, one member of our compensation committee was independent on May 6, 2021, a majority of the members of our compensation committee were independent by August 4, 2021 and all of the members of the compensation committee were independent by February 15, 2022. A majority of the members of our board of directors must be independent by May 6, 2022.

During these phase-in periods, our stockholders will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies of which the majority of directors are independent and, if, within the phase-in periods, we are not able to recruit additional directors who would qualify as independent, or otherwise comply with the Nasdaq listing requirements, we may be subject to enforcement actions by Nasdaq. In addition, a change in our board of directors and committee membership may result in a change in corporate strategy and operating philosophies, and may result in deviations from our current growth strategy.

## The Significant Stockholder Group exercises significant control over us, and their interests may conflict with yours in the future.

Alan A. Ades, Albert Erani, Glenn H. Nussdorf, Dennis Erani, Starr Wisdom and certain of their respective affiliates, including Organo PFG LLC, Organo Investors LLC, Dennis Erani 2012 Issue Trust, Alan Ades as Trustee of the Alan Ades 2014 GRAT, Albert Erani Family Trust dated 12/29/2012, GN 2016 Family Trust u/a/d August 12, 2016 and GN 2016 Organo 10-Year GRAT u/a/d September 30, 2016, who we refer to collectively as the Significant Stockholder Group, control a significant amount of the voting power of the outstanding Class A common stock. As of February 15, 2022, the Significant Stockholder Group collectively beneficially own approximately 46% of the Company's Class A common stock. As a result of this voting control, the Significant Stockholder Group collectively can effectively determine the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval, including, but not limited to, the election and removal of the Company's directors (including the right to designate four of our directors pursuant to the terms of an agreement between the Company and the Significant

## Table of Contents

Stockholder Group), as well as other matters of corporate or management policy (such as potential mergers or acquisitions, payment of dividends, asset sales, and amendments to the Company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws). This concentration of ownership may delay or deter possible changes in control and limit the liquidity of the trading market for the Company's Class A common stock, which may reduce the value of an investment in its Class A common stock. This voting control could also deprive stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their shares of Class A common stock as part of a potential sale of the Company. So long as the Significant Stockholder Group and their affiliates continue to own a significant amount of the Company's combined voting power, they may continue to be able to strongly influence or effectively control its decisions. The interests of the Significant Stockholder Group and their affiliates may not coincide with the interests of other holders of the Company Class A common stock.

In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Significant Stockholder Group and their affiliates may engage in activities where their interests conflict with our interests or those of our other stockholders. In addition, the Significant Stockholder Group may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment, even though such transactions might involve risks to you.

The Company bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, to the fullest extent permitted by law, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by the Company stockholders, which could limit the ability of the Company stockholders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with the Company or with directors, officers or employees of the Company and may discourage stockholders from bringing such claims.

Under the Company bylaws, unless the Company consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum will be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware for:

- · any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of the Company;
- · any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or any wrongdoing by, any director, officer or employee of the Company to the Company or the Company's stockholders;
- · any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, the certificate of incorporation (including as it may be amended from time to time), or the bylaws;
- · any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of the certificate of incorporation or the bylaws; or
- · any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case, except for, (1) any action as to which the Court of Chancery determines that there is an indispensable party not subject to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (and the indispensable party does not consent to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery within ten (10) days following such determination) and (2) any action asserted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, for which federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

These provisions of the Company's certificate of incorporation and bylaws could limit the ability of the Company stockholders to obtain a favorable judicial forum for certain disputes with the Company or with its directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against the Company and its directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of the Company's certificate of incorporation or bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the types of actions or proceedings listed above including, without limitation, any actions asserted under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Company may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce the Company's forum selection provision with respect to any actions asserted under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, as investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

## Table of Contents

## Provisions in the Company's charter may inhibit a takeover of the Company, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for the Company Class A common stock and could entrench management.

The Company's certificate of incorporation contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that shareholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include the ability of the Board of Directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred shares, which may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for the Company's securities.

## General Risk Factors

## We face significant and continuing competition, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We face significant and continuing competition in our business, which is characterized by rapid technological change and significant price competition. Market share can shift as a result of technological innovation and other business factors. Our customers consider many factors when selecting a product, including product reliability, clinical outcomes, economic outcomes, price and services provided by the manufacturer. Our ability to compete depends in large part on our ability to provide compelling clinical and economic benefits to our customers and payers, develop and commercialize new products and technologies and anticipate technological advances. Product introductions or enhancements by competitors which may have advanced technology, better features or lower pricing may make our products obsolete or less competitive. In addition, consolidation in the healthcare industry continues to lead the demand for price concessions or to the exclusion of some suppliers from certain of our markets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. The presence of this competition in our market may lead to pricing pressure, which would make it more difficult to sell our products at a price that will make us profitable or prevent us from selling our products at all. As a result, we will be required to devote continued efforts and financial resources to bring our products under development to market, deliver cost-effective clinical outcomes, expand our geographic reach, enhance our existing products and develop new products for the advanced wound care and soft tissue repair markets. Even if we develop cost effective and/or new products, they may not be covered or reimbursed due to cost-containment and other financial pressures from payers.

## Our future capital needs are uncertain and we may need to raise funds in the future, and such funds may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.

Continued expansion of our business will be expensive and we may seek funds from stock offerings, borrowings under our existing or future credit facilities or other sources. Our capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:

- · the revenues generated by sales of our products;
- · the costs associated with expanding our sales and marketing efforts;
- · the expenses we incur in manufacturing and selling our products;
- · the costs of developing and commercializing new products or technologies;
- · the cost of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval or clearance of certain products and products in development;
- · the number and timing of acquisitions and other strategic transactions such as our acquisition of NuTech Medical, and integration costs associated with such acquisitions;
- · the costs associated with capital expenditures; and
- · unanticipated general, legal and administrative expenses.

## Table of Contents

Our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us and we may need additional funds sooner than planned. Additional funds may not be available when we need them on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Furthermore, if we issue equity or convertible debt securities to raise capital, you may experience dilution, and the new equity or convertible debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges that are senior to or otherwise adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. In addition, if we raise capital through collaboration, licensing or other similar arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our products, potential products or proprietary technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. If we cannot raise capital on acceptable terms, we may not be able to develop our product candidates, enhance our existing products, execute our business plan, take advantage of future opportunities, or respond to competitive pressure, changes in our supplier relationships, or unanticipated customer requirements. Any of these events could adversely affect our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

## Our future success depends on our ability to retain key employees, consultants and advisors and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.

We are highly dependent on our executive officers, the loss of whose services may adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. In particular, we depend on Gary Gillheeney, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Recruiting and retaining other qualified employees, consultants and advisors for our business, including scientific and technical personnel, will also be critical to our success. There is currently a shortage of skilled executives and scientific personnel in our industry, which is likely to continue. As a result, competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous medical device companies for individuals with similar skill sets. The inability to recruit or loss of the services of any executive, key employee, consultant or advisor may impede the progress of our research, development and sales growth objectives.

Our ability to recruit, retain and motivate our employees and consultants will depend in part on our ability to offer attractive compensation. We may also need to increase the level of cash compensation that we pay to them, which may reduce funds available for research and development and support of our sales growth objectives. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash available to offer our employees and consultants attractive compensation.

Despite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management, scientific and development teams may terminate their employment with us. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees and our inability to find suitable replacements could potentially harm our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. We do not maintain "key person" insurance policies on the lives of these individuals or any of our other employees.

Many of the companies that we compete against for qualified personnel have substantially greater financial and other resources and different risk profiles than we do. They may also provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high-quality candidates than what we can offer. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high-quality personnel, the rate and success at which we can discover, develop and commercialize product candidates will be limited.

## Business or economic disruptions or global health concerns could seriously harm our business.

Broad-based business or economic disruptions could adversely affect our business and the sale of our products. For example, in December 2019 an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China, and has since spread to a number of other countries, including the United States. To date, this outbreak has already resulted in extended shutdowns of certain businesses in the Wuhan region and has had ripple effects to businesses around the world. We cannot presently predict the scope and severity of any potential business shutdowns or disruptions, but if we or any of the third parties with whom we engage, including the suppliers,

## Table of Contents

clinical trial sites, regulators, health care providers and other third parties with whom we conduct business, were to experience shutdowns or other business disruptions, our ability to conduct our business could be materially and negatively impacted. It is also possible that global health concerns such as this one could disproportionately impact the hospitals, clinics and healthcare providers to whom we sell our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operation and financial condition.

## Uncertainty and adverse changes in the general economic conditions may negatively affect our business.

If general economic conditions in the United States decline, or if consumers fear that economic conditions will decline, sales of our products may decline. Adverse changes may occur as a result of adverse economic conditions, fluctuating oil prices, supply chain problems, inflation, political instability, declining consumer confidence, a continuation or worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic or another pandemic, unemployment, fluctuations in stock markets, contraction of credit availability, or other factors affecting economic conditions generally. These changes may negatively affect the sales of our existing or development of future products, increase the cost, and decrease the availability of financing, or increase costs associated with producing and distributing our products and potential product candidates.

## Changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters could significantly affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business are highly complex. These matters include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, leases, income taxes, impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets and equity-based compensation. Changes in these rules, guidelines or interpretations could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition.

In addition, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of net revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price.

## Our failure to comply with regulatory obligations could result in negative effects on our business.

The failure by us or one of our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, the FDA or other governmental authorities:

- · imposing fines and penalties on us;
- · preventing us from manufacturing or selling our products;
- · delaying or denying pending applications for approval or clearance of our products or of new uses or modifications to our existing products, or withdrawing or suspending current approvals or clearances;
- · ordering or requesting a recall of our products;
- · issuing warning letters or untitled letters;
- · imposing operating restrictions, including a partial or total shutdown of production or investigation of any or all of our products;

## Table of Contents

- · refusing to permit to import or export of our products;
- · detaining or seizing our products;
- · obtaining injunctions preventing us from manufacturing or distributing any or all of our products;
- · commencing criminal prosecutions or seeking civil penalties; and
- · requiring changes in our advertising and promotion practices.

Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could also result in civil actions against us by private parties (e.g., under the federal Lanham Act and/or state unfair competition laws), and other unanticipated negative consequences. If any of these actions were to occur it could harm our reputation and cause our product sales to suffer and may prevent us from generating revenue.

## Our officers, employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or activities that are improper under other laws and regulations, which would create liability for us.

We are exposed to the risk that our officers, employees, independent contractors (including contract research organizations, or CROs), principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity and/or may fail to disclose unauthorized activities to us. Misconduct by these parties could include, but is not limited to, intentional, reckless and/or negligent failures to comply with:

- · the laws and regulations of the FDA and its foreign counterparts requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such regulatory bodies, including but not limited to safety problems associated with the use of our products;
- · laws and regulations of the FDA and its foreign counterparts concerning the conduct of clinical trials and the protection of human research subjects;
- · other laws and regulations of the FDA and its foreign counterparts relating to the manufacture, processing, packing, holding, investigating or distributing in commerce of medical devices, biological products and/or HCT/Ps; or
- · manufacturing standards we have established.

In particular, companies involved in the manufacture of medical products are subject to laws and regulations intended to ensure that medical products that will be used in patients are safe and effective, and specifically that they are not adulterated or contaminated, that they are properly labeled, and have the identity, strength, quality and purity that which they are represented to possess. Further, companies involved in the research and development of medical products are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to protect research subjects and ensure the integrity of data generated from clinical trials and of the regulatory review process. Any misconduct in any of these areas-whether by our own employees or by contractors, vendors, business associates, consultants, or other entities acting as our agents-could result in regulatory sanctions, criminal or civil liability and serious harm to our reputation. Although we have a comprehensive compliance program designed to ensure that our employees', CRO partners', principal investigators', consultants', and commercial partners' activities and interactions with healthcare professionals and patients are appropriate, ethical, and consistent with all applicable laws, regulations, guidelines, policies and standards, it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in preventing such conduct, mitigating risks, or reducing the chance of governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines, and other sanctions that may materially impair our ability to run a profitable business.

## Table of Contents

## If we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

We are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment, manufacture and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.

Although we maintain workers' compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials or other work-related injuries, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. These current or future laws and regulations may impair our research, development or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines, penalties or other sanctions.

## Unanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of the Company's income or other tax returns could adversely affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations.

The Company is subject to income tax in the United States and Switzerland, and the Company's domestic tax liabilities will be subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. The Company's future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:

- · changes in the valuation of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities;
- · expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;
- · tax effects of stock-based compensation;
- · costs related to intercompany restructurings;
- · changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof; and
- · lower than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where the Company has lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where the Company has higher statutory tax rates.

In addition, the Company may be subject to audits of the Company's income, sales and other taxes by U.S. federal, state, local andnon-U.S. taxing authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.

## A market for the Company's securities may not continue, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of the Company's securities.

The price of the Company's securities may fluctuate significantly due to general market and economic conditions. An active trading market for the Company's securities may never develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. In addition, the price of the Company's securities can vary due to general economic conditions and forecasts, the Company's general business condition and the release of the Company's financial reports. Additionally, if the Company's securities are not listed on, or become delisted from, Nasdaq for any reason, and are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, an inter-dealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not

## Table of Contents

a national securities exchange, the liquidity and price of the Company's securities may be more limited than if the Company was quoted or listed on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established or sustained.

The Company's quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to seasonality and other factors, some of which are beyond the Company's control, resulting in a decline in the Company's stock price.

The Company's quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of several factors, including:

- · labor availability and costs for hourly and management personnel;
- · profitability of the Company's products, especially in new markets and due to seasonal fluctuations;
- · changes in interest or exchange rates;
- · impairment of long-lived assets;
- · macroeconomic conditions, both nationally and locally;
- · negative publicity relating to our products;
- · changes in consumer preferences and competitive conditions; and
- · expansion to new markets.

If securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about the Company, its business, or its market, or if they change their recommendations regarding the Company Class A common stock adversely, then the price and trading volume of the Company Class A common stock could decline.

The trading market for the Company Class A common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, the Company's business, the Company's market, or the Company's competitors. Securities and industry analysts may stop publishing research on the Company. If any analyst who covers the Company were to cease coverage of the Company or fail to regularly publish reports on it, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause the Company's stock price or trading volume to decline. If any of the analysts who cover the Company change their recommendation regarding the Company's stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about the Company's competitors, the price of the Company Class A common stock would likely decline.

## Changes in laws, regulations or rules, or a failure to comply with any laws, regulations or rules, may adversely affect the Company's business, investments and results of operations.

The Company is subject to laws, regulations and rules enacted by national, regional and local governments and Nasdaq. In particular, the Company is required to comply with certain SEC, Nasdaq and other legal or regulatory requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws, regulations and rules is difficult, time-consuming and costly. Those laws, regulations or rules and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or rules, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations.

Our corporate headquarters is located on our four-building campus in Canton, Massachusetts, comprising approximately 300,000 square feet of leased and purchased space devoted to manufacturing, shipping, operations, and research and development. Three of the buildings are leased. The leases were initially set to expire on December 31, 2022 and were subsequently extended to December 31, 2027 when we exercised an option to renew these leases for an additional five-year term in December 2021. We lease the buildings in Canton from entities that are controlled by Alan A. Ades, Albert Erani, Dennis Erani and Glenn H. Nussdorf, who are also our stock holders. In addition, Messrs. Ades, Albert Erani and Nussdorf are former members of our Board of Directors.

In Norwood, Massachusetts, we have a leased facility of approximately 43,850 square feet for office and laboratory use. The lease commenced on March 13, 2019. The rent commencement date was February 1, 2020. The initial lease term is ten years from the rent commencement date and was extended for additional five years in December 2021. We have an option to extend the term for another ten years if exercised within 16-24 months from the end of the lease term.

With the expiration of the La Jolla facility leases on December 31, 2021, we entered into a lease in August 2020 for approximately 23,000 square feet in San Diego, California for office and laboratory use. The lease commenced on April 1, 2021. The initial lease term is ten years from the lease commencement date, with an option to extend the term for a period of five years.

In San Diego, California, we have leased a warehouse of approximately 19,000 square feet to store the manufacturing equipment from the La Jolla facilities as we build out the manufacturing facility in Massachusetts. The lease expires on June 30,2024.

In Birmingham, Alabama, we have a leased facility of approximately 25,000 square feet to support our amniotic products. It was initially leased through December 31, 2020 and was subsequently extended to December 31, 2022 in the first quarter of 2021.

## ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On December 10, 2021, a class action complaint captioned Somogyi v. Organogenesis Holdings Inc., et al. was filed on behalf of a putative class of all purchasers of our securities from March 17, 2021 through October 11, 2021 against us and our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The complaint alleges violations of federal securities law in connection with alleged false and misleading statements with respect to our billing of the federal government for our Affinity and PuraPly XT products and alleged inducement of doctors to use our Affinity and PuraPly XT products through alleged lucrative reimbursements. The complaint alleges violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, and seeks unquantified damages as well as attorneys' fees, expert fees and other costs. The action is in the early stages of litigation. We believe the claims are without merit and intend to vigorously contest them.

We are not a party to any other material legal proceedings. From time to time, we may become involved in litigation or other legal proceedings relating to claims arising from the ordinary course of business. These matters may include intellectual property, employment and other general claims. With respect to our outstanding legal matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.

## Overview

Organogenesis is a leading regenerative medicine company focused on the development, manufacture, and commercialization of solutions for the Advanced Wound Care and Surgical & Sports Medicine markets. Our products have been shown through clinical and scientific studies to support and in some cases accelerate tissue healing and improve patient outcomes. We are advancing the standard of care in each phase of the healing process through multiple breakthroughs in tissue engineering and cell therapy. Our solutions address large and growing markets driven by aging demographics and increases in comorbidities such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular and peripheral vascular disease and smoking. We offer our differentiated products and in-house customer support to a wide range of health care customers including hospitals, wound care centers, government facilities, ambulatory service centers ("ASCs") and physician offices. Our mission is to provide integrated healing solutions that substantially improve medical outcomes and the lives of patients while lowering the overall cost of care.

We offer a comprehensive portfolio of products in the markets we serve that address patient needs across the continuum of care. We have and intend to continue to generate data from clinical trials, real-world outcomes and health economics research that validate the clinical efficacy and value proposition offered by our products. Several of our existing and pipeline products in our portfolio have PMA approval, or 510(k) clearance from the FDA. Given the extensive time and cost required to conduct clinical trials and receive FDA approvals, we believe that our data and regulatory approvals provide us a strong competitive advantage. Our product development expertise and multiple technology platforms provide a robust product pipeline, which we believe will drive future growth.

In the Advanced Wound Care market, we focus on the development and commercialization of advanced wound care products for the treatment of chronic and acute wounds in various treatment settings. We have a comprehensive portfolio of regenerative medicine products, capable of supporting patients from early in the wound healing process through wound closure regardless of wound type. Our advanced wound care products include Apligraf for the treatment of venous leg ulcers ("VLUs") and diabetic foot ulcers ("DFUs"); Dermagraft for the treatment of DFUs (manufacturing currently suspended pending transition to our Massachusetts based manufacturing facilities); PuraPly AM as an antimicrobial barrier for a broad variety of wound types; and the Affinity, Novachor and NuShield wound coverings to address a variety of wound sizes and types. We have a highly trained and specialized direct wound care sales force paired with comprehensive customer support services.

## Table of Contents

In the Surgical & Sports Medicine market, we focus on products that support the healing of musculoskeletal injuries, including degenerative conditions such as OA and tendonitis. We are leveraging our regenerative medicine capabilities in this attractive, adjacent market. Our Sports Medicine products include NuShield for surgical application in targeted soft tissue repairs; and Affinity, Novachor and PuraPly AM for management of open wounds in the surgical setting. We currently sell these products through independent agencies and our growing direct sales force.

We generated net revenue of $468.1 million, $338.3 million, and $261.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. We reported net income of $94.9 million (which includes a $48.3 million benefit from release of a tax valuation allowance) and $17.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and net loss of $38.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. While we reported net income for the most recent two years, we have incurred significant losses since inception and we may incur operating losses in the future as we expend resources as part of our efforts to grow our organization to support the planned expansion of our business. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $60.1 million. Our primary sources of capital to date have been from sales of our products, borrowings from related parties and institutional lenders and proceeds from the sale of our Class A common stock. We operate in one segment of regenerative medicine.

## COVID-19 pandemic

The emergence of the coronavirus (COVID-19) around the world, and particularly in the United States, continues to present risks to the Company. While the COVID-19 pandemic has not materially adversely affected our financial results and business operations through December 31, 2021, we are unable to predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on our financial position and operating results because of the numerous uncertainties created by the unprecedented nature of the pandemic. We are closely monitoring the evolving impact of the pandemic on all aspects of our business. We have implemented a number of measures designed to protect the health and safety of our employees, support our customers and promote business continuity. We continue to evaluate the Company's liquidity position, communicate with and monitor the actions of our customers and suppliers, and review our near-term financial performance as we manage the Company through this period of uncertainty.

## CPN Acquisition

On September 17, 2020, we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of CPN Biosciences, LLC ("CPN") pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated July 24, 2020. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations . The aggregated consideration amounted to $19.0 million as of the acquisition date which consisted of $6.4 million in cash, 2,151,438 shares of our common stock with a fair value of $8.8 million, and a contingent consideration (the "Earnout") with a fair value at such time of $3.8 million. At the closing, we paid $5.8 million in cash and issued 1,947,953 shares of our Class A common stock. The remaining consideration was held back and will be paid or issued, as applicable, eighteen months after the closing date, subject to any offsetting indemnification claims against CPN. The results of operations of CPN have been included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on the acquisition date.

## Dermagraft

As previously disclosed, as part of our long-term plan to consolidate manufacturing operations in Massachusetts, manufacturing of Dermagraft was suspended in the fourth quarter of 2021 and sales of Dermagraft will be suspended in the second quarter of 2022. We currently plan to transition our Dermagraft manufacturing to our Massachusetts-based manufacturing facilities, which we expect will result in substantial long-term cost savings. In the period when Dermagraft is not available (possibly for a few years), we expect that customers will be willing to substitute Apligraf for Dermagraft and that the suspension of Dermagraft sales will

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

## Table of Contents

not have a material impact on our net revenue. However, if we do not realize the expected substantial long-term cost savings or if customers are unwilling to substitute Apligraf for Dermagraft during the period in which Dermagraft is unavailable, it could have an adverse effect on net revenue and results of operations.

## Management's Use of Non-GAAP Measures

Our management uses financial measures that are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP, in addition to financial measures in accordance with GAAP to evaluate our operating results. These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, our reported financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our operating performance and trends and make planning decisions. Our management believes Adjusted EBITDA helps identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the items that we exclude. Accordingly, we believe that Adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allowing for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by our management in its financial and operational decision-making.

We define EBITDA as net income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, interest expense and income taxes. We define Adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA, further adjusted for the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our core operating performance. These items include non-cash equity compensation, restructuring charges, loss on the extinguishment of debt, mark to market adjustments on our Earnout liability and warrant liability, transaction costs related to a warrant exchange transaction, and CPN acquisition, gain on settlement of deferred acquisition consideration, recovery of certain notes receivable from related parties, write-off of the capitalized costs related to certain unfinished construction work, and the cancellation fee for terminating certain agreements. We have presented Adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measure used by our management and Board of Directors to understand and evaluate our operating performance, generate future operating plans and make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of certain items in calculating Adjusted EBITDA can produce a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our business.

Our Adjusted EBITDA is not prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of Adjusted EBITDA rather than net income (loss), which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations are:

- · Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense as it has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring non-cash expense for our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;
- · Adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and amortization expense and, although these arenon-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated may have to be replaced in the future;
- · Adjusted EBITDA excludes net interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest, which reduces cash available to us;
- · Adjusted EBITDA excludes the impact of the changes in the fair value of our Earnout liability and warrant liability;
- · Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain transactions expenses such as the Company's warrant exchange transaction and the CPN acquisition transaction;
- · Adjusted EBITDA excludes loss on the extinguishment of debt;
- · Adjusted EBITDA excludes charges related to restructuring activities;
- · Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain income associated with the settlement of deferred acquisition consideration and recovery of certain notes receivable from related parties;

## Table of Contents

- · Adjusted EBITDA excludes write-off of the capitalized costs related to certain unfinished construction work;
- · Adjusted EBITDA excludes the cancellation fee for terminating certain agreements;
- · Adjusted EBITDA excludes income tax expense (benefit); and
- · Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.

Because of these limitations, we consider, and you should consider, Adjusted EBITDA together with other operating and financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA from net income (loss), the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, has been included herein.

## Components of Our Consolidated Results of Operations

In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. We believe the items discussed below provide insight into the factors that affect these key measures.

## Revenue

We derive our net revenue from our portfolio of Advanced Wound Care and Surgical & Sports Medicine products. We primarily sell our Advanced Wound Care products through direct sales representatives who manage and maintain the sales relationships with hospitals, wound care centers, government facilities, ASCs and physician offices. We primarily sell our Surgical & Sports Medicine products through third-party agencies.

We recognize revenue from sales of our Advanced Wound Care and Surgical & Sports Medicine products when the customer obtains control of our product, which occurs at a point in time and may be upon procedure date, shipment or delivery, based on the contractual terms of a contract. We record revenue net of a reserve for returns, discounts and GPO rebates, which represent a direct reduction to the revenue we recognize.

Several factors affect our reported revenue in any period, including product, payer and geographic sales mix, operational effectiveness, pricing realization, marketing and promotional efforts, the timing of orders and shipments, regulatory actions including healthcare reimbursement scenarios, competition and business acquisitions.

## Cost of goods sold and gross profit

Cost of goods sold includes personnel costs, product testing costs, quality assurance costs, raw materials and product costs, manufacturing costs, and the costs associated with our manufacturing and warehouse facilities. The increases in our cost of goods sold correspond with the increases in sales units driven by the expansion of our sales force and sales territories, expansion of our product portfolio offerings, and the number of healthcare facilities that offer our products. We expect our cost of goods sold to increase due primarily to anticipated increased sales volumes.

Gross profit is calculated as net revenue less cost of goods sold and generally increases as revenue increases. Our gross profit are affected by product and geographic sales mix, realized pricing of our products, the efficiency of our manufacturing operations and the costs of materials used and fees charged by third-party manufacturers to produce our products. Regulatory actions, including healthcare reimbursement scenarios, which may require costly expenditures or result in pricing pressures, may decrease our gross profit.

## Selling, general and administrative expenses

Selling, general and administrative expenses generally include personnel costs for sales, marketing, sales support, customer support, and general and administrative personnel, sales commissions, incentive compensation,

## Table of Contents

insurance, professional fees, depreciation, amortization, bad debt expense, royalties, information systems costs and costs associated with our administrative facilities. We generally expect our selling, general and administrative expenses to continue to increase due to increased investments in market development and the geographic expansion of our sales forces as we drive for continued revenue growth.

## Research and development expenses

Research and development expenses include personnel costs for our research and development personnel, expenses related to improvements in our manufacturing processes, enhancements to our currently available products, and additional investments in our product and platform development pipeline. Our research and development expenses also include expenses for clinical trials. We expense research and development costs as incurred. We generally expect that research and development expenses will increase as we continue to conduct clinical trials on new and existing products, move products through the regulatory pathway (e.g., seek BLA approval), add personnel to support product enhancements as well as to bring new products to market, and enhance our manufacturing process and procedures.

## Other expense, net

Interest expense -Interest expense consists of interest on our outstanding indebtedness, including amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs, net of interest income recognized.

Loss on the extinguishment of debt -In August 2021, upon entering into the 2021 Credit Agreement, we paid an aggregate amount of $70.6 million associated with the termination of the 2019 Credit Agreement, including unpaid principal, accrued interest, the Final Payment and a prepayment fee. We recognized $1.9 million as loss on the extinguishment of the loan for year ended December 31, 2021. In March 2019, upon entering into the 2019 Credit Agreement, we paid an aggregate amount of $17.6 million associated with the termination of the ML Agreement (as defined below), including unpaid principal, accrued interest and an early termination penalty. We recognized $1.9 million as loss on the extinguishment of the loan.

Change in fair value of warrant liabilityIn connection with the Avista Merger, we issued 4.1 million private warrants to Avista Capital Partners IV, L.P. and Avista Capital Partners IV (Offshore), L.P. on December 10, 2018 (the "Private Warrants"). We classified the warrants as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets as the settlement provisions of the Private Warrants failed the "fixed-for-fixed" rules under ASC815-40-15-7 . The warrant liability was initially recorded at fair value upon issuance and was subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date until the warrants were settled in the warrant exchange transactions in the third quarter of 2019. See Note "13. Stockholders' Equity". Changes in the fair value of the warrant liability were recognized as a component of other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations.

Gain on settlement of deferred acquisition consideration -In February 2020, we settled a dispute on the $5.0 million deferred acquisition consideration with the sellers of NuTech Medical for $4.0 million and assumed from the sellers of NuTech Medical the responsibilities related to a legacy lawsuit of NuTech Medical which was settled in October 2020. In connection with the settlement of this dispute and the legacy lawsuit, we recorded a gain of $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

## Income taxes

We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

In determining whether a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is necessary, we analyze both positive and negative evidence related to the realization of deferred tax assets including projected future taxable income, recent financial results and estimates of future reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition, we consider whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. Based on a consideration of the factors discussed above, in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, we determined it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized in the future and released the valuation allowance on our net U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2021, resulting in a benefit of $48.3 million in income taxes.

Our U.S. provision for income taxes relates to current tax expense associated with taxable income that could not be offset by state net operating losses. We have utilized net operating losses to offset all of the 2021 federal taxable income but have exhausted net operating losses and are subject to limitations in the net operating loss utilization in certain states. We have also recorded a foreign provision for income taxes related to our wholly-owned subsidiary in Switzerland.

We account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements by applyinga two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination by the taxing authorities. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the consolidated financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any resulting tax reserves, or unrecognized tax benefits, that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, net revenue from our Advanced Wound Care products increased by $136.2 million, or 46%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in Advanced Wound Care net revenue was primarily attributable to the expanded sales force, increased sales to existing and new customers, increased adoption of our placental-based product portfolio, including our Affinity product, as well as increased adoption of our PuraPly line extensions launched in the second half of 2020.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, net revenue from our Surgical & Sports Medicine products decreased by $6.5 million, or 15%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease in Surgical & Sports Medicine net revenue was primarily attributable to ReNu and NuCel which we stopped marketing after May 31, 2021 due to the expiration of the FDA's enforcement grace period for these products.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, net revenue from our Advanced Wound Care products increased by $73.9 million, or 33%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in Advanced Wound Care net revenue was primarily attributable to the expanded sales force, increased sales to existing and new customers and increased adoption of our placental-based product portfolio, including our Affinity product.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, net revenue from our Surgical & Sports Medicine products increased by $3.4 million, or 9%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in Surgical & Sports Medicine net revenue was primarily attributable to the expanded sales force and penetration of existing and new customer accounts, partially offset by postponement or cancellation of medical procedures as a result of COVID-19.

Included within net revenue is PuraPly revenue of $198.4 million, $147.3 million, and $126.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. PuraPly exited pass-through status on October 1, 2020. The continued increase in PuraPly revenue in the year ended December 31, 2021 was due to the expanded sales forces, increased adoption, by existing and new customers, of our PuraPly line extensions launched in the second half of 2020 as well as expanded sites of care.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $46.0 million, or 23%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, research and development expenses increased by $10.7 million, or 53%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to increased headcount associated with our existing Advanced Wound Care and Surgical & Sports Medicine products, an increase in product costs associated with our pipeline products not yet commercialized and an increase in the clinical study and related costs necessary to seek regulatory approvals for certain of our products.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, research and development expenses increased by $5.3 million, or 36%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an increase in process development costs associated with a new contract manufacturer, increased headcount associated with our existing Advanced Wound Care and Surgical & Sports Medicine products, an increase in product costs associated with our pipeline products not yet commercialized and an increase in the clinical study and related costs necessary to seek regulatory approvals for certain of our products.

## ** not meaningful

For the year ended December 31, 2021, total other expense, net, increased by $0.2 million or 2%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest expense decreased by $4.0 million or 36% primarily due to the reduced interest rate for borrowings under the 2021 Credit Agreement. Loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.9 million was related to loss recognized on the extinguishment of the 2019 Credit Agreement upon repayment in August 2021. The gain of $2.2 million on the settlement of deferred acquisition consideration was related to the settlement of the deferred acquisition consideration dispute with the sellers of NuTech Medical in February 2020 as well as the decrease in legal accruals related to the settlement in October 2020 of a legacy lawsuit which we assumed from the sellers of NuTech Medical as part of the resolution of the aforementioned dispute.

For the year ended December 31, 2020, other expense, net, increased by $0.2 million or 3%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest expense increased by $2.3 million or 25% primarily due to the increased borrowings under the 2019 Credit Agreement. Change in fair value of warrant liability of $2.1 million in 2019 reflected the decrease in the fair value of warrant liability when it was settled in the warrant exchange transaction in the third quarter of 2019. Loss on the extinguishment of debt of $1.9 million in 2019 reflected the write-off of unamortized debt discount upon repayment of the Master Lease Agreement as well as early payment penalties in March 2019. Gain of $2.2 million in 2020 was related to the settlement of the deferred acquisition consideration dispute with the sellers of NuTech Medical in February 2020 as well as the settlement in October 2020 of a legacy lawsuit which we assumed from the sellers of NuTech Medical as part of the resolution of the aforementioned dispute.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, income tax (expense) benefit decreased by $31.6 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease is due to the deferred tax benefit of $32.0 million primarily resulting from the release of the valuation allowance previously recorded against the full amount of our net U.S. deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2021. See Note "15. Income Taxes".

For the year ended December 31, 2020, income tax (expense) benefit increased by $0.4 million, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily due to the cash tax expected in states where net operating loss utilization is limited.

## Liquidity and Capital Resources

Since our inception, we have funded our operations and capital expenditures through cash flows from product sales, loans from affiliates and entities controlled by certain of our affiliates, third-party debt and proceeds from the sale of our capital stock. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $60.1 million and working capital of $145.0 million which includes $113.9 million in cash and cash equivalents. We also had $125.0 million available for future revolving borrowings under our Revolving Facility (see Note "12. Long-Term Debt Obligations"). For the year ended December 31, 2021, we have reported $94.9 million of net income and $62.0 million of cash flows from operating activities. We expect that our cash on hand and other components of working capital as of December 31, 2021, availability under the 2021 Credit Agreement, plus net cash flows from product sales, will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditure requirements and debt service payments for at least 12 months beyond the filing date of this annual report.

We continue to closely monitor ongoing developments in connection withthe COVID-19 pandemic, which may negatively impact our commercial prospects, cash position and access to capital in fiscal 2022 or beyond. We will continue to assess our cash and other sources of liquidity and, if circumstances warrant, we will make appropriate adjustments to our operating plan. Please see "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for an additional discussion of risks.

Our primary uses of cash are working capital requirements, capital expenditure and debt service payments. Additionally, from time to time, we may use capital for acquisitions and other investing and financing activities. Working capital is used principally for our personnel as well as manufacturing costs related to the production of our products. Our working capital requirements vary from period to period depending on manufacturing volumes, the timing of shipments and the payment cycles of our customers and payers. Our capital expenditures consist primarily of building improvements, manufacturing equipment, computer hardware and software.

To the extent additional funds are necessary to meet our long-term liquidity needs as we continue to execute our business strategy, we anticipate that they will be obtained through additional equity or debt financings, other strategic transactions or a combination of these potential sources of funds. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funds on terms acceptable to us, on a timely basis or at all.

The following table presents our cash and outstanding debt as of the dates indicated:

The net cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by the payment of finance lease obligations of $2.4 million, the payment of $3.5 million related to the NuTech Medical deferred acquisition consideration and the net debt repayment of $13.5 million under our 2019 Credit Agreement.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $78.7 million that consisted primarily of $56.1 million in net proceeds from the 2019 Credit Agreement, $47.4 million in net proceeds from the issuance of Class A common stock and $0.9 million in proceeds from the exercise of warrants and options. The net cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by the payment of the put option on redeemable Class A common stock of $6.8 million, repayment of the ML Agreement of $17.6 million, and payment of finance lease obligations of $1.3 million.

## 2021 Credit Agreement

In August 2021, we and our subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement with SVB and several other lenders, which we refer to as the 2021 Credit Agreement. The 2021 Credit Agreement provides for a term loan facility not to exceed $75,000 (the "Term Loan Facility") and a revolving credit facility not to exceed $125,000 (the "Revolving Facility").

Advances made under the 2021 Credit Agreement may be either Eurodollar Loans or ABR Loans, at our option. For Eurodollar Loans, the interest rate is a per annum interest rate equal to LIBOR plus an Applicable Margin based on the Total Net Leverage Ratio. For ABR Loans, the interest rate is equal to (1) the highest of (a) the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate, (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50% and (c) the LIBOR rate plus 1.0%, plus (2) an Applicable Margin based on the Total Net Leverage Ratio.

## Table of Contents

The 2021 Credit Agreement requires us to make consecutive quarterly installment payments of principal in an amount equal to between 0.625% to 2.50% of the original principal amount of the Term Loans starting from September 30, 2021 through August 6, 2026 (the "Term Loan Maturity Date"). We may prepay the Term Loan Facility, provided that any Term Loans prepaid prior to August 6, 2022, must be accompanied by a prepayment premium equal to 1.00% of the aggregate amount of Term Loans prepaid. Once repaid, amounts borrowed under the Term Loan Facility may not be re-borrowed.

We must pay a quarterly fee in arrears (the "Commitment Fee"), for theCompany's non-use of available funds through August 6, 2026 (the "Revolving Termination Date"). The Commitment Fee rate is based on the Total Net Leverage Ratio. We may elect to reduce or terminate the Revolving Facility in its entirety at any time by repaying all outstanding principal, unpaid accrued interest and, with respect to any such reduction or termination of the Revolving Commitments made prior to August 6, 2022, 1.00% of the aggregate amount of the Revolving Commitments so reduced or terminated.

Under the 2021 Credit Agreement, we are required to comply with certain financial covenants including the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, tested quarterly. In addition, we are also required to make representations and warranties and comply with certain non-financial covenants that are customary in loan agreements of this type, including restrictions on the payment of dividends, repurchase of stock, incurrence of indebtedness, dispositions and acquisitions.

As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the covenants under the 2021 Credit Agreement. We had outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility and Term Loan Facility of the 2021 Credit Agreement of $0.0 million and $74.1 million, respectively.

## 2019 Credit Agreement

In March 2019, we, our subsidiaries and SVB, and the several other lenders thereto entered into a credit agreement, as amended (the "2019 Credit Agreement"), providing for a term loan facility of $40,000 and a revolving credit facility of up to $60,000. Both facilities were set to mature in 2024. The interest rate for the term loan facility was a floating per annum interest rate equal to the greater of 3.75% above the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate and 9.25%. The interest rate for advances under the revolving facility was a floating per annum interest rate equal to the greater of the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate and 5.50%. If we elected to prepay the loan or terminate the facilities, we were required to pay a certain percentage of the outstanding principal as a prepayment fee. A final payment fee (the "Final Payment") of 6.5% multiplied by the original aggregate principal amount of term loan facility was due upon the earlier to occur, the maturity date of the term loan or prepayment of all outstanding principal.

In August 2021, upon entering into the 2021 Credit Agreement, we paid an aggregate amount of $70.6 million due under the 2019 Credit Agreement, including unpaid principal, accrued interest, the Final Payment and a prepayment fee, with proceeds from the 2021 Credit Agreement, and the 2019 Credit Agreement was terminated. Upon termination of the 2019 Credit Agreement, the Company recognized $1.9 million as loss on the extinguishment of the loan for year ended December 31, 2021.

## Master Lease Agreement

In April 2017, we entered into the Master Lease Agreement (the "ML Agreement") with Eastward Fund Management LLC. In March 2019, upon entering into the 2019 Credit Agreement, we paid an aggregate amount of $17.6 million due under the ML Agreement with proceeds from the 2019 Credit Agreement, and the ML Agreement was terminated. Upon termination of the ML Agreement, we recognized $1.9 million as loss on the extinguishment of the loan.

## Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and the disclosure at the date of the financial statements, as well as revenue and expenses recorded during the reporting periods. Management bases its estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could materially change our results from those reported. Management evaluates its estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis. Historically, our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results. However, if our assumptions change, we may need to revise our estimates or take other corrective actions, either of which may also have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statements of operations, liquidity and financial condition.

We believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant areas where management applies judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.

## Revenue Recognition

We generate revenue through the sale of Advanced Wound Care and Surgical & Sports Medicine products. There is a single performance obligation in all of our contracts, which is our promise to transfer our product to customers based on specific payment and shipping terms in the arrangement. The entire transaction price is allocated to this single performance obligation. Product revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of our product which occurs at a point in time and may be upon shipment, procedure date, or delivery, based on the terms of the contract. Revenue is recorded net of a reserve for returns, discounts and GPO rebates, which represent a direct reduction to the revenue we recognize. These reductions are accrued at the time revenue is recognized, based upon historical experience and specific circumstances.

## Accounts Receivable, Net

Accounts receivables are stated at invoice value less estimated allowances for doubtful accounts. We continually monitor customer payments and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from our customers' inability to make required payments. We consider factors such as historical experience, credit quality, age of the accounts receivable balances, geography-related risks and economic conditions that may affect a customer's ability to pay. In cases where there are circumstances that may impair a specific customer's ability to meet its financial obligations, a specific allowance is recorded against amounts due, and thereby reduces the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably believed to be collectible. Accounts receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts receivables previously written off are recorded when received.

## Inventory

Inventory is stated at the lower of cost (determined under the first-in first-out method) or net realizable value. Inventory includes raw materials, work in process and finished goods. It also includes cell banks and the cost of tests mandated by regulatory agencies, of the materials to qualify them for production.

We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision to write down excess and obsolete inventory to its estimated net realizable value based upon management's assumptions of future material usage, yields and obsolescence, which are a result of future demand and market conditions and the effective life of certain inventory items. Our excess and obsolete inventory review process includes analysis of sales forecasts and historical sales as compared to inventory on hand and working with operations to maximize recovery of excess inventory. The estimate of excess quantities is subjective and primarily dependent on our estimate of

## Table of Contents

future demand for a particular product. If the estimate of future demand is inaccurate based on actual sales, we may increase the write-down for excess inventory for that component.

## Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually (as of December 31), or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may no longer be recoverable and that an impairment loss may have occurred. Circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, or unanticipated competition. We operate as one segment, which is considered to be the sole reporting unit, and therefore goodwill is tested for impairment at the consolidated level.

In accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other , we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, we determine that it is more likely than not (i.e. greater than 50% likelihood) that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. The quantitative goodwill impairment test requires us to estimate and compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets, goodwill is not impaired. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss up to the amount of goodwill.

Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgments, including a qualitative assessment to determine whether there are any impairment indicators, and determining the fair value of the reporting unit which often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. There is no assurance that the actual future earnings or cash flows of the reporting unit will not decline significantly from the projections used in the impairment analysis. Goodwill impairment charges may be recognized in future periods to the extent changes in factors or circumstances occur, including deterioration in the macroeconomic environment and industry, deterioration in the Company's performance or its future projections, or changes in plans for its reporting unit.

There were no impairment charges of goodwill recorded during 2021, 2020, and 2019.

## Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We review other long-lived assets (including identifiable definite lived intangible assets) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the useful life is shorter than originally estimated or the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If such facts and circumstances exist, we assess the recoverability of the identified assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives to their respective carrying amounts. Impairments, if any, are based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets and occur in the period in which the impairment determination is made.

There were no impairments of long-lived assets recorded during 2021, 2020, and 2019.

## Income Taxes

We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

## Table of Contents

In determining whether a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is necessary, we analyze both positive and negative evidence related to the realization of deferred tax assets including projected future taxable income, recent financial results and estimates of future reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition, we consider whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we determined it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized in the future and released the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2021, resulting in a benefit of $48.3 million in income taxes.

We account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the consolidated financial statements by applyinga two-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination by the taxing authorities. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the consolidated financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any resulting tax reserves, or unrecognized tax benefits, that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.

## Valuation of Contingent Purchase Earnout

In connection with our acquisition of CPN Biosciences, LLC ("CPN"), we recognized anon-current liability, at the time of the acquisition in 2020, for the fair value of the contingent consideration (the "Earnout"). The Earnout liability is classified as a Level 3 measurement for which fair value is derived from inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. The fair value of such Earnout liability is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model that utilizes key assumptions including forecasted revenues and volatilities of the underlying financial metrics during the Earnout period. We assess the fair value of the Earnout liability at each reporting period. Any subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the liability are reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses until the liability is settled.

## Stock-Based Compensation

We measure stock-based awards granted based on the fair value of the awards on the date of grant and recognize compensation expense for those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Generally, we issue stock-based awards with only service-based vesting conditions and record the expense for these awards using the straight-line method. We have not issued any stock-based awards with performancebased vesting conditions.

We recognize stock-based compensation expense within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations for all share-based payments based upon the estimated grant-date fair value for the awards expected to ultimately vest.

The fair value of each restricted stock unit is based on the fair market value of our Class A common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We have been a public company for a short period of time, have limited public float and lack company-specific historical and implied volatility information for our Class A common stock. Therefore, we estimate our expected stock price volatility based on the historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies and expect to continue to do so until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our own traded stock price. The expected term of our stock options has been determined utilizing the "simplified" method for awards that qualify as "plain-vanilla" options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends on Class A common stock and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.

For a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and the estimated effects, if any, on our consolidated financial statements, see Note "2. Significant Accounting Policies" to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to various market risks, including fluctuations in interest rates and variability in currency exchange rates. We have established policies, procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risk.

## Interest Rate Risk

As of December 31, 2021, we had $74.1 million and $0.0 million of borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and the Revolving Facility, respectively. Borrowings under our 2021 Credit Agreement bear interest at variable rates. Based on the principal amount outstanding as of December 31, 2021, an immediate 10% change in the interest rate would not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

## Foreign Currency and Market Risk

The majority of our employees and our major operations are currently located in the United States. The functional currency of our foreign subsidiary in Switzerland is the U.S. dollar. We have, in the normal course of business, engaged in contracts with contractors or other vendors in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. To date, we have had minimal exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as the time period from the date that transactions are initiated and the date of payment or receipt of payment is generally of short duration. Accordingly, we believe we do not have a material exposure to foreign currency risk.

## ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

## Evaluation of the Company's Disclosure Controls

The Company's management, with the participation of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2021. The term "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,

## Table of Contents

summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the rules and forms promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that, as of December 31, 2021, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because our internal control over financial reporting has not been operating effectively for a reasonable period of time.

## Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer and effected by the Company's board of directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and includes those policies and procedures that:

- (1) Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets;
- (2) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the issuer are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors; and
- (3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the issuer's assets that could have a material effect on the issuer's consolidated financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Accordingly, even effective internal control over financial reporting can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in the SEC guidance on conducting such assessments as of the end of the period covered by this report. Management conducted the assessment based on certain criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. As a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on those criteria.

As disclosed in the Company's annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, our management team identified the following material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting: we did not design and maintain formal accounting, business operations, and information technology policies, procedures and controls to achieve complete, accurate and timely financial accounting, reporting and disclosures, including (i) formalized policies and procedures for reviews over account reconciliations, journal entries, and other accounting analyses, memos and procedures to ensure completeness and accuracy of information used in these

## Table of Contents

review controls and (ii) controls to support the objectives of proper segregation of the initiation of transactions, the recording of transactions, and the custody of assets.

Although management has made significant progress in remediating this material weakness, management concluded that the material weakness described above continued to exist as of December 31, 2021. Specifically, when validating the operating effectiveness of certain controls over financial reporting to gain assurance that such controls are present and functioning as designed, management identified deficiencies that indicate a lack of sustainability and inconsistent application of certain policies, procedures, and controls, including the proper segregation of duties, exacerbated in part by turnover within key positions during the year.

Management has taken actions to remediate the deficiencies in its internal controls over financial reporting and implemented additional processes and controls designed to address the underlying causes associated with the above-mentioned material weakness. Management is committed to finalizing the remediation of the material weakness during 2022. Management's internal control remediation efforts include the following:

- · In 2021, we planned the implementation of a new company-wide enterprise resource planning, or ERP, system to provide additional systematic controls and segregation of duties for our accounting processes.Due, in part, to turnover in key positions, our enterprise resource planning system go live date has been delayed. We anticipate the ERP system going live in 2022.
- · We have continued to train and cross train our employees on their internal control responsibilities and how to best support the Company if personnel turnover issues within their departments occur. We have also supplemented our internal resources with third-party resources, where necessary.
- · We have continued to engage an outside firm to assist management with performing control operating effectiveness testing throughout the year
- · We regularly reported the results of control testing to the key stakeholders across the organization, including the audit committee, on testing progress and defined corrective actions, and we monitored and reported on the results of control remediation. Through these actions, we have continued to strengthen our internal policies, processes, and reviews.

As management continues to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, management may determine it is necessary to take additional measures to address the material weakness. However, we believe the above actions will be effective in remediating the material weaknesses and we will continue to devote significant time and attention to these remediation efforts. Until the controls have been operating for a sufficient period of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are executed consistently and operating effectively, the material weakness described above will continue to exist.

## Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting other than those described above related to remediation efforts. However, as the implementation of the new ERP system commences in 2022, we will change our processes and procedures, which in turn, could result in changes to our internal control over financial reporting. As such changes occur, we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.

## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Organogenesis Holdings Inc.

## Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Organogenesis Holdings Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, redeemable common stock and stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the financial statements). We have also audited, the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in 2013.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in management's assessment: Management did not design and maintain formal accounting, business operations, and information technology policies, procedures and controls to achieve complete, accurate and timely financial accounting, reporting and disclosures, including (i) formalized policies and procedures for reviews over account reconciliations, journal entries, and other accounting analyses, memos and procedures to ensure completeness and accuracy of information used in these review controls and (ii) controls to support the objectives of proper segregation of the initiation of transactions, the recording of transactions, and the custody of assets. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2021 financial statements and our opinion regarding the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting does not affect our opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

## Change in accounting principle

As discussed in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for leases in 2021.

## Basis for Opinions

The Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in management's report referred to above. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company's consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

## Table of Contents

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

## Realizability of Deferred Tax Assets

As described in Notes 2 and 15 of the financial statements, as of December 31, 2021, the Company's deferred tax assets, before valuation allowance, were $47.9 million, and during the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a deferred tax benefit of $48.3 million related to the reduction of a previously established valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. The Company assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be realizable from the generation of future taxable income and, to the extent it believes, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets

will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established through a charge to income tax expense. In making the determination of the realizability of deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance, management analyzes all available positive and negative evidence, including estimates of projected future taxable income, recent financial results and estimates of future reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities.

We identified the Company's evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets as a critical audit matter because of the significant assumptions and judgments used by management in considering all positive and negative evidence, including projections of future taxable income and estimates of future reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Auditing management's assumptions and judgements regarding the realizability of the Company's deferred tax assets involved a high degree of auditor judgment and increased audit effort, including the use of our income tax professionals, due to the impact these assumptions and judgments have on the valuation allowance analysis.

Our audit procedures related to the estimates and assumptions used in the Company's evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets included the following, among others:

- · We obtained an understanding of the relevant controls related to the realizability of deferred tax assets and tested such controls for design and operating effectiveness, including controls over management's evaluation of the positive and negative evidence such as future reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities and projections of future taxable income.
- · We tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by management in developing the projections of future taxable income.
- · With the assistance of our income tax professionals, we evaluated the reasonableness of the Company's projections of future taxable income, including the taxable income by tax jurisdiction, by comparing the projections to historical results.
- · With the assistance of our income tax professionals, we evaluated the estimated future reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities by:
- · Recalculating the underlying schedule of reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities.
- · Confirming that the expected reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the actual amounts that would reverse in a particular year or are reasonably supported by the nature of the reversing item and period in which the item would be deductible or taxable.
- · Evaluating the reasonableness of management's analysis that the reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities are supported by the appropriate tax law.

## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts)

## 1. Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation

Organogenesis Holdings Inc. (formerly Avista Healthcare Public Acquisition Corp.) ("ORGO" or the "Company") is a leading regenerative medicine company focused on the development, manufacture, and commercialization of solutions for the Advanced Wound Care and Surgical & Sports Medicine markets. Several of the existing and pipeline products in the Company's portfolio have Premarket Application ("PMA") approval, or Premarket Notification 510(k) clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"). The Company's customers include hospitals, wound care centers, government facilities, ambulatory service centers ("ASCs") and physician offices. The Company has one operating and reportable segment.

## COVID-19 pandemic

The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic around the world, and particularly in the United States, continues to present significant risks to the Company. While the COVID-19 pandemic has not materially adversely affected the Company's financial results and business operations through the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company is unable to predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on its financial position and operating results because of the numerous uncertainties created by the unprecedented nature of the pandemic. The Company is closely monitoring the evolving impact of the pandemic on all aspects of its business. The Company has implemented a number of measures designed to protect the health and safety of its employees, support its customers and promote business continuity.

## 2. Significant Accounting Policies

## Revision to Previously Issued Financial Statements

## Private Warrant Reclassification

On April 12, 2021, the Staff of the SEC issued a statement regarding the accounting and reporting considerations for warrants issued by special purpose acquisition companies entitled "Staff Statement on Accounting and Reporting Considerations for Warrants Issued by Special Purpose Acquisition Companies ("SPACs")" (the "SEC Statement"). In the SEC Statement, the SEC Staff expressed its view that certain terms and conditions common to SPAC warrants may require the warrants to be classified as liabilities on the SPAC's financial statements as opposed to equity.

As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 4.1 million private warrants outstanding, which were issued to Avista Capital Partners IV, L.P. and Avista Capital Partners IV (Offshore), L.P. in connection with the Avista Merger on December 10, 2018 (the "Private Warrants"), and 31.0 million public warrants outstanding that were issued in connection with the initial public offering of Avista Healthcare Public Acquisition Corp. on October 10, 2016 (the "Public Warrants", together with the Private Warrants, the "Warrants"). The Company originally classified the Warrants as equity on its financial statements. In 2019, the outstanding Warrants were exchanged for 3.3 million shares of the Company's Class A common stock (see Note "13. Stockholders' Equity". There were no Warrants outstanding as of December 31, 2019.

As a result of the SEC Statement, the Company reevaluated the historical accounting treatment of its Public Warrants and Private Warrants and determined that the Private Warrants should have been recorded at fair value as a liability in the Company's consolidated balance sheet with changes to the fair value recorded to the consolidated statements of operations. The Company assessed the materiality of this error on prior period financial statements in accordance with the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Number 99, Materiality, and

ASC 250-10, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. The Company determined that this error was not material to the financial statements of any prior annual or interim period.

## Right of Use Asset Amortization

In August 2021, the Company identified an error in its accounting treatment for two assets recorded as finance leases. The Company did not record amortization expenses for these assets since the lease commencement date. This error resulted in an overstatement of property and equipment, net, and an understatement of accumulated deficit, and selling, general and administrative expenses in the financial statements included in the Company's quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and the Company's annual reports on Form 10-K previously filed with the SEC. The Company assessed the materiality of this error on prior period financial statements in accordance with the SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin Number 99, Materiality, and ASC 250-10, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. The Company determined that this error was not material to the financial statements of any prior annual or interim period.

To correct the misstatements above, the Company revised its previously issued financial statements as follows:

## Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported results of operations during the reporting periods. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the estimates and assumptions that management consider to be significant and that present the greatest amount of uncertainty include revenue recognition; sales returns and credit losses; inventory reserve; recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities; the assessment of recoverability of long-lived and indefinite lived assets (including intangible assets), assessing impairment of goodwill; valuation of assets and liabilities that use unobservable inputs, and the valuation and recognition of stock-based compensation. Actual results and outcomes may differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions.

## Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and results of operations of Organogenesis Holdings Inc., and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

## Segment Reporting

Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which discrete financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance for the organization. The Company's chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer. The Company's chief operating decision maker reviews consolidated operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Accordingly, the Company has determined that it has a single operating segment-regenerative medicine.

## Table of Contents

The Company manages its operations as a single operating segment for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions. The Company's portfolio includes regenerative medicine products in various stages, ranging from preclinical to late stage development, and commercialized advanced wound care and surgical and sports medicine products which support healing across a wide variety of wound types at many different types of facilities.

## Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company primarily maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts in the United States which, at times, may exceed the federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to significant credit risk on cash. The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

## Restricted Cash

The Company had restricted cash of $599 and $412 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Restricted cash represents employee deposits in connection with the Company's health benefit plan.

## Accounts Receivable, Net

Accounts receivable are stated at invoice value less estimated allowances for doubtful accounts. The Company continually monitors customer payments and maintains a reserve for estimated losses resulting from its customers' inability to make required payments. The Company considers factors when estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts such as historical experience, credit quality, age of the accounts receivable balances, geography-related risks and economic conditions that may affect a customer's ability to pay. In cases where there are circumstances that may impair a specific customer's ability to meet its financial obligations, a specific allowance is recorded against amounts due, thereby reducing the net recognized receivable to the amount reasonably believed to be collectible. Accounts receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts receivables previously written off are recorded when received.

## Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (determined under thefirst-in first-out method) or net realizable value. Work in process and finished goods include materials, labor and allocated overhead. Inventories also include cell banks and the cost of tests mandated by regulatory agencies of the materials to qualify them for production.

The Company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision to write down excess and obsolete inventory to its estimated net realizable value based upon management's assumptions of future material usage, yields and obsolescence, which are a result of future demand and market conditions and the effective life of certain inventory items.

The Company also tests other components of its inventory for future growth projections. The Company determines the average yield of the component and compares it to projected revenue to ensure it is properly reserved.

## Property and Equipment, Net

Property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets on a straight-line basis. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company's property and equipment

consisted of leasehold improvements, building, furniture and computers, and equipment.Property and equipment's estimated useful lives are as follows:

Table of Contents

| Leasehold improvements   | Lesser of the life of the lease or the economic life of the asset   |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Building                 | 30 years                                                            |
| Furniture and computers  | 3-5 years                                                           |
| Equipment                | 5-10 years                                                          |

Upon retirement or sale, the cost of assets disposed of, and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the consolidated statement of operations. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Expenditures for major improvements that extend the useful lives of the related asset are capitalized and depreciated over their remaining estimated useful lives. Construction in progress costs are capitalized when incurred until the assets are placed in service, at which time the costs will be transferred to the related property and equipment, and depreciated over their respective useful lives.

## Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually (as of December 31), or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may no longer be recoverable and that an impairment loss may have occurred. Circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include, but are not limited to, a ++significant adverse change in the business climate or legal factors, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, or unanticipated competition. The Company operates as one segment, which is considered to be the sole reporting unit, and therefore goodwill is tested for impairment at the consolidated level.

In accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the Company determines that it is more likely than not (i.e. greater than 50% likelihood) that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is needed. Alternatively, the Company can bypass the qualitative test and proceed directly to the quantitative test. The quantitative goodwill impairment test requires the Company to estimate and compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, goodwill is not impaired. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss up to the amount of goodwill.

There was no impairment of goodwill recorded during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, or 2019.

## Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization

Intangible assets include intellectual property either owned by the Company or for which the Company has a license. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognized at fair value using generally accepted valuation methods deemed appropriate for the type of intangible asset acquired. Intangible assets are reported net of accumulated amortization, separately from goodwill. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets include developed technology and patents, trade names, trademarks, customer relationships and non-compete agreements obtained through business acquisitions. Amortization of intangible assets with finite lives is calculated on the straight-line or accelerated method based on the following estimated useful lives:

| Trade names and trademarks   | 1-12 years   |
|------------------------------|--------------|
| Developed technology         | 6-12 years   |
| Customer relationships       | 10 years     |
| Non-compete agreements       | 5 years      |

## Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

Long-lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment and intangible assets. The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Factors that the Company considers in deciding when to perform an impairment review include, but not limited to, significant underperformance of the business in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in the use of the assets. When such an event occurs, the Company determines whether there has been impairment by comparing the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows to the related asset group's carrying value. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the asset is written down to fair value, which is determined based either on discounted cash flows or appraised value, depending on the nature of the asset. The Company did not record any impairment of long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, or 2019.

## Deferred Offering Costs

The Company capitalizes certain legal, professional accounting and other third-party fees that are directly associated within-process equity financings as deferred offering costs until such financings are consummated. After consummation of the equity financing, these costs are recorded in stockholders' equity (deficit) as a reduction of proceeds generated as a result of the offering. Should the planned equity financing be abandoned, the deferred offering costs will be expensed immediately as a charge to operating expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.

The Company did not record any deferred offering costs in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded $4,647 and $3,510 of equity issuance costs to additionalpaid-in capital against proceeds received from the 2020 and 2019 Underwritten Public Offering, respectively (see Note "13. Stockholders' Equity").

## Revenue Recognition

## Product Revenue

The Company generates revenue through the sale of Advanced Wound Care and Surgical & Sports Medicine products. There is a single performance obligation in all of the Company's contracts, which is the Company's promise to transfer the Company's product to customers based on specific payment and shipping terms in the arrangement. The entire transaction price is allocated to this single performance obligation. Product revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of the Company's product which occurs at a point in time and may be upon shipment, procedure date, or delivery, based on the terms of the contract.

## Reserves for Variable Consideration

Revenues from product sales are recorded net of reserves for variable consideration which includes but is not limited to product return, discounts, rebates and group purchasing organization ("GPO") fees that are offered within contracts between the Company and its customers relating to the Company's sales of its products. These reserves are based on the amounts earned or to be claimed by its customers on the related sales and are recorded as a reduction of accounts receivable or an establishment of a liability. Where appropriate, these estimates take into consideration a range of possible outcomes which are probability-weighted for relevant factors such as the Company's historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and forecasted customer buying and payment patterns. Overall, these reserves reflect the Company's best estimates of the amount of consideration to which it is entitled based on the terms of the contract and is included in the net sales price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur in a future period. Actual amounts of consideration ultimately paid may differ from the Company's estimates. If actual results vary from the Company's estimates, the Company adjusts these estimates, which would affect net product revenue and earnings in the period such variances become known.

## Product Returns

Consistent with industry practice, the Company generally offers customers a limited right of return for product purchased. The Company estimates the amount of its product sales that may be returned by its customers and records this estimate as a reduction of revenue in the period the related product revenue is recognized. The Company currently estimates product return reserves using its historical return rates as well as factors that it becomes aware of that it believes could significantly impact its expected returns, including product recalls, pricing changes, or change in reimbursement rates. The Company does not record an asset for the returned product as the product is discarded upon receipt.

## Rebates and Allowances

The Company provides certain customers with rebates and allowances that are explicitly stated in the Company's contracts, resulting in a reduction of revenue and the establishment of a liability that is included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets in the period the related product revenue is recognized.

## GPO Fees

The Company pays fees to GPOs for administrative services that the GPOs perform in connection with the purchases of the product by the GPO members. These fees are based on a contractually-determined percentage of the Company's applicable sales. The Company classifies these GPO fees as a reduction of revenue based on the substance of the relationship of all parties involved in the transaction. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company recorded GPO fees of $2,963, $3,572, and $3,096, respectively, as a direct reduction of revenue.

## Other Revenue Policies

Sales, value add, and other taxes collected on behalf of third parties are excluded from revenue.

Applying the practical expedient in paragraph ASC 606-10-32-18, the Company does not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract inception is such that the period between payment by the customer and the transfer of the promised products to the customer will be one year or less, which is the case with substantially all customers.

Applying the practical expedient in ASC 340-40-25-4, the Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the assets that the Company otherwise would have recognized is one year or less. These costs are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses.

Applying the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-25-18B, the Company accounts for shipping and handling activities related to contracts with customers as costs to fulfill the promise to transfer the associated products. The Company records the related costs as part of the cost of goods sold.

## Disaggregation of Revenue

## Table of Contents

For all periods presented, net revenue generated outside the United States represented less than 1% of total net revenue.

## Stock-Based Compensation

The Company measures stock-based awards granted based on the fair value of the awards on the date of grant and recognizes compensation expense for those awards over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Generally, the Company issues stock-based awards with only service-based vesting conditions and records the expense for these awards using the straight-line method. The Company has not issued any stock-based awards with performance-based vesting conditions.

The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations for all share-based payments based upon the estimated grant-date fair value for the awards expected to ultimately vest.

The fair value of each restricted stock unit grant is based on the fair market value of the Company's stock on the date of grant. The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company has been a public company for a short period of time, has limited public float and lacks company-specific historical and implied volatility information for its stock. Therefore, it estimates its expected stock price volatility based on the historical volatility of publicly traded peer companies and expects to continue to do so until such time as it has adequate historical data regarding the volatility of its own traded stock price. The expected term of the Company's stock options has been determined utilizing the "simplified" method for awards that qualify as "plain-vanilla" options. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is based on the fact that the Company has never paid cash dividends on its Class A common stock and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

## Advertising

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. Advertising costs were approximately $5,522, $2,722, and $1,059 for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

## Research and Development Costs

Research and development expenses include personnel costs for the Company's research and development personnel, expenses related to improvements to manufacturing processes, enhancements to the Company's currently available products, and additional investments in the product and platform development pipeline. Research and development expenses also include expenses for clinical trials. The Company expenses research and development costs as incurred.

## Foreign Currency

The Company's functional currency, including the Company's Swiss subsidiary, Organogenesis GmbH, is the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency gains and losses resulting from re-measurement of assets and liabilities held in foreign currencies and transactions settled in a currency other than the functional currency are included separately as non-operating income or expense in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of other expense, net. The foreign currency amounts recorded for all periods presented were insignificant.

## Valuation of Contingent Purchase Earnout

In connection with the acquisition of CPN Biosciences, LLC ("CPN"), the Company recognized anon-current liability for the fair value of the contingent consideration (the "Earnout") at the time of the acquisition in 2020. The Earnout liability is classified as a Level 3 measurement for which fair value is derived from inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. The fair value of such Earnout liability is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model that utilizes key assumptions including forecasted revenues and volatilities of the underlying financial metrics during the Earnout period. The Company assesses the fair value of the Earnout liability at each reporting period. Any subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the liability are reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses until the liability is settled.

## Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements or in the Company's tax returns. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the consolidated financial statement and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the provision for income taxes. The Company quarterly assesses the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent it believes, based upon the weight of available evidence, that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established through a charge to income tax expense. In determining whether a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is necessary, we analyze both positive and negative evidence related to the realization of deferred tax assets , including projected future taxable income, recent financial results and estimates of future reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we determined it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized in the future and released the valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2021, resulting in a benefit of $48.3 million in income taxes. See Note "15. Income Taxes."

The Company accounts for uncertain income tax positions recognized in the consolidated financial statements by applying atwo-step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized. First, the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination by the taxing authorities. If the tax position is deemed more-likely-than-not to be sustained, the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the consolidated financial statements. The amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any resulting tax reserves, or unrecognized tax benefits, that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.

## Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Certain assets and liabilities of the Company are carried at fair value under GAAP. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three levels of the fair value hierarchy, of which the first two are considered observable and the last is considered unobservable:

- · Level 1-Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
- · Level 2-Observable inputs (other than Level 1 quoted prices), such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active for identical or similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.

## Table of Contents

- · Level 3-Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity that are significant to determining the fair value of the assets or liabilities, including pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques.

The carrying values of accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities. The fair value of the Earnout liability was carried at fair value, determined according to Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy described above (see Note "4. Fair Value Measurement of Financial Instruments"). The carrying values of outstanding borrowings under the Company's debt arrangements "12. Long-Term Debt Obligations") approximate their fair values as determined based on a discounted cash flow model, which represents a Level 3 measurement.

## Net Income (Loss) per Share

The Company determines net income (loss) per share in accordance with the authoritative guidance in ASC Topic 260, Earnings Per Share . The Company has one class of common stock (Class A common stock) for purposes of the net income (loss) per share calculation and therefore computes basic net income (loss) per share by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the applicable period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed in the same manner as basic net income (loss) per share, except that the number of shares is computed by giving effect to all potential dilutive common shares. For purpose of this calculation, outstanding stock options, warrants to purchase shares of Class A common stock and unvested restricted stock are considered potential dilutive common shares.

## Emerging Growth Company

Before December 31, 2021, the Company was an "emerging growth company," as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period afforded by the JOBS Act for the implementation of new or revised accounting standards. The Company elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards (such as ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842)) and, as a result of this election, the Company's financial statements prior to 2021 may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates. Effective December 31, 2021, the Company is no longer an emerging growth company.

## Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards UpdateNo. 2016-02 ("ASU 2016-02"), Leases ( Topic 842), as further amended ("ASC 842"), to increasetransparency and comparability among organizations by requiring the recognition of, at the lease commencement date, a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments, and a right-of-use ("ROU") asset for the right to use the underlying asset, on the balance sheet. Although the Company was an emerging growth company before December 31, 2021, it elected to early adopt ASC 842 on January 1, 2021. ASC 842 requires a modified retrospective transition method that could either be applied at the earliest comparative period in the financial statements or in the period of adoption. The Company elected to use the period of adoption (January 1, 2021) transition method and therefore did not recast prior periods. Results for reporting periods beginning on January 1, 2021 are presented under ASC 842, while prior period amounts continue to be reported and disclosed in accordance with the Company's historical accounting treatment under Accounting Standards Codification 840, Leases ("ASC 840"). In addition, the Company elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which allowed the Company: (1) to carry forward the historical lease classification; (2) not to reassess whether expired or existing contracts are or contain leases; and, (3) not to reassess the treatment of initial direct costs for existing leases. The Company made an accounting policy election under ASC 842 not to recognize the right of use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term of 12 months or

Table of Contents

less. The Company also elected to account for lease components and the associatednon-lease components in the contracts as a single lease component for most of the leased assets. Upon the adoption of this standard on January 1, 2021, the Company recognized an operating lease liability of $15,935, representing the present value of the minimum lease payments remaining as of the adoption date, and a right-of-use asset in the amount of $13,525. The right-of-use asset reflects adjustments forde-recognition of deferred lease liabilities and lease incentives. The Company's accounting for finance leases (previously classified as capital leases under ASC 840) remained substantially unchanged. See Note "17. Leases" for further disclosures.

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASUNo. 2019-12, Income Taxes-Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes . The standard intends to simplify and reduce the cost of accounting for income taxes. The new guidance removes certain exceptions for recognizing deferred taxes for foreign investments, the incremental approach to performing intraperiod allocation, and calculating income taxes in interim periods for year to date losses that exceed anticipated full year losses. The standard also adds guidance to reduce complexity in certain areas, including accounting for franchise taxes that are partially based on income, transactions with a government that result with a step up in the tax basis of goodwill, enacted changes in tax law during interim periods, and allocating taxes to members of a consolidated group which are not subject to tax. For public business entities, the amendments in ASU 2019-12 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted for all periods in which financial statements have not yet been issued, including interim periods. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2021 and noted no impact to the financial statements.

## Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In June 2016, the FASB issuedASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments ("ASU 2016-13"). Subsequent to the issuance of ASU 2016-13, the FASB has issued the following updates:ASU 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses , ASU 2019-04, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses, Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging , and Topic 825 , Financial Instruments , ASU 2019-05, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326)Targeted Transition Relief and ASU 2019-11, Codification Improvements to Topic 326 , Financial Instruments-Credit Losses . The objective of ASU 2016-13 and all the related updates is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. The amendments in this ASU replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. ASU 2016-13 and the related updates are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019 for public business entities excluding entities eligible to be smaller reporting companies and for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2022 for all other entities. Early adoption is permitted. As the Company was a smaller reporting company when the standard was issued, the Company could take advantage of the extended transition period and will adopt this standard and the related improvements on January 1, 2023 by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings for any impact. The Company is currently assessing the adoption of ASU 2016-13 and the related impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASUNo. 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects ofReference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting ("ASU 2020-04"). ASU 2020-04 provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the US GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burdens related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope ("ASU 2021-01"), to clarify certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting to apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. Both ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2021-01 are effective upon issuance

Table of Contents

through December 31, 2022. The Company's debt agreement that utilizes LIBOR has conventional LIBOR replacement language. Since the debt agreement has not discontinued the use of LIBOR, this ASU is not yet effective for the Company. To the extent the interest rate changes to the rate specified in the debt agreement , the Company will utilize the relief in this ASU. The Company evaluated the effects of adopting the provisions of ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2021-01 and does not expect a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

## 3. Acquisition

On September 17, 2020 (the "Acquisition Date"), the Company acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of CPN Biosciences, LLC ("CPN") pursuant to an asset purchase agreement dated July 24, 2020. CPN offered a physician office management solution and advanced wound care products.

The aggregate consideration amounted to $19,024 as of the Acquisition Date, consisting of $6,427 in cash, 2,151,438 shares of the Company's Class A common stock with a fair value of $8,815, and contingent consideration (the "Earnout") with a fair value of $3,782. On the Acquisition Date, the Company paid $5,820 in cash and issued 1,947,953 shares of the Company's Class A common stock. The remaining consideration of $1,436 was held back (the "Holdback") and will be paid or issued, as applicable, eighteen months after the Acquisition Date, subject to any offsetting indemnification claims against CPN.

The Company is obligated to pay the Earnout to CPN's former shareholders if CPN's legacy product revenue in the Earnout Period (July 1, 2021 to June 30, 2022), exceeds CPN's 2019 revenue. The amount of the Earnout, if any, will be equal to 70% of the excess and will be payable 60 days after the expiration of the Earnout Period. The Company recorded a non-current liability of $3,782 on the Acquisition Date for the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the expected Earnout. The Company assesses the fair value of the Earnout liability at each reporting period. As of December 31, 2021, the Earnout liability was estimated at $0 as a result of the Company's updated assessment of the near-term market for the CPN product portfolio. Subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the liability are reflected in earnings until the liability is settled. See Note "4. Fair Value Measurement of Financial Instruments".

## Earnout Liability

In connection with accounting for the CPN acquisition on September 17, 2020, the Company recorded an Earnout liability of $3,782 on the Acquisition Date, representing the fair value of contingent consideration payable upon the achievement of a certain revenue target. The Earnout liability is classified as a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy for which fair value is derived from inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. The fair value of such Earnout liability is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model that utilizes key assumptions including forecasted revenues and volatilities of the underlying financial metrics during the Earnout Period. The Company assesses the fair value of the Earnout liability at each reporting period. Any subsequent changes in the estimated fair value of the liability are reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses until the liability is settled. For more information about the Earnout liability, refer to Note "3. Acquisition". As of December 31, 2021, the Earnout liability decreased to $0 as a result of the Company's updated assessment of the near-term market for the CPN product portfolio.The following table provides a roll-forward of the fair value of the Company's Earnout liability, for which fair value is determined using Level 3 inputs:

## Warrant Liability

In connection with the Avista Merger, the Company issued4.1 million private warrants to Avista Capital Partners IV, L.P. and Avista Capital Partners IV (Offshore), L.P. on December 10, 2018 (the "Private Warrants"). The Company classified the warrants as a liability on the consolidated balance sheets as the settlement provisions of the Private Warrants failed the "fixed-for-fixed" rules under ASC815-40-15-7 . The warrant liability was initially recorded at fair value upon issuance in 2018 and was subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date. The Company utilized a Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the warrant liability. Estimates and assumptions impacting the fair value measurement included the estimated probability of adjusting the exercise price of the warrants, the remaining contractual term of the warrants, the risk-free interest rate, the expected dividend yield, and the expected volatility of the price of the underlying Class A common stock. Some of the significant inputs impacting the fair value of the warrant liability were not observable in the market and represented a Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy.

The Private Warrants were settled in the warrant exchange transactions in the third quarter of 2019, with a decrease of2,140 in the fair value recognized as a component of other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operation for the year ended 2019.

## 11. Restructuring

On October 21, 2020, the Company committed to a plan to restructure the workforce and consolidate its La Jolla facilities as part of theCompany's long-term plan to consolidate manufacturing operations into Massachusetts to reduce the Company's cost structure. The majority of the restructuring costs have been incurred as of December 31, 2021, with certain facility and storage costs continuing through the middle of2024. The restructuring will result in a charge of approximately $7.5 million, of which approximately $4.0 million is attributable to the retention benefits associated with approximately 65 employees and the remaining $3.5 million is related to the facility closures. As employees are required to provide future services, employee retention and other benefit-related costs related to the Company's restructuring are expensed over the service period.

As a result of this restructuring activity, the Company incurred a pre-tax charge of $4,704 and $618 in the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These charges were included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

## 2021 Credit Agreement

In August 2021, the Company, as borrower, its subsidiaries, as guarantors, and Silicon Valley Bank ("SVB"), and the several other lenders thereto (collectively, the "Lenders") entered into a credit agreement (the "2021 Credit Agreement"), providing for a term loan facility not to exceed $75,000 (the "Term Loan Facility") and a revolving credit facility not to exceed $125,000 (the "Revolving Facility"). The Company's obligations to the Lenders are secured by substantially all of the Company's assets, including intellectual property. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined are defined as set forth in the 2021 Credit Agreement.

## Table of Contents

The Company may prepay the Term Loan Facility, provided that any Term Loans prepaid prior to August 6, 2022 must be accompanied by a prepayment premium equal to 1.00% of the aggregate amount of Term Loans prepaid. Once repaid, amounts borrowed under the Term Loan Facility may not be re-borrowed.

The Company must pay in arrears, on the first day of each quarter prior to August 6, 2026 (the "Revolving Termination Date") and on the Revolving Termination Date, a fee for the Company's non-use of available funds in an amount equal to the Commitment Fee Rate per annum, multiplied by the difference between (x) the Total Revolving Commitments and (y) the sum of (i) the average for the period of the daily closing balance of the Revolving Loans, excluding the aggregate principal amount of Swingline Loans, (ii) the aggregate undrawn amount of all Letters of Credit outstanding at such time and (iii) the aggregate amount of all L/C Disbursements that have not yet been reimbursed or converted into Revolving Loans or Swingline Loans. The Commitment Fee Rate is between 0.25% to 0.45% based on the Total Net Leverage Ratio. The maturity date for advances made under the Revolving Facility is the Revolving Termination Date. The Company may elect to reduce or terminate the Revolving Facility in its entirety at any time by repaying all outstanding principal, unpaid accrued interest and, with respect to any such reduction or termination of the Revolving Commitments made prior to August 6, 2022, 1.00% of the aggregate amount of the Revolving Commitments so reduced or terminated.

Under the 2021 Credit Agreement, the Company is required to comply with certain financial covenants including the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio and Consolidated Total Net Leverage Ratio, tested quarterly. In addition, the Company is also required to make representations and warranties and comply with certain non-financial covenants that are customary in loan agreements of this type, including restrictions on the payment of dividends, repurchase of stock, incurrence of indebtedness, dispositions and acquisitions.

As of December 31, 2021, the Company had outstanding borrowings of $74,062 under the Term Loan Facility and $0 under the Revolving Facility with $125,000 available for future revolving borrowings. The Company recorded additional debt issuance costs and related fees of $604 in connection with the Term Loan Facility, which are recorded as a reduction of the carrying value of the term loan on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. In connection with the Revolving Facility, the Company recorded debt issuance costs and related fees of $1,223, which are recorded as other assets. Both of these costs are being amortized to interest expense through the maturity date of the facilities.

## 2019 Credit Agreement

In March 2019, the Company, its subsidiaries and SVB, and the several other lenders thereto entered into a credit agreement, as amended (the "2019 Credit Agreement"), providing for a term loan facility of $40,000 and a revolving credit facility of up to $60,000. Both facilities were set to mature in2024. The interest rate for the term loan facility was a floating per annum interest rate equal to the greater of3.75% above the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate and 9.25%. The interest rate for advances under the revolving facility was a floating per annum interest rate equal to the greater of the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate and 5.50%. If the Company elected to prepay the loan or terminate the facilities, the Company was required to pay a certain percentage of the outstanding principal as a prepayment fee. A final payment fee (the "Final Payment") of 6.5% multiplied by the original aggregate principal amount of term loan facility was due upon the earlier to occur of the maturity date of the term loan or prepayment of all outstanding principal.

In August 2021, upon entering into the 2021 Credit Agreement, the Company paid an aggregate amount of $70,559 due under the 2019 Credit Agreement, including unpaid principal, accrued interest, the Final Payment and a prepayment fee, with proceeds from the 2021 Credit Agreement, and the 2019 Credit Agreement was terminated. Upon termination of the 2019 Credit Agreement, the Company recognized $1,883 as loss on the extinguishment of the loan for the year ended December 31, 2021.

## Warrant Exchange and Warrant Exercise

As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 4.3 million private warrants outstanding, 4.1 million of which were issued to Avista Capital Partners IV, L.P. and Avista Capital Partners IV (Offshore), L.P. in connection with the Avista Merger on December 10, 2018 (the "Private Warrants"), and 31.0 million public warrants outstanding that were issued in connection with the initial public offering of Avista Healthcare Public Acquisition Corp. on October 10, 2016 (the "Public Warrants", together with the Private Warrants, the "Warrants").

In the third quarter of 2019, the Company executed a series of transactions related to its then outstanding30,890,748 Public Warrants and 4,100,000 Private Warrants. The Company issued an aggregate of 2,845,280 shares of Class A common stock for29,950,150 Public Warrants at an exchange rate of 0.095. The Company issued an aggregate of80,451 shares of Class A common stock for the remaining Public Warrants at an exchange rate of0.0855. The Company issued an aggregate of 389,501 shares of Class A common stock for the Private Warrants at an exchange rate of0.095.

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

As the fair value of the Warrants exchanged in the warrant exchange transactions immediately prior to the exchanges was less than the fair value of the Class A common stock issued, the Company recorded a non-cash deemed dividend of $568 for the incremental fair value provided to the Warrant holders in the year ended December 31, 2019.

The Company originally classified the Warrants as equity on its financial statements. As a result of the issuance of the SEC Statement in 2021, the Company reevaluated the historical accounting treatment of its Public Warrants and Private Warrants and determined that the Private Warrants should have been recorded at fair value as a liability in the Company's consolidated balance sheet with changes to the fair value recorded to the consolidated statements of operations. See Note "2. Significant Accounting Policies" for detail.

## 14. Share-Based Compensation

## Stock Incentive Plans-the 2018 Plan

On November 28, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Company adopted, and on December 10, 2018, the Company's stockholders approved, the Organogenesis 2018 Equity and Incentive Plan (the "2018 Plan"). The purposes of the 2018 Plan are to provide long-term incentives and rewards to the Company's employees, officers, directors and other key persons (including consultants), to attract and retain persons with the requisite experience and ability, and to more closely align the interests of such employees, officers, directors and other key persons with the interests of the Company's stockholders.

The 2018 Plan authorizes the Company's Board of Directors or a committee of not less than two independent directors (in either case, the "Administrator") to grant the following types of awards: non-statutory stock options; incentive stock options; restricted stock awards; restricted stock units; stock appreciation rights; unrestricted stock awards; performance share awards; and dividend equivalent rights. The 2018 Plan is administered by the Company's Board of Directors.

As of December 31, 2021, a total of9,198,996 shares of Class A common stock have been authorized to be issued under the 2018 Plan (subject to adjustment in the case of any stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or similar change in capitalization of the Company).

## Stock Incentive Plans-the 2003 Plan

The Organogenesis 2003 Stock Incentive Plan (the "2003 Plan"), provides for the Company to issue restricted stock awards, or to grant incentive stock options or non-statutory stock options. Incentive stock options may be granted only to the Company's employees. Restricted stock awards andnon-statutory stock options may be granted to employees, members of the Board of Directors, outside advisors and consultants of the Company.

Effective as of the closing of the Avista Merger on December 10, 2018, no additional awards may be made under the 2003 Plan and as a result (i) any shares in respect of stock options that are expired or terminated under the 2003 Plan without having been fully exercised will not be available for future awards; (ii) any shares in respect of restricted stock that are forfeited to, or otherwise repurchased by the Company, will not be available for future awards; and (iii) any shares of Class A common stock that are tendered to the Company by a participant to exercise an award will not be available for future awards.

## Stock-Based Compensation Expense

Stock options awarded under the stock incentive plans expire10 years after the grant date and typically vest over four or five years. Restricted stock units awarded typically vest over four years.

During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $3,864, $1,661, and $936, respectively, within selling, general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.

## Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)

During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company granted310,692 time-based restricted stock units to its employees, executives and the Board of Directors. Each restricted stock unit represents the contingent right to receive one share of the Company's Class A common stock. The fair value of the restricted stock units was based on the fair market value of the Company's stock on the date of grant.

The activity of restricted stock units is set forth below:

As of December 31, 2021, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock units expected to vest was $ 3,273 and the weighted average remaining recognition period for unvested awards was 2.72 years.

## Stock Options

The stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020 were1,069,658 and 1,553,723, respectively. The assumptions that the Company used to determine the grant-date fair value of stock options granted during these periods were as follows, presented on a weighted-average basis:

|                          | Year Ended December 31, 2020   | Year Ended December 31, 2020   |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
|                          | 2021                           |                                |
| Risk-free interest rate  | 0.83 %                         | 0.46 %                         |
| Expected term (in years) | 6.22                           | 6.22                           |
| Expected volatility      | 39.31 %                        | 37.42 %                        |
| Expected dividend yield  | 0.0%                           | 0.0%                           |
| Exercise price           | $ 13.57                        | $ 4.04                         |
| Underlying stock price   | $13.57                         | $ 3.37                         |

These assumptions resulted in an estimated weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 of $5.32 and $1.05, respectively.

The following table summarizes the Company's stock option activity since December 31, 2020:

| Options vested or expected to vest as of December 31, 2021 | 6,216,308          | $ 3.79                            | 4.98                                                     | 37,618                      |

The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the stock options and the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock for those stock options that have exercise prices lower than the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock.

The total fair value of options vested during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $813 and $678, respectively.

As of December 31, 2021, the total unrecognized stock compensation expense was $3,998 and was expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.92 years.

Between 2010 and 2013, a former executive took several partial recourse notes totaling $635 to exercise his 675,990 shares of stock options. The notes were secured with these shares held by the former executive. When the loans were outstanding, the options were not considered exercised and were included within the options outstanding for accounting purposes. As of December 31, 2020, $334 of the principal balance of the partial recourse notes was outstanding and 195,278 shares were not considered outstanding for accounting purposes. In the three months ended March 31, 2021, the former executive repaid the remaining principal balance of the notes (see Note "19. Related Parties Transactions"). The repayments were treated as the exercise price for the 195,278 shares of the options and were included in the consolidated statement of stockholders' equity. As of December 31, 2021, the partial recourse notes were paid off and all of the 675,990 shares used to secure the notes were considered outstanding for ac counting purposes.

## 15. Income Taxes

The components of the income tax expense (benefit) consisted of the following for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:

On a periodic basis, the Company reassess the valuation allowance on its deferred income tax assets, weighing positive and negative evidence to assess the recoverability of the deferred tax assets. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company assessed the valuation allowance and considered positive evidence, including significant cumulative consolidated income over the three years ended December 31, 2021, revenue growth and expectations of future profitability, and negative evidence, including the impact of a negative change in the economic climate, significant risks and uncertainties in the business and restrictions on tax loss utilization in certain state jurisdictions. After assessing both the positive evidence and the negative evidence, the Company determined it was more likely than not that its deferred tax assets would be realized in the future and released the valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2021, resulting in a benefit from income taxes of $48,252.

As of December 31, 2021, the Company had available for the reduction of future years' federal taxable income, net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $103,619.

The Company's subsidiary in Switzerland is carrying a deferred tax asset of approximately $16 relating to a net operating loss carryover that is expected to be benefited in the next couple of years.

The Company has not recorded withholding taxes on the undistributed earnings of its Swiss subsidiary because it is the Company's intent to reinvest such earnings indefinitely.

Ownership changes, as defined in the Internal Revenue Code, may limit the amount of net operating losses and research and development tax credit carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income. Subsequent ownership changes could further affect the limitation in future years. The Company completed an analysis in 2021 and determined that it had not experienced an ownership change during the periods 2001 through 2021.

The differences between income taxes expected at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of21% and the reported consolidated income tax benefit (expense) are summarized as follows:

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if itis more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.The amount of unrecognized tax benefits is $2,307, $2,870, and $3,192 as of December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The net decrease primarily relates to the expiration of the carryforward period for certain Federal and Massachusetts R&D credits previously included as an unrecognized tax benefit.

A tabular roll forward of the Company's uncertainties in its income tax provision liability is presented below:

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal and state jurisdictions and Switzerland. With limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to federal, state, local or foreign examinations for years prior to December 31, 2017. However, carryforward attributes that were generated prior to December 31, 2017 may still be adjusted upon examination by state or local tax authorities if they either have been or will be used in a future period.

The Company recognizes interest and penalty-related expenses in tax expenses. There was $330 and $317 of interest recorded for uncertain tax positions for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which was classified in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets. These amounts are not reflected in the reconciliation above.

## 16. Net Income (Loss) Per Share (EPS)

Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect, if any, of outstanding equity awards using the treasury stock method which includes consideration of unrecognized compensation expenses as additional proceeds.

A reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the calculation of the basic and diluted net income (loss) attributable to the Class A common stockholders is as follows:

For the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, outstanding stock-based awards of 994,168 and 1,792,085 were excluded from the diluted EPS calculation as they are anti-dilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company had a net loss. As such, 7,179,636 shares of potentially dilutive securities have been excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share as these securities have anti-dilutive effects and including them would reduce the net loss per share. Therefore, the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding used to calculate both basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to Class A common stockholders was the same for this period.

## 17. Leases

As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company's contracts that contained a lease consisted primarily of real estate, equipment and vehicle leases.

The Company leases real estate for office, lab, warehouse and production space under noncancelable operating and finance leases that expire at various dates through 2035, subject to the Company's options to terminate or renew certain leases for an additional five to ten years.

The Company leases vehicles under operating leases for certain employees and has fleet services agreements for service on these vehicles. The minimum lease term for each newly leased vehicle is 367 days with renewal options. The Company may terminate the vehicle lease after the minimum lease term upon thirty days' prior notice.

The Company also leases other equipment under noncancelable operating and finance leases that expire at various dates through 2025.

The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at lease inception. The options to extend or terminate a lease are included in the lease terms when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the options. Operating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease obligations on the consolidated balance sheets. Finance lease right-of-use assets are included in property and equipment, net, and the related liabilities are included in finance lease obligations on the consolidated balance sheets.

Right-of-use assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the leases. Right-of-use assets

## Table of Contents

and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the fixed lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. The right-of-use assets also include any initial direct costs incurred and lease payments made at or before the commencement date and are reduced by lease incentives. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate to determine the present value of the lease payments for leases that do not have a readily determinable implicit discount rate. The Company's incremental borrowing rate is the rate of interest that it would have to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term and amount in a similar economic environment. The Company determines the incremental borrowing rates for its leases by adjusting the risk-free interest rate with a credit risk premium corresponding to the Company's credit rating.

The Company records rent expense for its operating leases on a straight-line basis from the lease commencement date until the end of the lease term. The Company records finance lease cost as a combination of the depreciation expense for the right-of-use assets and interest expense for the outstanding lease liabilities using the discount rate discussed above. Variable lease payments are primarily related to the office and fleet leases which include but are not limited to taxes, insurance, common area maintenance and maintenance programs for leased vehicles. Variable lease payments are based on the occurrence or usage; therefore, they are not included as part of the initial right-of-use assets and liabilities calculation.

In March 2019, the Company entered into an agreement to lease approximately43,850 square feet of office and laboratory space in Norwood, Massachusetts. The rent commencement date was February 1, 2020. The initial lease term was ten years from the rent commencement date and included an option for an early extension term of five years which was exercisable during the first two years after the rent commencement date. The Company exercised the option to extend the lease for additional five years in December 2021. In addition to the early extension term, the lease provides the Company with an option to extend the lease term for a period of ten years, if exercised, at rental rates equal to the then fair market value. Annual lease payments during the first year were $1,052 with increases of $44 each year during the initial ten-year lease term, an increase of $44 during the first year of the early extension term and $33 during year two through five of the early extension term. Upon execution of the agreement, the Company delivered a security deposit in the form of a letter of credit of $526 to the landlord. Following 36 months from the rent commencement date, the security deposit may be reduced by $ 263.

In August 2020, the Company entered into a lease for approximately23,000 square feet in San Diego, California for office and laboratory use. The lease commenced on April 1, 2021. The initial lease term is ten years from the lease commencement date, with an option to extend the term for a period of five years. Annual lease payments during the first year were $1,562 with a 3% increase each year during the lease term. A security deposit of $237 is required throughout the term of the lease.

On January 1, 2013, the Company entered into finance lease arrangements with 65 Dan Road SPE, LLC, 85 Dan Road Associates, LLC, Dan Road Equity I, LLC and 275 Dan Road SPE, LLC for office and laboratory space in Canton, Massachusetts. 65 Dan Road SPE, LLC, 85 Dan Road Associates, LLC, Dan Road Equity I, LLC and 275 Dan Road SPE, LLC are related parties as the owners of these entities are also stockholders of the Company. Other than the lease with 275 Dan Road SPE, LLC which was terminated in August 2021 as discussed below, the remaining three leases were set to terminate on December 31, 2022 and each contained a renewal option for a five-year period with the rental rate at the greater of (i) rent for the last year of the prior term, or (ii) the then fair market value. The Company exercised the option to extend the leases for additional five years in November 2021. These leases were reclassified from finance leases to operating leases upon the Company's reassessment of the lease classification according to ASC 842-10-25-1 Lease Classification. The related finance lease assets and liabilities were reclassified to operatinglease right-of-use assets and operating lease obligations on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021.

As of December 31, 2020, the Company owed an aggregate of $10,336 of accrued but unpaid lease obligations under the aforementioned leases. Effective April 1, 2019, the Company agreed to accrue interest on the accrued but unpaid lease obligations at an interest rate equal to the rate charged in the 2019 Credit Agreement. These accrued but unpaid lease obligations as well as the accrued interest on these obligations were

subordinated to the 2019 Credit Agreement. With the termination of the 2019 Credit Agreement and the execution of the 2021 Credit Agreement (see Note "12. Long-Term Debt Obligations") in August 2021, these obligations are no longer subordinated to the Company's existing loans.

In August 2021, the Company purchased the building (the "275 Dan Road Building") under the lease with 275 Dan Road SPE, LLC for $6,013 and the lease was terminated. The Company recorded an asset of $4,943 to buildings within fixed asset, net in accordance with ASC842-20-40-2 Purchase of the Underlying Asset to account for the purchase of the leased asset. The asset value includes $408 net book value of the right of use asset removed from leasehold improvement and the difference of $4,535 between the cash paid and the lease liability extinguished. In connection with the purchase of the 275 Dan Road Building, the Company paid 50% of the accrued but unpaid lease obligations associated with this building and the accrued interest thereof. The remaining balance is to be paid in five installments on January 4, 2022, April 1, 2022, July 1, 2022, October 3, 2022 and January 3, 2023. The interest on the balance of the accrued but unpaid lease obligations associated with the 275 Dan Road Building was reduced to an annual simple rate of 4.5%.

The accrued but unpaid lease obligations as well as the related interest accruals are shown below. The decrease of the interest portion of rent in arrears was due to the payment made by the Company in connection with the purchase of the 275 Dan Road Building as mentioned in the previous paragraph.

Under this agreement, the Company incurred a royalty based on a percentage of net product sales, for the use of these patents until the patents expired, which was in November 2006. Accrued royalties totaled $1,187 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are classified as part of accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. There was no royalty expense incurred during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 related to this agreement.

In October 2017, the Company entered into a license agreement with a third party. Under the license agreement, the Company is required to pay royalties based on a percentage of net sales of the licensed product that occur, after December 31, 2017, through the expiration of the underlying patent in October 2026, subject to minimum royalty payment provisions. The Company recorded royalty expense of $5,929, $4,370, and $3,778 during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, within selling, general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.

As part of the NuTech Medical acquisition, the Company inherited certain product development and consulting agreements for ongoing consulting services and royalty payments based on a percentage of net sales on certain products over a period of 15 years from the execution of the agreements.

## Legal Matters

In conducting its activities, the Company, from time to time, is subject to various claims and also has claims against others. In management's opinion, the ultimate resolution of such claims would not have a material effect on the financial position, operating results or cash flows of the Company. The Company accrues for these claims when amounts due are probable and estimable. The Company accrued $150 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 in relation to certain pending lawsuits.

The purchase price for NuTech Medical acquired in 2017 included $7,500 deferred acquisition consideration of which the Company paid $2,500 in 2017. The remaining $5,000 of deferred acquisition

In connection with the settlement of the deferred acquisition consideration dispute and the legacy lawsuit, the Company recorded a gain of $2,246 for the year ended December 31, 2020.
