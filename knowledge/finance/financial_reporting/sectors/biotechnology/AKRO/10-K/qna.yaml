      From 2020 to 2023, Akero made significant progress in clinical
      development of EFX (efruxifermin), its lead product candidate for NASH
      treatment. The company advanced from Phase 2a BALANCED study through Phase
      2b HARMONY and SYMMETRY trials, demonstrating strong efficacy in fibrosis
      improvement and NASH resolution. Key milestones included achieving
      statistically significant results in the HARMONY study, with 41% of
      patients in the 50mg group showing fibrosis improvement without worsening
      of NASH, and 76% achieving NASH resolution. The company also received Fast
      Track, Breakthrough Therapy (FDA), and PRIME (EMA) designations for EFX.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: How did Akero's clinical development program for EFX evolve from 2020
          to 2023?
        answer: >
          Akero progressed from the Phase 2a BALANCED study in 2020 to two
          parallel Phase 2b trials: HARMONY (pre-cirrhotic NASH) and SYMMETRY
          (cirrhotic NASH). The HARMONY study demonstrated significant efficacy
          with 41% of patients in the 50mg group achieving fibrosis improvement
          and 76% achieving NASH resolution after 24 weeks. The company expanded
          its clinical program to include Cohort D in the SYMMETRY study,
          evaluating EFX in combination with GLP-1 therapeutics in patients with
          both NASH and Type 2 diabetes.
      - question: What were the key efficacy results demonstrated across Akero's
          clinical trials from 2020-2023?
        answer: >
          The clinical trials showed consistent efficacy across multiple
          endpoints. In the HARMONY study, both 50mg and 28mg dose groups
          achieved statistical significance, with the 50mg group showing 41%
          fibrosis improvement and 76% NASH resolution rates. Earlier trials
          demonstrated significant reductions in liver fat (63-71%),
          improvements in glycemic control (HbA1c reductions up to 0.9%), and
          significant improvements in cardiovascular markers including
          triglycerides (up to 45% reduction).
      - question: How did regulatory support for EFX development evolve during this
          period?
        answer: >
          Akero secured multiple key regulatory designations: FDA Fast Track
          designation, FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation, and EMA PRIME
          designation for EFX in NASH treatment. These designations acknowledged
          EFX's potential to address high unmet medical need and provided
          enhanced regulatory support, more frequent interactions, and potential
          for accelerated assessment of marketing authorization applications.
