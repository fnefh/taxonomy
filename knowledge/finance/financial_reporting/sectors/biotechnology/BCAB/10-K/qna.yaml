      - question: How did BioAtla's clinical pipeline evolve during this period?
        answer: >
          The pipeline showed significant advancement: 1) Mecbotamab vedotin
          (BA3011) progressed to potentially registration-enabling Phase 2
          trials in sarcoma and NSCLC, receiving Orphan Drug Designation for
          soft tissue sarcoma 2) Ozuriftamab vedotin (BA3021) advanced to Phase
          2 trials in melanoma and SCCHN after showing promising Phase 1 results
          3) Evalstotug (BA3071) initiated Phase 1/2 trials as monotherapy and
          in combination with anti-PD-1 antibody 4) BA3182 (CAB-EpCAM x CAB-CD3)
          entered Phase 1 trials in advanced adenocarcinoma
      - question: What were the key regulatory and clinical milestones achieved?
        answer: >
          Major milestones included: 1) FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to
          mecbotamab vedotin for soft tissue sarcoma treatment 2) FDA clearance
          to initiate potentially registration-enabling Phase 2/3 trial for
          mecbotamab vedotin in NSCLC 3) Successful completion of Phase 1 trials
          showing promising safety and efficacy profiles 4) Initiation of
          multiple Phase 2 trials across the pipeline with both monotherapy and
          combination approaches
      - question: How did the clinical development strategy evolve?
        answer: >
          Strategic evolution included: 1) Focus on combination approaches,
          particularly with PD-1 inhibitors like nivolumab 2) Implementation of
          biomarker-driven patient selection strategies 3) Expansion into
          multiple indications including sarcoma, NSCLC, melanoma, and SCCHN 4)
          Development of both monotherapy and combination therapy approaches to
          maximize therapeutic potential
