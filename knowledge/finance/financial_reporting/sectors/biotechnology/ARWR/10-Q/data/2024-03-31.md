NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
--------------------------------------------------------

General and Recent Developments
-------------------------------

Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries (referred to herein collectively as the "Company") are primarily engaged in developing medicines that treat intractable diseases by silencing the genes that cause them. Using a broad portfolio of RNA chemistries and efficient modes of delivery, the Company's therapies trigger the RNA interference mechanism to induce rapid, deep and durable knockdown of target genes. RNA interference ("RNAi") is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene, thereby affecting the production of a specific protein. The Company's RNAi-based therapeutics may leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing to target and shut down specific disease-causing genes.

The following table presents the Company's current pipeline:

| Therapeutic Area | Name | Stage | Product Rights |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cardiometabolic | plozasiran (ARO-APOC3) | Phase 3 | Arrowhead |
|  | zodasiran (ARO-ANG3) | Phase 2b | Arrowhead |
|  | olpasiran | Phase 3 | Amgen |
| Pulmonary | ARO-RAGE | Phase 1/2a | Arrowhead |
|  | ARO-MUC5AC | Phase 1/2a | Arrowhead |
|  | ARO-MMP7 | Phase 1/2a | Arrowhead |
| Liver | GSK-4532990 | Phase 2b | GSK |
|  | fazirsiran | Phase 3 | Takeda and Arrowhead |
|  | JNJ-3989 | Phase 2 | GSK |
|  | ARO-C3 | Phase 1/2a | Arrowhead |
|  | ARO-PNPLA3 | Phase 1 | Arrowhead |
|  | ARO-CFB | Phase 1/2a | Arrowhead |
| Muscle | ARO-DUX4 | Phase 1/2a | Arrowhead |
|  | ARO-DM1 | Phase 1/2a | Arrowhead |
| Central Nervous System (CNS) | Various | Pre-Clinical | Arrowhead |

The Company operates lab facilities in California and Wisconsin, where its research and development activities, including the development of RNAi therapeutics, take place. The Company's principal executive offices are located in Pasadena, California.

Thus far in fiscal 2024, the Company has continued to develop and advance its pipeline and partnered candidates. Several key recent developments include:

* · Completed enrollment in Amgen's Phase 3 OCEAN(a) - outcome trial of olpasiran, triggering a $50.0 million milestone payment to the Company, which was paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2024;
* · Presented final data from the double-blind treatment period of the Company's Phase 2 SHASTA-2 study of investigational plozasiran in patients with severe Hypertriglyceridemia. Results from the SHASTA-2 study showed dramatic, consistent, and sustained reductions in Apolipoprotein C-III (APOC3) and triglycerides and improvement in multiple atherogenic lipoprotein levels;
* · Announced an Expanded Access Program (EAP) to make investigational plozasiran available outside of a clinical trial for qualifying patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS);
* · Initiated a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of ARO-DM1, being developed as a potential treatment for type 1 myotonic dystrophy (DM1), the most common adult-onset muscular dystrophy;
* · Filed an application for clearance to initiate a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of ARO-CFB, being developed as a potential treatment for complement mediated renal disease;
* · Entered into an Amended and Restated License Agreement with GSK, pursuant to which GSK received a worldwide, exclusive license to develop and commercialize JNJ-3989 (formerly ARO-HBV). JNJ-3989 had previously been licensed to Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. See Note 2.

Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
---------------------------------------

The interim Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries (wholly-owned subsidiaries and a variable interest entity for which the Company is the primary beneficiary). Subsidiaries refer to Arrowhead Madison, Inc., Visirna Therapeutics, Inc. ("Visirna"), and Arrowhead Australia Pty Ltd. For subsidiaries in which the Company owns or is exposed to less than 100% of the economics, the Company records net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in its consolidated statements of operations equal to the percentage of the economic or ownership interests retained in such entity by the respective noncontrolling party.

The interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The financial data of the Company included herein are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all material adjustments of a normal recurring nature have been made to present fairly the Company's financial position at March 31, 2024 and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

Certain financial information that is normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, but that is not required for interim reporting purposes, has been omitted from the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements and related notes. Readers are urged to review the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023 for more complete descriptions and discussions. Operating results and cash flows for the six months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024.

Liquidity
---------

The Company's primary sources of financing have been through the sale of its equity securities, revenue from its licensing and collaboration agreements and the sale of certain future royalties. Research and development activities have required significant capital investment since the Company's inception and are expected to continue to require significant cash expenditure in the future, particularly as the Company's pipeline of drug candidates and its headcount have both expanded. Additionally, significant capital investment will be required as the Company's pipeline matures into later stage clinical trials.

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had $127.7 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash ($2.2 million in restricted cash) and $395.4 million in availablefor-sale securities to fund operations. During the six months ended March 31, 2024, the Company's cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and investments balance increased by $119.5 million which was primarily due to the net proceeds of $429.3 million from the underwritten offering in January 2024 discussed below, offset by ongoing expenses related to the Company's research and development programs, general and administrative expenses and capital expenditures.

On January 2, 2024, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with Jefferies LLC, BofA Securities, Inc., and Cowen and Company, LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters. The Company issued 15,790,000 shares of common stock at a price of $28.50 per share. The aggregate purchase price paid by investors was $450.0 million and the Company received net proceeds of $429.3 million after deducting advisory fees and offering expenses.

In total, the Company is eligible to receive up to $2.8 billion in developmental, regulatory and sales milestones, and may receive various royalties on net sales from its licensing and collaboration agreements, subject to the terms and conditions of those agreements. The revenue recognition for these collaboration agreements is discussed further in Note 2.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
------------------------------------------

There have been no changes to the significant accounting policies disclosed in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.

Uncertainty in Income Taxes
---------------------------

The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $3.3 million and $0 for the six months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The income tax benefit is primarily due to the discrete change in the Company's uncertain tax positions related to the statute of limitation expiration.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
--------------------------------

In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , to improve its income tax disclosure requirements. Under the ASU, entities must annually (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. This ASU will become effective for the Company beginning on October 1, 2025. The Company does not expect any material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures resulting from applying this ASU.

Due to the specialized and unique nature of these Takeda R&D Services and their direct relationship with the license, the Company determined that these deliverables represent one distinct bundle and, thus, one performance obligation. Beyond the Takeda R&D Services, which are the responsibility of the Company, Takeda will be responsible for managing future clinical development and commercialization outside the United States. Within the United States, the Company will also participate in co-development and cocommercialization efforts and will co-fund these efforts with Takeda as part of the 50/50 profit sharing structure within the United States. The Company considers the collaborative activities, including the co-development and co-commercialization, to be a separate unit of account within Topic 808, and as such, these co-funding amounts are recorded as research and development expenses or general and administrative expenses, as appropriate.

Under the terms of the Takeda License Agreement, the Company received $300.0 million as an upfront payment in January 2021 and an additional $40.0 million upon Takeda's initiation of a Phase 3 REDWOOD clinical study of fazirsiran in March 2023, and is eligible to receive up to $ 527.5 million in additional potential development, regulatory and commercial milestones.

The Company has allocated the total $300.0 million initial transaction price to itsone distinct performance obligation for the fazirsiran license and the associated Takeda R&D Services. Revenue was recognized using the input method (based on actual patient visits completed versus total estimated visits completed for the ongoing SEQUOIA and AROAAT2002 clinical studies). The Phase 2 study visits for patients in the SEQUOIA and AROAAT2002 studies concluded by December 31, 2023, and the Company has substantially completed its performance obligation under the Takeda license agreement. As such, all revenue has been fully recognized as of December 31, 2023. There were no further deferred revenue and contract liabilities as of March 31, 2024 .

The Company has recorded $13.8 million as accrued expenses as of March 31, 2024 that was primarily driven by co-development and co-commercialization activities.

Stock Option Awards
-------------------

The following table presents a summary of the stock option activity for the six months ended March 31, 2024:

|  | Shares | Weighted- Average Exercise Price Per Share | Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Term (Years) | Aggregate Intrinsic Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Outstanding at September 30, 2023 | 2,263,477 | $ 22.68 |  |  |
| Granted | - | - |  |  |
| Cancelled or expired | (30,437) | 61.11 |  |  |
| Exercised | (154,347) | 11.53 |  |  |
| Outstanding at March 31, 2024 | 2,078,693 | $ 23.04 | 4.0 years | $ 26,788,979 |
| Exercisable at March 31, 2024 | 2,054,866 | $ 22.72 | 3.9 years | $ 26,788,746 |

The aggregate intrinsic values represent the amount by which the market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised during the three months ended March 31, 2024

and 2023 was $2.5 million and $1.4 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised during the six months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 was $3.1 million and $3.6 million, respectively

Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options outstanding for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, was $0.6 million and $2.2 million, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options outstanding for the six months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, was $2.1 million and $4.6 million, respectively.

As of March 31, 2024, the pre-tax compensation expense for all outstanding unvested stock options in the amount of $0.8 million will be recognized in the Company's results of operations over a weighted average period of 4 months.

The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which do not have vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. The determination of the fair value of each stock option is affected by the Company's stock price on the date of grant, as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. Because the Company's employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options. No options were granted during the six months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.

Visirna ESOP : On October 1, 2023, Visirna, a subsidiary of the Company, granted 7,500,000 stock options to its employees from the Employee Stock Option Plan (the "Visirna ESOP"), which authorizes 20,000,000 shares for issuance. The Visirna ESOP is independently managed by Visirna, including the valuation process. For the three and six months ended March 31, 2024, stock-based compensation expense related to the Visirna ESOP was $1.2 million and $3.2 million, respectively.

Restricted Stock Units
----------------------

Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs"), including market-based, time-based and performance-based awards, have been granted under the Company's 2013 and 2021 Plans and as inducements grants granted outside of the Company's equity-based compensation plans. At vesting, each outstanding RSU will be exchanged for one share of the Company's common stock. RSU awards generally vest subject to the satisfaction of service requirements or the satisfaction of both service requirements and achievement of certain performance targets.

The following table summarizes the activity of the Company's RSUs:

|  | Number of RSUs | Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Outstanding at September 30, 2023 | 4,241,640 | $ 58.43 |
| Granted | 1,838,025 | 30.75 |
| Vested | (876,352) | 53.60 |
| Forfeited | (112,150) | 44.16 |
| Outstanding at March 31, 2024 | 5,091,163 | $ 49.58 |

The fair value of RSUs was determined based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the grant date, with consideration given to the probability of achieving service and/or performance conditions for awards.

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded $16.0 million and $18.4 million of expense related to RSUs, respectively. For the six months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded $32.2 million and $35.4 million of expense related to RSUs, respectively. As of March 31, 2024, there was $112.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of1.7 years.

NOTE 10. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
--------------------------------

The Company employs a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The Company's valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value and the definition of the three levels (Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3) of the fair value hierarchy are disclosed in Note 10 - Fair Value Measurements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Part IV, "Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules" of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023.

The Company uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including during periods of market disruption. In periods of market disruption, the ability to observe prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2, or from Level 2 to Level 3. The Company recognizes transfers between levels at either the actual date of the event or a change in circumstances that caused the transfer. At March 31, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company did not have any financial assets or financial liabilities based on Level 3 measurements.

The following table presents information about the Company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company:

|  | March 31, 2024 | March 31, 2024 | March 31, 2024 | March 31, 2024 |

NOTE 11. LIABILITY RELATED TO THE SALE OF FUTURE ROYALTIES
----------------------------------------------------------

In November 2022, the Company and Royalty Pharma entered into the Royalty Pharma Agreement, pursuant to which Royalty Pharma agreed to pay up to $410.0 million in cash to the Company in consideration for the Company's future royalty interest in olpasiran, a small interfering RNA (siRNA) originally developed by the Company and licensed to Amgen in September 2016 under the Olpasiran Agreement.

Pursuant to the Royalty Pharma Agreement, Royalty Pharma paid $250.0 million upfront and agreed to pay up to an additional $160.0 million in aggregate one-time milestone payments due if and when the following milestone events occur: (i) $50.0 million on completion of enrollment in the OCEAN Phase 3 clinical trial for olpasiran, (ii) $50.0 million upon receipt of FDA approval of olpasiran for an approved indication (reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction, urgent coronary revascularization, or coronary heart disease death in adults with established cardiovascular disease and elevated Lp(a)), and (iii) $60.0 million upon Royalty Pharma's receipt of at least $70.0 million of royalty payments under the Royalty Pharma Agreement in any single calendar year.

In consideration for the payment of the foregoing amounts under the Royalty Pharma Agreement, Royalty Pharma is entitled to receive all royalties otherwise payable by Amgen to the Company under the Olpasiran Agreement. The Company remains eligible to receive any milestone payments potentially payable by Amgen under the Olpasiran Agreement.

The Company has evaluated the terms of the Royalty Pharma Agreement and concluded in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance that the Company accounted for the transaction as debt and the funding of $250.0 million from Royalty Pharma was recorded as a liability related to the sale of future royalties on its consolidated balance sheets. The Company is not obligated to repay this upfront funding received under the Royalty Pharma Agreement.

The Company records the obligations at their carrying value using the effective interest method. In order to amortize the sale of future royalties, the Company utilizes the prospective method to estimate the future royalties to be paid by the Company to the counterparty over the life of the arrangement. Under the prospective method, a new effective interest rate is determined based on the revised estimate of remaining cash flows. The new rate is the discount rate that equates the present value of the revised estimate of remaining cash flows with the carrying amount of the debt, and it will be used to recognize non-cash interest expense for the remaining periods. The Company periodically assesses the amount and the timing of expected royalty payments using a combination of internal projections and forecasts from external sources. The estimates of future net product sales (and resulting royalty payments) are based on key assumptions including population, penetration, probability of success and sales price, among others. To the extent such payments are greater or less than the Company's initial estimates or the timing of such payments is materially different than its original estimates, the Company will prospectively adjust the amortization of the royalty financing obligations and the effective interest rate. As of March 31, 2024, the estimated effective interest rate was 9.3%.

The following table presents the activity with respect to the liability related to the sale of future royalties.

|  | Carrying Amount (in thousands) |
| --- | --- |
| Carrying value as of September 30, 2023 | 268,326 |
| Non-cash interest expense recognized | 12,612 |
| Carrying value as of March 31, 2024 | 280,938 |

OVERVIEW
--------

The Company develops medicines that treat intractable diseases by silencing the genes that cause them. Using a broad portfolio of RNA chemistries and efficient modes of delivery, the Company's therapies trigger the RNAi interference mechanism to induce rapid, deep and durable knockdown of target genes. RNAi is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene, thereby affecting the production of a specific protein. RNAi-based therapeutics may leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing to target and shut down specific disease-causing genes.

The Company has focused its resources on therapeutics that exclusively utilize its high levels of pharmacologic activity in multiple animal models spanning several therapeutic areas. The Company believes that TRiM enabled therapeutics offer several potential advantages over prior generation and competing technologies, including: simplified manufacturing and reduced costs; multiple routes of administration including subcutaneous injection and inhaled administration; the ability to target multiple tissue types including liver, lung, CNS, muscle and adipose tissue; and the potential for improved safety and reduced risk of intracellular buildup, because there are fewer metabolites from smaller, simpler molecules. TM

The Company's clinical pipeline includes:

* · Hypertriglyceridemia - plozasiran (formerly ARO-APOC3);
* · Dyslipidemia - zodasiran (formerly ARO-ANG3);
* · Cardiovascular disease - olpasiran (formerly AMG 890 or ARO-LPA, out-licensed to Amgen);
* · Muco-obstructive or inflammatory pulmonary conditions - ARO-MUC5AC and ARO-RAGE;
* · Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - ARO-MMP7;
* · Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) - GSK-4532990 (formerly ARO-HSD, out-licensed to GSK);
* · Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) - fazirsiran (formerly ARO-AAT, a collaboration with Takeda);
* · Chronic hepatitis B virus - JNJ-3989 (formerly ARO-HBV, out-licensed to GSK);
* · Complement mediated diseases - ARO-C3;
* · Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) - ARO-PNPLA3 (formerly JNJ-75220795 or ARO-JNJ1);

·

Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy - ARO-DUX4;

* · Dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) - ARO-DM1; and
* · Hepatic expression of complement factor B (CFB) - ARO-CFB.

The Company operates lab facilities in California and Wisconsin, where its research and development activities, including the development of RNAi therapeutics, take place. The Company's principal executive offices are located in Pasadena, California.

The Company continues to develop other clinical candidates for future clinical trials. Clinical candidates are tested internally and through Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicology studies at outside laboratories. Drug materials for such studies and clinical trials are either manufactured internally or contracted to third-party manufacturers. The Company engages third-party contract research organizations (CROs) to manage clinical trials and works cooperatively with such organizations on all aspects of clinical trial management, including plan design, patient recruiting, and follow up. These outside costs, including toxicology/efficacy testing and manufacturing costs, as well as the preparation for and administration of clinical trials, are referred to as "candidate costs." As clinical candidates progress through clinical development, candidate costs will increase.

The First Half of Fiscal 2024 Business Highlights
-------------------------------------------------

Key recent developments through fiscal 2024 included the following:

* · Completed enrollment in Amgen's Phase 3 OCEAN(a) - outcome trial of olpasiran, triggering a $50.0 million milestone payment to the Company, which was paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2024;
* · Presented final data from the double-blind treatment period of the Company's Phase 2 SHASTA-2 study of investigational plozasiran in patients with severe Hypertriglyceridemic. Results from the SHASTA-2 study showed dramatic, consistent, and sustained reductions in Apolipoprotein C-III (APOC3) and triglycerides and improvement in multiple atherogenic lipoprotein levels;
* · Announced an Expanded Access Program (EAP) to make investigational plozasiran available outside of a clinical trial for qualifying patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS);
* · Initiated a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of ARO-DM1, being developed as a potential treatment for type 1 myotonic dystrophy (DM1), the most common adult-onset muscular dystrophy;
* · Filed an application for clearance to initiate a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of ARO-CFB, being developed as a potential treatment for complement mediated renal disease;
* · Entered into an underwriting agreement with Jefferies LLC, BofA Securities, Inc., and Cowen and Company, LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters. The Company issued 15,790,000 shares of common stock at a price of $28.50 per share. The aggregate purchase price paid by investors was $450.0 million and the Company received net proceeds of $429.3 million after deducting advisory fees and offering expenses; and
* · Entered into an Amended and Restated License Agreement with GSK, pursuant to which GSK received a worldwide, exclusive license to develop and commercialize JNJ-3989 (formerly ARO-HBV). JNJ-3989 had previously been licensed to Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. See Note 2 - Collaboration and License Agreements to Consolidated Financial Statements of Part I, "Item 1. Financial Statements."

Net loss attributable to the Company was $125.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to net income attributable to the Company of $48.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Net loss attributable to the Company was $258.2 million for the six months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to net income attributable to the Company of $7.4 million for the six months ended March 31, 2023. Net loss per share - diluted was $1.02 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to net income per share - diluted of $0.45 for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Net loss per share - diluted was $2.24 for the six months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to net income per share - diluted of $0.07 for the six months ended March 31, 2023.

The changes in net loss attributable to the Company for the three and six months ended March 31, 2024 were mainly due to a decrease in revenue from the Company's license and collaboration agreements, in conjunction with increased

research and development expenses, which have continued to increase as the Company's pipeline of candidates has expanded and progressed through clinical trial phases.

The Company had $127.7 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, $395.4 million in available-for-sale securities, and $955.2 million of total assets as of March 31, 2024, as compared to $110.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, $292.7 million in available-for-sale securities and $765.6 million of total assets as of September 30, 2023. Based upon the Company's current cash and investment resources and operating plan, the Company expects to have sufficient liquidity to fund operations for at least the next twelve months.

Critical Accounting Estimates
-----------------------------

There have been no significant changes to the Company's critical accounting estimates disclosed in the most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Revenue
-------

Total revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased by $146.3 million or 100.0% from the same period of 2023. Total revenue for the six months ended March 31, 2024 decreased by $205.3 million, or 98.3% from the same period of 2023. The changes were primarily driven by decreased revenue recognition associated with the Company's license and collaboration agreements during the first half of fiscal 2024. The revenue for the six months ended March 31, 2024 was mainly driven by the revenue recognition associated with Takeda and GSK, as discussed below.

The Company has evaluated each agreement in accordance with FASB Topic 808Collaborative Arrangements and Topic 606Revenue for Contracts from Customers . See Note 2 - Collaboration and License Agreements to Consolidated Financial Statements of Part I, "Item 1. Financial Statements" for more information on revenue recognized under the collaboration and license agreements.

Takeda : In October 2020, Takeda and the Company entered into the Takeda License Agreement. The Company has allocated the total $300.0 million initial transaction price to its one distinct performance obligation for the fazirsiran license and the associated Takeda R&D Services. Revenue was recognized using the input method (based on actual patient visits completed versus total estimated visits completed for the ongoing SEQUOIA and AROAAT2002 clinical studies). The Phase 2 study visits for patients in the SEQUOIA and AROAAT2002 studies concluded by December 31, 2023, and the Company has substantially completed its performance obligation under the Takeda license agreement. As such, all revenue has been fully recognized as of December 31, 2023.

During the six months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recorded $132.5 million revenue, including $40.0 million milestone payment by dosing the first patient in the Phase 3 REDWOOD clinical study of fazirsiran.

GSK : On December 11, 2023, GSK and the Company entered into the GSK HBV Agreement. Under the GSK-HBV Agreement, GSK received a worldwide, exclusive license to develop and commercialize JNJ-3989 (formerly ARO-HBV). JNJ-3989 had previously been licensed to Janssen in October 2018. Under the terms of the GSK-HBV Agreement, the Company received $2.7 million in December 2023, upon signing the GSK-HBV Agreement.

During the six months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recorded a $30.0 million milestone payment by dosing the first patient in a Phase 2b trial under GSK License Agreement.

Horizon/Amgen : During the six months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recorded $6.7 million revenue of the total $40.0 million upfront payment received in July 2021, which was recognized on a straight-line basis over the

timeframe for completing the Horizon R&D Services, concluding in the first quarter of 2023. Horizon enrolled the first subject in December 2022 in a Phase 1 randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of HZN-457, triggering a $15.0 million milestone payment to the Company which was paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Further, Amgen enrolled the first subject in its Phase 3 trial of olpasiran, which triggered a $25.0 million milestone payment to the Company which was paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. On October 6, 2023, Amgen, Inc. completed its acquisition of Horizon and subsequently notified the Company of Amgen's intent to terminate the HZN-457 license. Horizon exercised its right to terminate the Horizon License Agreement for convenience, which took effect on December 21, 2023.

Operating Expenses

The analysis below details the operating expenses and discusses the expenditures of the Company within the major expense categories. For purposes of comparison, the amounts for the three and six months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 are shown in the tables below.

Research and Development (R&D) Expenses
---------------------------------------

R&D expenses are related to the Company's research and development discovery efforts and related candidate costs, which are comprised primarily of outsourced costs related to the manufacturing of clinical supplies, toxicity/efficacy studies and clinical trial expenses. Internal costs primarily relate to discovery operations at the Company's research facilities in California and Wisconsin, including facility costs and laboratory-related expenses. The Company does not separately track R&D expenses by individual research and development project, or by individual drug candidate. The Company operates in a cross-functional manner across projects and does not separately allocate facilities-related costs, candidate costs, discovery costs, compensation expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses, and other expenses related to research and development activities.

The following table provides details of research and development expenses for the periods indicated:

|  | Three Months Ended | % of Expense Category | Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 | % of Expense | Increase (Decrease) | Increase (Decrease) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (in thousands) | March 31, 2024 |  |  | Category | $ | % |
| Candidate costs | $ 33,905 | 34 % | 26,586 | 36 % | $ 7,319 | 28 % |
| R&D discovery costs | 24,786 | 24 % | 17,431 | 23 % | 7,355 | 42 % |
| Salaries | 24,921 | 25 % | 16,404 | 22 % | 8,517 | 52 % |
| Facilities related | 5,923 | 6 % | 3,450 | 4 % | 2,473 | 72 % |
| Total research and development expense, excluding non- cash expense | $ 89,535 | 89 % | 63,871 | 85 % | $ 25,664 | 40 % |
| Stock compensation | 7,487 | 7 % | 8,745 | 12 % | (1,258) | (14) % |
| Depreciation and amortization | 4,100 | 4 % | 2,265 | 3 % | 1,835 | 81 % |
| Total research and development expense | $ 101,122 | 100 % | 74,881 | 100 % | $ 26,241 | 35 % |

|  |  | % of |  | % of | Increase (Decrease) | Increase (Decrease) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (in thousands) | Six Months Ended March 31, 2024 | Expense Category | Six Months Ended March 31, 2023 | Expense Category | $ | % |
| Candidate costs | $ 79,179 | 36 % | $ 68,870 | 43 % | $ 10,309 | 15 % |
| R&D discovery costs | 54,008 | 25 % | 30,124 | 19 % | 23,884 | 79 % |
| Salaries | 47,516 | 22 % | 31,093 | 20 % | 16,423 | 53 % |
| Facilities related | 12,465 | 6 % | 6,791 | 4 % | 5,674 | 84 % |
| Total research and development expense, excluding non-cash expense | $ 193,168 | 89 % | $ 136,878 | 86 % | $ 56,290 | 41 % |
| Stock compensation | 16,494 | 7 % | 17,147 | 11 % | (653) | (4) % |
| Depreciation/amortization | 7,951 | 4 % | 4,551 | 3 % | 3,400 | 75 % |
| Total research and development expense | $ 217,613 | 100 % | $ 158,576 | 100 % | $ 59,037 | 37 % |

Candidate costs increased $7.3 million, or 28%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $10.3 million, or 15%, for the six months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. This increase was primarily due to the additional progression of the Company's pipeline of candidates into and through clinical trials, which resulted in higher

manufacturing, outsourced clinical trial, and toxicity study costs.

R&D discovery costs increased $7.4 million, or 42%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $23.9 million, or 79%, for the six months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. This increase was primarily driven by the growth of the Company's discovery efforts and continued advancement into novel therapeutic areas and tissue types, particularly due to an increase in labor along with rising costs associated with CNS studies and lab supplies.

Salaries and stock compensation expense consist of salary, bonuses, payroll taxes, related benefits and stock compensation for the Company's R&D personnel. The increase in salaries for the three and six months ended March 31, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in R&D headcount that has occurred as the Company has expanded its pipeline of candidates, in addition to annual salary increases. Stock compensation expense was based upon the valuation of stock options and restricted stock units granted to employees and directors. The decrease in stock compensation expense for the three and six months ended March 31, 2024 was primarily due to the cancelled awards upon the departure of employees.

Facilities-related expense includes lease costs for the Company's research and development facilities in San Diego, California and Madison, Wisconsin. Facilitiesrelated costs increased $2.5 million, or 72%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $5.7 million, or 84%, for the six months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. This increase was mainly due to the ATIAs on the lease in San Diego, California. See Note 8 - Leases of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Part I, "Item 1. Financial Statements."

Depreciation and amortization expense, a non-cash expense, increased $1.8 million, or 81% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $3.4 million, or 75%, for the six months ended March 31, 2024, compared to the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily attributed to higher leasehold improvements, due to completion of the development of the San Diego facility. Additionally, as of December 31, 2023, the Company completed the build out of one of its laboratory and office facilities in Verona, Wisconsin, and commenced depreciation.

The Company anticipates these R&D expenses to continue to increase as its pipeline of candidates grows and progresses to later phase clinical trials, in addition to inflationary pressure on goods and services and the labor market.

| Total general & administrative expenses | $ 48,674 | 100 % | $ 44,206 | 100 % | $ 4,468 | 10 % |

Salaries expense increased $2.1 million, or 42%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $4.1 million, or 45%, for the six months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The increase was driven by the

combination of annual salary increases and increased headcount required to support the Company's growth.

Professional, outside services, and other expense includes legal, consulting, patent expenses, business insurance expenses, other outside services, travel, and communication and technology expenses. This expense increased $1.4 million, or 28%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $2.2 million, or 24%, for the six months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The increase was mainly due to legal services associated with new patent applications and intellectual property matters, as well as other professional services.

Facilities related expense primarily includes rental costs and other facilities-related costs for the Company's corporate headquarters in Pasadena, California.

Stock compensation expense, a non-cash expense, was based upon the valuation of stock options and restricted stock units granted to employees. This expense decreased $1.6 million, or 14%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and $1.9 million, or 8%, for the six months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The decrease was mainly due to the decreased compensation costs related to performance awards.

Depreciation and amortization expense, a noncash expense, was primarily related to amortization of leasehold improvements for the Company's corporate headquarters.

The Company anticipates these general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as its pipeline of candidates grows and progresses to later phase clinical trials, in addition to inflationary pressure on goods and services and the labor market.

Other Income (Expense)
----------------------

Other income (expense) is primarily related to interest income and expense. Other expense increased $0.3 million and $2.8 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2024, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2023. The increase was primarily due to the non-cash interest expense on the liability related to the sale of future royalties, partially offset by higher yields on investments due to increased interest rates.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
-------------------------------

The Company has historically financed its operations through the sale of its equity securities, revenue from its licensing and collaboration agreements, and the sale of certain future royalties. Research and development activities have required significant capital investment since the Company's inception and are expected to continue to require significant cash expenditure as the Company's pipeline continues to expand and matures into later stage clinical trials. Additionally, the Company expanded its facilities in Verona, Wisconsin and leased additional facilities in San Diego, California. Each of these expansions is designed to increase the Company's internal manufacturing and discovery capabilities and requires significant capital investment.

The Company's cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash increased to $127.7 million at March 31, 2024 compared to $110.9 million at September 30, 2023. Cash invested in available-for-sale securities was $395.4 million at March 31, 2024 compared to $292.7 million at September 30, 2023.

On December 2, 2022, the Company entered into the Open Market Sale Agreement, pursuant to which the Company may, from time to time, sell up to $250.0 million in shares of the Company's common stock through Jefferies LLC, acting as the sales agent and/or principal, in an at-the-market offering. As of March 31, 2024, no shares have been issued under the Open Market Sale Agreement.

On January 2, 2024, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with Jefferies LLC, BofA Securities, Inc., and Cowen and Company, LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters. The Company issued 15,790,000 shares of common stock at an offering price of $28.50 per share. The aggregate purchase price paid by investors was $450.0 million and the Company received net proceeds of $429.3 million after deducting advisory fees and offering expenses.

The Company believes its current financial resources are sufficient to fund its operations through at least the next twelve months.

The following table presents a summary of cash flows:

|  | Six Months Ended March 31, | Six Months Ended March 31, |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | 2024 | 2023 |

During the six months ended March 31, 2024, cash flow used in operating activities was $210.2 million, which was primarily due to the ongoing expenses related to the Company's research and development programs and general and administrative expenses. Cash used in investing activities amounted to $204.1 million, which was primarily attributable to capital expenditures of $102.7 million and investment purchases of $310.0 million, offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $208.6 million. Cash provided by financing activities of $431.0 million was primarily related to cash received from the issuance of common stock as well as stock option exercises (See Note 6 - Stockholders' Equity of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Part I, "Item 1. Financial Statements.").

During the six months ended March 31, 2023, cash flows used by operating activities was $107.2 million, which was primarily due to the ongoing expenses related to the Company's research and development programs and general and administrative expenses, partially offset by the receipt of $40.0 million from Amgen and Horizon. Cash used in investing activities was $116.8 million, which was primarily related to capital expenditures, $66.2 million of construction in progress and investment purchases of $192.5 million, offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $142.0 million. Cash provided by financing activities of $251.1 million was primarily related to the $250.0 million payment from Royalty Pharma as well as cash received from stock option exercises.
