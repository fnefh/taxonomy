NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
--------------------------------------------------------

General and Recent Developments
-------------------------------

Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries (referred to herein collectively as the "Company") are primarily engaged in developing medicines that treat intractable diseases by silencing the genes that cause them. Using a broad portfolio of RNA chemistries and efficient modes of delivery, the Company's therapies trigger the RNA interference mechanism to induce rapid, deep and durable knockdown of target genes. RNA interference ("RNAi") is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene, thereby affecting the production of a specific protein. The Company's RNAi-based therapeutics may leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing to target and shut down specific disease-causing genes.

The following table presents the Company's current pipeline:

| Therapeutic Area | Name | Stage | Product Rights |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cardiometabolic | Plozasiran (ARO-APOC3) | Two Phase 2b and one Phase 3 | Arrowhead |
|  | Zodasiran (ARO-ANG3) | Two Phase 2b | Arrowhead |
|  | Olpasiran | Phase 3 | Amgen |
| Pulmonary | ARO-RAGE | Phase 1/2a | Arrowhead |
|  | ARO-MUC5AC | Phase 1/2a | Arrowhead |
|  | ARO-MMP7 | Phase 1/2a | Arrowhead |
| Liver | GSK-4532990 | Phase 2b | GSK |
|  | Fazirsiran | Phase 3 | Takeda and Arrowhead |
|  | JNJ-3989 | Phase 2 | GSK |
|  | ARO-C3 | Phase 1/2a | Arrowhead |
|  | ARO-PNPLA3 | Phase 1 | Arrowhead |
|  | ARO-CFB | Phase 1/2a | Arrowhead |
| Muscle | ARO-DUX4 | Phase 1/2a | Arrowhead |
|  | ARO-DM1 | Phase 1/2a | Arrowhead |
| Central Nervous System (CNS) | Various | Pre-Clinical | Arrowhead |

The Company operates lab facilities in California and Wisconsin, where its research and development activities, including the development of RNAi therapeutics, take place. The Company's principal executive offices are located in Pasadena, California.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company continued to develop and advance its pipeline and partnered candidates. Several key recent developments include:

* · Filed an application for clearance to initiate a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of ARO-CFB, being developed as a potential treatment for complement mediated renal disease;
* · Filed an application for clearance to initiate a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of ARO-DM1, being developed as a potential treatment for type 1 myotonic dystrophy (DM1), the most common adult-onset muscular dystrophy; and
* · Entered into an Amended and Restated License Agreement with GSK, pursuant to which GSK received a worldwide, exclusive license to develop and commercialize JNJ-3989 (formerly ARO-HBV). JNJ-3989 had previously been licensed to Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. See Note 2.

Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
---------------------------------------

The interim Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries (wholly-owned subsidiaries and a variable interest entity for which the Company is the primary beneficiary). Subsidiaries refer to Arrowhead Madison, Inc., Visirna Therapeutics, Inc. ("Visirna"), and Arrowhead Australia Pty Ltd.

For subsidiaries in which the Company owns or is exposed to less than 100% of the economics, the Company records net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in its consolidated statements of operations equal to the percentage of the economic or ownership interests retained in such entity by the respective noncontrolling party.

The interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The financial data of the Company included herein are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all material adjustments of a normal recurring nature have been made to present fairly the Company's financial position at December 31, 2023 and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

Certain financial information that is normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, but that is not required for interim reporting purposes, has been omitted from the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements and related notes. Readers are urged to review the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023 for more complete descriptions and discussions. Operating results and cash flows for the three months ended December 31, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024.

Liquidity
---------

The Company's primary sources of financing have been through the sale of its equity securities, revenue from its licensing and collaboration agreements and the sale of certain future royalties. Research and development activities have required significant capital investment since the Company's inception and are expected to continue to require significant cash expenditure in the future, particularly as the Company's pipeline of drug candidates and its headcount have both expanded. Additionally, significant capital investment will be required as the Company's pipeline matures into later stage clinical trials.

As of December 31, 2023, the Company had $58.2 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash ($6.9 million in restricted cash) and $162.1 million in availablefor-sale debt securities to fund operations. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company's cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and investments balance decreased by $183.3 million which was primarily due to the ongoing expenses related to the Company's research and development programs and general and administrative expenses and capital expenditures. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company received the $250.0 million upfront payment from Royalty Pharma (Note 11).

On January 2, 2024, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with Jefferies LLC, BofA Securities, Inc., and Cowen and Company, LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters. The Company issued 15,790,000 shares of common stock at a price of $28.50 per share. The aggregate purchase price paid by investors was $450.0 million and the Company received net proceeds of $429.0 million after deducting advisory fees and offering expenses.

In total, the Company is eligible to receive up to $2.8 billion in developmental, regulatory and sales milestones, and may receive various royalties on net sales from its licensing and collaboration agreements, subject to the terms and conditions of those agreements. The revenue recognition for these collaboration agreements is discussed further in Note 2.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
------------------------------------------

There have been no changes to the significant accounting policies disclosed in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.

Uncertainty in Income Taxes
---------------------------

The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $3.3 million and $0 for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The income tax benefit is primarily due to the discrete change in the Company's uncertain tax positions related to the statute of limitation expiration.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
--------------------------------

In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , to improve its income tax disclosure requirements. Under the ASU, entities must annually (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. This ASU will become effective for the Company beginning on October 1, 2025. The Company does not expect any material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures resulting from applying this ASU.

Glaxosmithkline Intellectual Property (No. 3) Limited ("GSK")
-------------------------------------------------------------

GSK License Agreement
---------------------

On November 22, 2021, GSK and the Company entered into an Exclusive License Agreement (the "GSK License Agreement"). Under the GSK License Agreement, GSK has received an exclusive license for GSK-4532990 (formerly ARO-HSD). The exclusive license is worldwide with the exception of greater China. GSK is wholly responsible for all clinical development and commercialization of GSK-4532990 in its territory. GSK dosed the first patient in a Phase 2b trial in March 2023 and paid a $30.0 million milestone payment to the Company in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.

The Company is eligible for an additional payment of $100.0 million upon achieving the first patient dosed in a Phase 3 trial. Furthermore, should the Phase 3 trial read out positively, and the potential new medicine receives regulatory approval in major markets, the deal provides for commercial milestone payments to the Company of up to $190.0 million at first commercial sale, and up to $590.0 million in sales-related milestone payments. The Company is further eligible to receive tiered royalties on net product sales in a range of mid-teens to twenty percent.

GSK-HBV Agreement
-----------------

On December 11, 2023, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated License Agreement with GSK (the "GSK-HBV Agreement") pursuant to which GSK received a worldwide, exclusive license to develop and commercialize JNJ-3989 (formerly ARO-HBV), the Company's third-generation subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic candidate being developed as a potential therapy for patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. JNJ-3989 had previously been licensed to Janssen in October 2018.

Under the terms of the GSK-HBV Agreement, the Company received $2.7 million in December 2023, upon signing the amended GSK-HBV Agreement. The Company is eligible to receive up to $832.5 million in development and sales milestone payments under the GSK-HBV Agreement.

There were no contract assets and liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2023.

Horizon Therapeutics Ireland DAC ("Horizon")
--------------------------------------------

In June 2021, Horizon and the Company entered into a collaboration and license agreement (the "Horizon License Agreement"). Under the terms of the Horizon License Agreement, Horizon received a worldwide exclusive license for HZN-457, a clinical-stage medicine being developed by Horizon as a potential treatment for people with uncontrolled gout.

At the inception of the Horizon License Agreement, the Company identified one distinct performance obligation. The Company determined that the key deliverables included the license and certain R&D services, including the Company's responsibilities to conduct all activities through the preclinical stages of development of HZN-457 (the "Horizon R&D Services"). The Company received a $40.0 million upfront payment in July 2021. Revenue was recognized

on a straight-line basis over the timeframe for completing the Horizon R&D Services, concluding in the first quarter of 2023. Further, the Company received an additional $15.0 million upon Horizon's initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial in January 2023.

On October 6, 2023, Amgen completed its acquisition of Horizon and subsequently notified the Company of Amgen's intent to terminate the HZN-457 license. Horizon exercised its right to terminate the Horizon License Agreement for convenience, which took effect on December 21, 2023.

Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited ("Takeda")
------------------------------------------------

In October 2020, Takeda and the Company entered into an Exclusive License and Co-Funding Agreement (the "Takeda License Agreement"). Under the Takeda License Agreement, Takeda and the Company will co-develop the Company's Fazirsiran program (formerly TAK-999 and ARO-AAT), the Company's second-generation subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic candidate being developed as a treatment for liver disease associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Within the United States, fazirsiran, if approved, will be co-commercialized under a 50/ 50 profit sharing structure. Outside the United States, Takeda received an exclusive license to commercialize fazirsiran and will lead the global commercialization strategy, while the Company will be eligible to receive tiered royalties of 20% to 25% on net sales.

At the inception of the Takeda License Agreement, the Company identified one distinct performance obligation. The Company determined that the key deliverables included the license and certain R&D services including the Company's responsibilities to complete the initial portion of the SEQUOIA study, to complete the ongoing Phase 2 AROAAT2002 study and to ensure certain manufacturing of fazirsiran drug product is completed and delivered to Takeda (the "Takeda R&D Services"). Due to the specialized and unique nature of these Takeda R&D Services and their direct relationship with the license, the Company determined that these deliverables represent one distinct bundle and, thus, one performance obligation. Beyond the Takeda R&D Services, which are the responsibility of the Company, Takeda will be responsible for managing future clinical development and commercialization outside the United States. Within the United States, the Company will also participate in co-development and cocommercialization efforts and will co-fund these efforts with Takeda as part of the 50/50 profit sharing structure within the United States. The Company considers the collaborative activities, including the co-development and co-commercialization, to be a separate unit of account within Topic 808, and as such, these co-funding amounts are recorded as research and development expenses or general and administrative expenses, as appropriate.

Under the terms of the Takeda License Agreement, the Company received $300.0 million as an upfront payment in January 2021 and an additional $40.0 million upon Takeda's initiation of a Phase 3 REDWOOD clinical study of fazirsiran in March 2023, and is eligible to receive up to $ 527.5 million in additional potential development, regulatory and commercial milestones.

The Company has allocated the total $300.0 million initial transaction price to itsone distinct performance obligation for the fazirsiran license and the associated Takeda R&D Services. Revenue is recognized using the input method (based on actual patient visits completed versus total estimated visits completed for the ongoing SEQUOIA and AROAAT2002 clinical studies). The Company previously expected these clinical trials to extend to September 2025 in order to demonstrate long term safety and efficacy in the open label extension (OLE) part of the studies; however, in August 2023, Takeda initiated a Phase 3 OLE study, concluding the Phase 2 study visits for patients in the SEQUOIA and AROAAT2002 studies by December 31, 2023. Consequently, the Company adjusted its revenue recognition estimates in the fiscal year 2023 to align with the revised performance period, resulting in accelerated revenue of $70.5 million, or $0.66 per diluted share, for the year ended September 30, 2023. The remaining $0.9 million of deferred revenue was recognized for the three months ended December 31, 2023. There were no further contract liabilities as of December 31, 2023 .

The Company also recorded $11.1 million as accrued expenses as of December 31, 2023 that was primarily driven by co-development and co-commercialization activities.

On March 18, 2021, the Company's Board of Directors approved the Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2021 Incentive Plan (the "2021 Plan"), which authorized 8,000,000 shares (subject to certain adjustments) available for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted and unrestricted stock, performance awards, cash awards and other awards convertible into or otherwise based on shares of the Company's common stock. The maximum number of shares authorized under the 2021 Plan will be (i) reduced by any shares subject to awards made under the 2013 Plan after January 1, 2021, and (ii) increased by any shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2013 Plan as of January 1, 2021 that, after January 1, 2021, are canceled, expired, forfeited or otherwise not issued under such awards (other than as a result of being tendered or withheld to pay the exercise price or withholding taxes in connection with any such awards) or settled in cash.

Stock Option Awards
-------------------

The following table presents a summary of the stock option activity for the three months ended December 31, 2023:

|  | Shares | Weighted- Average Exercise Price Per Share | Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Term (Years) | Aggregate Intrinsic Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Outstanding at September 30, 2023 | 2,263,477 | $ 22.68 |  |  |
| Granted | - | - |  |  |
| Cancelled or expired | (29,457) | 61.11 |  |  |
| Exercised | (33,825) | 8.30 |  |  |
| Outstanding at December 31, 2023 | 2,200,195 | $ 22.46 | 4.1 years | $ 31,862,157 |
| Exercisable at December 31, 2023 | 2,118,298 | $ 21.72 | 3.9 years | $ 31,840,866 |

The aggregate intrinsic values represent the amount by which the market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised during the three months ended December 31, 2023

and 2022 was $0.6 million and $2.3 million, respectively.

Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options outstanding for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, was $1.5 million and $2.4 million, respectively.

As of December 31, 2023, the pre-tax compensation expense for all outstanding unvested stock options in the amount of $1.4 million will be recognized in the Company's results of operations over a weighted average period of 5 months.

The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which do not have vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. The determination of the fair value of each stock option is affected by the Company's stock price on the date of grant, as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. Because the Company's employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options. No options were granted during the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Visirna ESOP : On October 1, 2023, Visirna, a subsidiary of the Company, granted 7,500,000 stock options to its employees from the Employee Stock Option Plan (the "Visirna ESOP"), which authorizes 20,000,000 shares for issuance. The Visirna ESOP is independently managed by Visirna, including the valuation process. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, stock-based compensation expense related to the Visirna ESOP was $2.0 million.

Restricted Stock Units
----------------------

Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs"), including market-based, time-based and performance-based awards, have been granted under the Company's 2013 and 2021 Plans and as inducements grants granted outside of the Company's equity-based compensation plans. At vesting, each outstanding RSU will be exchanged for one share of the Company's common stock. RSU awards generally vest subject to the satisfaction of service requirements or the satisfaction of both service requirements and achievement of certain performance targets.

The following table summarizes the activity of the Company's RSUs:

|  | Number of RSUs | Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Outstanding at September 30, 2023 | 4,241,640 | $ 58.43 |
| Granted | 511,290 | 29.48 |
| Vested | (153,457) | 47.76 |
| Forfeited | (14,775) | 51.21 |
| Outstanding at December 31, 2023 | 4,584,698 | $ 55.58 |

The fair value of RSUs was determined based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the grant date, with consideration given to the probability of achieving service and/or performance conditions for awards.

For the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded $16.2 million and $17.0 million of expense related to RSUs, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, there was $91.9 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of1.5 years.

NOTE 10. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
--------------------------------

The Company employs a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The Company's valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value and the definition of the three levels (Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3) of the fair value hierarchy are disclosed in Note 10 - Fair Value Measurements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Part IV, "Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules" of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023.

The Company uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including during periods of market disruption. In periods of market disruption, the ability to observe prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2, or from Level 2 to Level 3. The Company recognizes transfers between levels at either the actual date of the event or a change in circumstances that caused the transfer. At December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2023, the Company did not have any financial assets or financial liabilities based on Level 3 measurements.

NOTE 11. LIABILITY RELATED TO THE SALE OF FUTURE ROYALTIES
----------------------------------------------------------

In November 2022, the Company and Royalty Pharma entered into the Royalty Pharma Agreement, pursuant to which Royalty Pharma agreed to pay up to $410.0 million in cash to the Company in consideration for the Company's future royalty interest in olpasiran, a small interfering RNA (siRNA) originally developed by the Company and licensed to Amgen in September 2016 under the Olpasiran Agreement.

Pursuant to the Royalty Pharma Agreement, Royalty Pharma paid $250.0 million upfront and agreed to pay up to an additional $160.0 million in aggregate one-time milestone payments due if and when the following milestone events occur: (i) $50.0 million on completion of enrollment in the OCEAN Phase 3 clinical trial for olpasiran, (ii) $50.0 million upon receipt of FDA approval of olpasiran for an approved indication (reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction, urgent coronary revascularization, or coronary heart disease death in adults with established cardiovascular disease and elevated

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

Lp(a)), and (iii) $60.0 million upon Royalty Pharma's receipt of at least $70.0 million of royalty payments under the Royalty Pharma Agreement in any single calendar year.

In consideration for the payment of the foregoing amounts under the Royalty Pharma Agreement, Royalty Pharma is entitled to receive all royalties otherwise payable by Amgen to the Company under the Olpasiran Agreement. The Company remains eligible to receive any milestone payments potentially payable by Amgen under the Olpasiran Agreement.

The Company has evaluated the terms of the Royalty Pharma Agreement and concluded in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance that the Company accounted for the transaction as debt and the funding of $250.0 million from Royalty Pharma was recorded as a liability related to the sale of future royalties on its consolidated balance sheets. The Company is not obligated to repay this upfront funding received under the Royalty Pharma Agreement. This liability is amortized over the expected repayment term using an effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is calculated based on the rate that would enable the debt to be repaid in full over the anticipated life of the arrangement. The interest rate may vary during the term of the agreement depending on a number of factors, including the amount and timing of forecasted net revenues which affects the repayment timing and ultimate amount of repayment. The Company will evaluate the effective interest rate periodically based on its current revenue forecasts utilizing the prospective method. For the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized non-cash interest expense of $5.4 million and $2.8 million, respectively, on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.

NOTE 12. EARNINGS PER SHARE

OVERVIEW
--------

The Company develops medicines that treat intractable diseases by silencing the genes that cause them. Using a broad portfolio of RNA chemistries and efficient modes of delivery, the Company's therapies trigger the RNAi interference mechanism to induce rapid, deep and durable knockdown of target genes. RNAi is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene, thereby affecting the production of a specific protein. RNAi-based therapeutics may leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing to target and shut down specific disease-causing genes.

The Company has focused its resources on therapeutics that exclusively utilize its high levels of pharmacologic activity in multiple animal models spanning several therapeutic areas. The Company believes that TRiM enabled therapeutics offer several potential advantages over prior generation and competing technologies, including: simplified manufacturing and reduced costs; multiple routes of administration including subcutaneous injection and inhaled administration; the ability to target multiple tissue types including liver, lung, CNS, muscle and adipose tissue; and the potential for improved safety and reduced risk of intracellular buildup, because there are fewer metabolites from smaller, simpler molecules. TM

The Company's clinical pipeline includes:

* · Hypertriglyceridemia - Plozasiran (formerly ARO-APOC3);
* · Dyslipidemia - Zodasiran (formerly ARO-ANG3);
* · Cardiovascular disease - olpasiran (formerly AMG 890 or ARO-LPA, out-licensed to Amgen) ;
* · Muco-obstructive or inflammatory pulmonary conditions - ARO-MUC5AC and ARO-RAGE;
* · Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - ARO-MMP7;
* · Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) - GSK-4532990 (formerly ARO-HSD, out-licensed to GSK);
* · Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) - fazirsiran (formerly ARO-AAT, a collaboration with Takeda);
* · Chronic hepatitis B virus - JNJ-3989 (formerly ARO-HBV, out-licensed to GSK);
* · Complement mediated diseases - ARO-C3;
* · Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) - ARO-PNPLA3 (formerly JNJ-75220795 or ARO-JNJ1);

·

Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy - ARO-DUX4;

* · Dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) - ARO-DM1; and
* · Hepatic expression of complement factor B (CFB) - ARO-CFB.

The Company operates lab facilities in California and Wisconsin, where its research and development activities, including the development of RNAi therapeutics, take place. The Company's principal executive offices are located in Pasadena, California.

The Company continues to develop other clinical candidates for future clinical trials. Clinical candidates are tested internally and through GLP toxicology studies at outside laboratories. Drug materials for such studies and clinical trials are either manufactured internally or contracted to third-party manufacturers. The Company engages third-party contract research organizations (CROs) to manage clinical trials and works cooperatively with such organizations on all aspects of clinical trial management, including plan design, patient recruiting, and follow up. These outside costs, relating to the preparation for and administration of clinical trials, are referred to as "candidate costs." As clinical candidates progress through clinical development, candidate costs will increase.

The First Quarter of Fiscal 2024 Business Highlights
----------------------------------------------------

Key recent developments during the first quarter of fiscal 2024 included the following:

* · Entered into an underwriting agreement with Jefferies LLC, BofA Securities, Inc., and Cowen and Company, LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters. The Company issued 15,790,000 shares of common stock at a price of $28.50 per share. The aggregate purchase price paid by investors was $450.0 million and the Company received net proceeds of $429.0 million after deducting advisory fees and offering expenses;
* · Filed an application for clearance to initiate a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of ARO-CFB, being developed as a potential treatment for complement mediated renal disease;
* · Filed an application for clearance to initiate a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of ARO-DM1, being developed as a potential treatment for type 1 myotonic dystrophy (DM1), the most common adult-onset muscular dystrophy; and
* · Entered into an Amended and Restated License Agreement with GSK, pursuant to which GSK received a worldwide, exclusive license to develop and commercialize JNJ-3989 (formerly ARO-HBV). JNJ-3989 had previously been licensed to Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. See Note 2.

Net loss was $132.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 as compared to $41.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022. Net loss per share - diluted was $1.24 for the three months ended December 31, 2023 as compared to $0.39 for the three months ended December 31, 2022.

The changes in net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2023 were due to the combination of a decrease in revenue and an increase in research and development expenses, which have continued to increase as the Company's pipeline of candidates has expanded and progressed through clinical trial phases.

The Company had $58.2 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, $162.1 million in available-for-sale securities, and $626.3 million of total assets as of December 31, 2023, as compared to $110.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, $292.7 million in available-for-sale securities and $765.6 million of total assets as of September 30, 2023. Based upon the Company's current cash and investment resources, operating plan, and factoring in the $429.0 million in net proceeds from the January 2024 stock offering, the Company expects to have sufficient liquidity to fund operations for at least the next twelve months.

Critical Accounting Estimates
-----------------------------

There have been no significant changes to the Company's critical accounting estimates disclosed in the most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
---------------------

The following data summarizes the Company's results of operations for the following periods indicated:

|  | Three Months Ended December 31, | Three Months Ended December 31, | Three Months Ended December 31, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | 2023 | 2023 | 2022 |
|  | (in thousands, except per share amounts) | (in thousands, except per share amounts) | (in thousands, except per share amounts) |
| Revenue | $ | 3,551 | $ 62,546 |
| Operating loss | $ | (136,545) | $ (42,134) |
| Net loss attributable to Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. | $ | (132,864) | $ (41,325) |
| Net loss per share-diluted | $ | (1.24) | $ (0.39) |

Revenue
-------

Total revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2023 decreased by $59.0 million, or 94.3% from the same period of 2022. The revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2023 were mainly driven by the revenue recognition associated with GSK and Takeda, as discussed below.

The Company has evaluated each agreement in accordance with FASB Topic 808Collaborative Arrangements and Topic 606Revenue for Contracts from Customers . See Note 2 - Collaboration and License Agreements to Consolidated Financial Statements of Part I, "Item 1. Financial Statements" for more information on revenue recognized under the collaboration and license agreements.

GSK : On December 11, 2023, GSK and the Company entered into the GSK HBV Agreement. Under the GSK-HBV Agreement, GSK received a worldwide, exclusive license to develop and commercialize JNJ-3989 (formerly ARO-HBV). JNJ-3989 had previously been licensed to Janssen in October 2018. Under the terms of the GSK-HBV Agreement, the Company received $2.7 million in December 2023, upon signing the GSK-HBV Agreement.

Takeda : In October 2020, Takeda and the Company entered into the Takeda License Agreement. The Company has allocated the total $300.0 million initial transaction price to its one distinct performance obligation for the fazirsiran license and the associated Takeda R&D Services. Revenue is recognized using the input method (based on actual patient visits completed versus total estimated visits completed for the ongoing SEQUOIA and AROAAT2002 clinical studies). The Company previously expected these clinical trials to extend to September 2025 in order to demonstrate long term safety and efficacy in the open label extension (OLE) part of the studies; however, in August 2023, Takeda initiated a Phase 3 OLE study, concluding the Phase 2 study visits for patients in the SEQUOIA and AROAAT2002 studies by December 31, 2023. Consequently, the Company adjusted its revenue recognition estimates in the fiscal 2023 to align with the revised performance period and the remaining $0.9 million deferred revenue was recognized for the three months ended December 31, 2023. The Company recognized $16.3 million revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022.

Horizon/Amgen : During the three months ended December 31, 2022, Horizon recorded $6.7 million revenue of the total $40.0 million upfront payment received in July 2021, which was recognized on a straight-line basis over the timeframe for completing the Horizon R&D Services, concluding in the first quarter of 2023. Horizon also enrolled the first subject in December 2022 in a Phase 1 randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of HZN-457, triggering a $15.0 million milestone payment to the Company which was paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Further, Amgen enrolled the first subject in its Phase 3 trial of olpasiran, which triggered a $25.0 million milestone payment to the Company which was paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. On October 6, 2023, Amgen,,Inc. completed its acquisition of Horizon and subsequently notified the Company of Amgen's intent to terminate the HZN-457 license. Horizon exercised its right to terminate the Horizon License Agreement for convenience, which took effect on December 21, 2023.

Operating Expenses
------------------

The analysis below details the operating expenses and discusses the expenditures of the Company within the major expense categories. For purposes of comparison, the amounts for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 are shown in the tables below.

Research and Development (R&D) Expenses
---------------------------------------

R&D expenses are related to the Company's research and development discovery efforts and related candidate costs, which are comprised primarily of outsourced costs related to the manufacturing of clinical supplies, toxicity/efficacy studies and clinical trial expenses. Internal costs primarily relate to discovery operations at the Company's research facilities in California and Wisconsin, including facility costs and laboratory-related expenses. The Company does not separately track R&D expenses by individual research and development projects, or by individual drug candidates. The Company operates in a cross-functional manner across projects and does not separately allocate facilities-related costs, candidate costs, discovery costs, compensation expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses, and other expenses related to research and development activities.

The following table provides details of research and development expenses for the periods indicated:

|  | Three Months Ended | % of Expense Category | Three Months Ended | % of Expense | Increase (Decrease) | Increase (Decrease) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (in thousands) | December 31, 2023 |  | December 31, 2022 | Category | $ | % |
| Candidate costs | $ 45,274 | 39 % | $ 42,284 | 51 % | $ 2,990 | 7 % |
| R&D discovery costs | 29,222 | 25 % | 12,693 | 15 % | 16,529 | 130 % |
| Salaries | 22,595 | 19 % | 14,689 | 17 % | 7,906 | 54 % |
| Facilities related | 6,542 | 6 % | 3,341 | 4 % | 3,201 | 96 % |
| Total research and development expense, excluding non- cash expense | $ 103,633 | 89 % | $ 73,007 | 87 % | $ 30,626 | 42 % |
| Stock compensation | 9,007 | 8 % | 8,402 | 10 % | 605 | 7 % |
| Depreciation and amortization | 3,851 | 3 % | 2,286 | 3 % | 1,565 | 68 % |
| Total research and development expense | $ 116,491 | 100 % | $ 83,695 | 100 % | $ 32,796 | 39 % |

Candidate costs increased $3.0 million, or 7%, for the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022. This increase was primarily due to the additional progression of the Company's pipeline of candidates into and through clinical trials, which resulted in higher manufacturing, outsourced clinical trial, and toxicity study costs.

R&D discovery costs increased $16.5 million, or 130%, for the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022. This increase was primarily driven by the growth of the Company's discovery efforts and continued advancement into novel therapeutic areas and tissue types, particularly due to an increase in labor along with rising costs associated with CNS studies and lab supplies.

Salaries and stock compensation expense consist of salary, bonuses, payroll taxes, related benefits and stock compensation for the Company's R&D personnel. The increases in salaries and stock comp expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2023 were primarily due to an increase in R&D headcount that has occurred as the Company has expanded its pipeline of candidates, in addition to annual salary increases. Stock compensation expense was based upon the valuation of stock options and restricted stock units granted to employees and directors.

Facilities-related expense included lease costs for the Company's research and development facilities in San Diego, California and Madison, Wisconsin. Facilitiesrelated costs increased $3.2 million, or 96%, for the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022. This increase was mainly due to the additional lease expense in San Diego, California as the Company expands discovery efforts to identify new drug candidates.

Depreciation and amortization expense, a non-cash expense, increased $1.6 million, or 68% for the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022. The increase was primarily attributed to higher leasehold improvements, due to completion of the development of the San Diego facility. Additionally, as of December 31, 2023, the Company completed the build out of one of its laboratory and office facilities in Verona, Wisconsin, and commenced depreciation.

The Company anticipates these R&D expenses to continue to increase as its pipeline of candidates grows and progresses to later phase clinical trials, in addition to inflationary pressure on goods and services and the labor market.

General & Administrative Expenses
---------------------------------

The following table provides details of the Company's general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated:

|  | Three Months Ended | % of Expense | Three Months Ended | % of Expense | Increase (Decrease) | Increase (Decrease) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (in thousands) | December 31, 2023 | Category | December 31, 2022 | Category | $ | % |
| Salaries | $ 6,259 | 27 % | $ 4,207 | 20 % | $ 2,052 | 49 % |
| Professional, outside services, and other | 5,222 | 22 % | 4,383 | 21 % | 839 | 19 % |
| Facilities related | 1,025 | 4 % | 1,005 | 5 % | 20 | 2 % |
| Total general & administrative expense, excluding non-cash expense | $ 12,506 | 53 % | $ 9,595 | 46 % | $ 2,911 | 30 % |
| Stock compensation | 10,687 | 45 % | 10,987 | 52 % | (300) | (3) % |
| Depreciation and amortization | 412 | 2 % | 403 | 2 % | 9 | 2 % |
| Total general & administrative expense | $ 23,605 | 100 % | $ 20,985 | 100 % | $ 2,620 | 12 % |

Salaries expense increased $2.1 million, or 49%, for the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022. The increase was driven by the combination of annual salary increases and increased headcount required to support the Company's growth.

Professional, outside services, and other expense includes legal, consulting, patent expenses, business insurance expenses, other outside services, travel, and communication and technology expenses. This expense increased $0.8 million, or 19%, for the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022. The increase was mainly due to legal services associated with new patent applications and intellectual property matters.

Facilities related expense primarily includes rental costs and other facilities-related costs for the Company's corporate headquarters in Pasadena, California.

Stock compensation expense, a non-cash expense, was based upon the valuation of stock options and restricted stock units granted to employees.

Depreciation and amortization expense, a noncash expense, was primarily related to amortization of leasehold improvements for the Company's corporate headquarters.

The Company anticipates these general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as its pipeline of candidates grows and progresses to later phase clinical trials, in addition to inflationary pressure on goods and services and the labor market.

Other Income (Expense)
----------------------

Other income (expense) is primarily related to interest income and expense. Other expense increased $2.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same periods of 2022. The increase was primarily due to the non-cash interest expense on the liability related to the sale of future royalties.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
-------------------------------

The Company has historically financed its operations through the sale of its equity securities, revenue from its licensing and collaboration agreements, and the sale of certain future royalties. Research and development activities have required significant capital investment since the Company's inception and are expected to continue to require significant cash expenditure as the Company's pipeline continues to expand and matures into later stage clinical trials. Additionally, the Company expanded its facilities in Verona, Wisconsin and leased additional facilities in San Diego, California. Each of these expansions is designed to increase the Company's internal manufacturing and discovery capabilities and requires significant capital investment.

The Company's cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased to $58.2 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $110.9 million at September 30, 2023. Cash invested in available-for-sale debt securities was $162.1 million at December 31, 2023 compared to $292.7 million at September 30, 2023.

On December 2, 2022, the Company entered into the Open Market Sale Agreement, pursuant to which the Company may, from time to time, sell up to $250.0 million in shares of the Company's common stock through Jefferies LLC, acting as the sales agent and/or principal, in an at-the-market offering. As of December 31, 2023, no shares have been issued under the Open Market Sale Agreement.

On January 2, 2024, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with Jefferies LLC, BofA Securities, Inc., and Cowen and Company, LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters. The Company issued 15,790,000 shares of common stock at an offering price of $28.50 per share. The aggregate purchase price paid by investors was $450.0 million and the Company received net proceeds of $429.0 million after deducting advisory fees and offering expenses.

The Company believes its current financial resources are sufficient to fund its operations through at least the next twelve months.

The following table presents a summary of cash flows:

|  | Three Months Ended December 31, | Three Months Ended December 31, | Three Months Ended December 31, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |  |  |  |
| Cash Flow from: |  |  | $ |
| Operating activities |  | 64,839 |  |
| Financing activities |  | 267 |  |
| Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash |  | $ | $ |

During the three months ended December 31, 2023, cash flow used by operating activities was $117.8 million, which was primarily due to the ongoing expenses related to the Company's research and development programs and general and administrative expenses. Cash provided by investing activities was $64.8 million, which was primarily related to sales and maturities of investments of $133.5 million, offset by capital expenditures, $68.7 million of construction in progress. Cash provided by financing activities of $0.3 million was primarily related to cash received from stock option exercises.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
-------------------------------

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
------------------------------------------------

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on the foregoing, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the Company's most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
