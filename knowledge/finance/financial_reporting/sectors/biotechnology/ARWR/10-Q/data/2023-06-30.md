<h2>NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES</h2>
<h2>General and Recent Developments</h2>
<p>Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries (referred to herein collectively as the "Company") are primarily engaged in developing medicines that treat intractable diseases by silencing the genes that cause them. Using a broad portfolio of RNA chemistries and efficient modes of delivery, the Company's therapies trigger the RNA interference mechanism to induce rapid, deep and durable knockdown of target genes. RNA interference ("RNAi") is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene, thereby affecting the production of a specific protein. The Company's RNAi-based therapeutics may leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing to target and shut down specific disease-causing genes.</p>

<h2>Consolidation and Basis of Presentation</h2>
<p>The interim Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries (wholly-owned subsidiaries and a variable interest entity for which the Company is the primary beneficiary). Subsidiaries refer to Arrowhead Madison, Inc., Visirna Therapeutics, Inc. ("Visirna"), and Arrowhead Australia Pty Ltd. For subsidiaries in which the Company owns or is exposed to less than 100% of the economics, the Company records net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in its consolidated statements of operations equal to the percentage of the economic or ownership interests retained in such entity by the respective noncontrolling party.</p>
<p>The interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The financial data of the Company included herein are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all material adjustments of a normal recurring nature have been made to present fairly the Company's</p>
<p>financial position at June 30, 2023 and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.</p>
<p>Certain financial information that is normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, but that is not required for interim reporting purposes, has been omitted from the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements and related notes. Readers are urged to review the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022 for more complete descriptions and discussions. Operating results and cash flows for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2023.</p>
<h2>Liquidity</h2>
<p>The Company's primary sources of financing have been through the sale of its securities, revenue from its licensing and collaboration agreements and the sale of certain future royalties. Research and development activities have required significant capital investment since the Company's inception and are expected to continue to require significant cash expenditure in the future, particularly as the Company's pipeline of drug candidates and its headcount have both expanded significantly. Additionally, significant capital investment will be required as the Company's pipeline matures into later stage clinical trials and as the Company plans to increase its internal manufacturing capabilities.</p>
<p>At June 30, 2023, the Company had $105.3 million in cash and cash equivalents (including $7.3 million in restricted cash), $346.4 million in short-term investments and $42.8 million in long-term investments to fund operations. During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, the Company's cash and cash equivalents and investments balance increased by $12.2 million which was primarily due to the $250.0 million upfront payment received from Royalty Pharma (Note 11) and $110.0 million in milestone payments from the Company's collaboration and license agreements, partially offset by cash used to fund its operations.</p>
<p>In total, the Company is eligible to receive up to $3.4 billion in developmental, regulatory and sales milestones, and may receive various royalties on net sales from its licensing and collaboration agreements, subject to the terms and conditions of those agreements. The revenue recognition for these collaboration agreements is discussed further in Note 2.</p>

<h2>Glaxosmithkline Intellectual Property (No. 3) Limited ("GSK")</h2>
<p>On November 22, 2021, GSK and the Company entered into an Exclusive License Agreement (the "GSK License Agreement"). Under the GSK License Agreement, GSK has received an exclusive license for GSK-4532990 (formerly ARO-HSD). The exclusive license is worldwide with the exception of greater China. The Company completed its Phase 1/2 study of GSK-4532990, and GSK is wholly responsible for all clinical development and commercialization of GSK-4532990 in its territory. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company has received an upfront payment of $120.0 million and recognized an additional $30.0 million at the start of a Phase 2 trial. The Company is also eligible for an additional payment of $100.0 million upon achieving a successful Phase 2 trial readout and the first patient dosed in a Phase 3 trial. Furthermore, should the Phase 3 trial read out positively, and the potential new medicine receives regulatory approval in major markets, the deal provides for commercial milestone payments to the Company of up to $190.0 million at first commercial sale, and up to $590.0 million in sales-related milestone payments. The Company is further eligible to receive tiered royalties on net product sales in a range of mid-teens to twenty percent.</p>
<p>At the inception of the GSK License Agreement, the Company identified one distinct performance obligation. The Company determined that the key deliverables included the license and certain R&amp;D services, including the Company's responsibility to complete the Phase 1/2 study (the "GSK R&amp;D Services"). Due to the specialized and unique nature of the GSK R&amp;D Services and their direct relationship with the license, the Company determined that these deliverables represented one distinct bundle and, thus, one performance obligation. Beyond the GSK R&amp;D Services, which are the responsibility of the Company, GSK will be responsible for managing future clinical development and commercialization in its territory.</p>
<p>The Company determined the initial transaction price totaled $120.0 million, including the upfront payment, which was collected in January 2022. The Company has excluded any future estimated milestones or royalties from this transaction price to date. The Company has allocated the total $120.0 million initial transaction price to its one distinct performance obligation for the GSK-4532990 license and the associated GSK R&amp;D Services. As the Company has completed its performance obligation related to this agreement, the upfront payment of $120.0 million was fully recognized during the six months ended March 31, 2022. Further, GSK dosed the first patient in a Phase 2 trial in March 2023, triggering a $30.0 million milestone payment to the Company which was paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. There wereno contract assets and liabilities recorded as of June 30, 2023.</p>
<h2>Horizon Therapeutics Ireland DAC ("Horizon")</h2>
<p>On June 18, 2021, Horizon and the Company entered into a collaboration and license agreement (the "Horizon License Agreement"). Under the terms of the Horizon License Agreement, Horizon received a worldwide exclusive license for HZN-457, a clinical-stage medicine being developed by Horizon as a potential treatment for people with uncontrolled gout. The Company conducted all activities through the preclinical stages of development of, and Horizon is now wholly responsible for clinical development and commercialization of, HZN-457. The Company received $40.0 million as an upfront payment in July 2021 and an additional $15.0 million upon Horizon's initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial in January 2023, and is eligible to receive up to $645.0 million in additional potential development, regulatory and sales milestones. The Company is also eligible to receive royalties in the low- to mid-teens range on net product sales.</p>
<p>At the inception of the Horizon License Agreement, the Company identified one distinct performance obligation. The Company determined that the key deliverables included the license and certain R&amp;D services, including the Company's responsibilities to conduct all activities through the preclinical stages of development of HZN-457 (the "Horizon R&amp;D Services"). Due to the specialized and unique nature of these Horizon R&amp;D Services and their direct relationship with the license, the Company determined that these deliverables represented one distinct bundle and, thus,one performance obligation. Beyond the Horizon R&amp;D Services, which are the responsibility of the Company, Horizon is responsible for managing future clinical development and commercialization of HZN-457.</p>
<p>The Company determined the initial transaction price totaled $40.0 million, including the upfront payment. The Company has excluded any future estimated milestones or royalties from this transaction price to date. The Company allocated the total $40.0 million initial transaction price to itsone distinct performance obligation for the HZN457 license and the associated Horizon R&amp;D Services. Revenue was recognized on a straight-line basis over the timeframe for</p>
<p>completing the Horizon R&amp;D Services. The Company determined that the straight-line basis was appropriate as its efforts were expended evenly over the course of completing its performance obligation. Further, Horizon enrolled the first subject in December 2022 in a Phase 1 randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of HZN-457, triggering a $15.0 million milestone payment to the Company which was paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. There was $1.5 million in contract assets recorded as accounts receivable and $0 contract liabilities as of June 30, 2023.</p>
<h2>Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited ("Takeda")</h2>
<p>On October 7, 2020, Takeda and the Company entered into an Exclusive License and Co-Funding Agreement (the "Takeda License Agreement"). Under the Takeda License Agreement, Takeda and the Company will co-develop its Fazirsiran program, the Company's second-generation subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic candidate being developed as a treatment for liver disease associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Within the United States, Fazirsiran, if approved, will be cocommercialized under a 50/50 profit sharing structure. Outside the United States, Takeda will lead the global commercialization strategy and received an exclusive license to commercialize Fazirsiran, while the Company will be eligible to receive tiered royalties of 20% to 25% on net sales. The Company received $300.0 million as an upfront payment in January 2021, recognized an additional $40.0 million upon Takeda's initiation of a Phase 3 clinical study in March 2023, and is eligible to receive potential development, regulatory and commercial milestones of up to $527.5 million.</p>
<p>At the inception of the Takeda License Agreement, the Company identified one distinct performance obligation. The Company determined that the key deliverables included the license and certain R&amp;D services including the Company's responsibilities to complete the initial portion of the SEQUOIA study, to complete the ongoing Phase 2 AROAAT2002 study and to ensure certain manufacturing of Fazirsiran drug product is completed and delivered to Takeda (the "Takeda R&amp;D Services"). Due to the specialized and unique nature of these Takeda R&amp;D Services and their direct relationship with the license, the Company determined that these deliverables represent one distinct bundle and, thus, one performance obligation. Beyond the Takeda R&amp;D Services, which are the responsibility of the Company, Takeda will be responsible for managing future clinical development and commercialization outside the United States. Within the United States, the Company will also participate in co-development and cocommercialization efforts and will co-fund these efforts with Takeda as part of the 50/50 profit sharing structure within the United States. The Company considers the collaborative activities, including the co-development and co-commercialization, to be a separate unit of account within Topic 808, and as such, these co-funding amounts are recorded as research and development expenses or general and administrative expenses, as appropriate.</p>
<p>The Company has allocated the total $300.0 million initial transaction price to its one distinct performance obligation for the Fazirsiran license and the associated Takeda R&amp;D Services. Revenue is recognized using a proportional performance method (based on actual patient visits completed versus total estimated visits completed for the ongoing SEQUOIA and AROAAT2002 clinical studies). The Company previously expected these clinical trials to extend to September 2025 in order to demonstrate long term safety and efficacy in the open label extension (OLE) part of the studies; however, Takeda now intends to initiate a new OLE study available to patients participating in these Phase 2 studies that will initiate as early as the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Based on this new information, patients enrolled in the SEQUOIA and AROAAT2002 studies are expected to complete their Phase 2 study visits between June 2023 and June 2024, shortening the Company's performance obligation. As a result, effective the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company changed its estimates of the revenue recognition to better reflect this newly estimated performance period. The effect of these changes in estimates resulted in accelerated revenue by $61.4 million, or $0.58 per share (diluted) for each of the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023. There were $16.9 million of contract liabilities recorded as deferred revenue, of which $16.9 million was classified as current as of June 30, 2023.</p>
<p>In March 2023, Takeda dosed the first patient in the Phase 3 REDWOOD clinical study of Fazirsiran, triggering a $40.0 million milestone payment to the Company which was paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The Company also recorded $1.4 million as accrued expenses as of June 30, 2023 that was primarily driven by codevelopment and co-commercialization activities.</p>
<h2>Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Janssen")</h2>
<p>On October 3, 2018, Janssen, part of the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson, and the Company entered into a License Agreement (the "Janssen License Agreement") and the Janssen Collaboration Agreement. The Company also entered into a stock purchase agreement with JJDC, Inc. ("JJDC"), Johnson &amp; Johnson's venture capital arm (the "JJDC Stock Purchase Agreement").</p>
<p>Under the Janssen License Agreement, Janssen received a worldwide, exclusive license to the Company's JNJ-3989 (ARO-HBV) program, the Company's thirdgeneration subcutaneously administered RNAi therapeutic candidate being</p>
<p>developed as a potential therapy for patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection. Beyond the Company's Phase 1/2 study of JNJ-3989 (ARO-HBV), which the Company was responsible for completing, Janssen is wholly responsible for clinical development and commercialization of JNJ-3989 (ARO-HBV). Under the terms of the Janssen License Agreement, the Company has received $175.0 million as an upfront payment, $75.0 million in the form of an equity investment by JJDC in the Company's common stock under the JJDC Stock Purchase Agreement, and milestone and option payments totaling $73.0 million, and the Company may receive up to $0.8 billion in development and sales milestone payments for the Janssen License Agreement. The Company is further eligible to receive tiered royalties on product sales up to mid-teens under the Janssen License Agreement.</p>
<p>In May 2021, Janssen exercised its option right for JNJ-75220795 (ARO-JNJ1) which resulted in a $10.0 million milestone payment to the Company. This $10.0 million milestone payment was recognized entirely as of September 30, 2021. The Company conducted its discovery, optimization and preclinical research and development of JNJ-75220795 (ARO-JNJ1), ARO-JNJ2, and ARO-JNJ3 under the Janssen Collaboration Agreement. All costs and labor hours spent by the Company have been entirely funded by Janssen. On April 7, 2023, Janssen voluntarily terminated the Janssen Collaboration Agreement. Upon termination, the Company regained full rights to ARO-PNPLA3, formerly called JNJ-75220795, the only candidate for which Janssen had exercised its option.</p>
<p>At the inception of the Janssen License Agreement, the Company determined that the key deliverables included the license and certain R&amp;D services including the Company's responsibility to complete the Phase 1/2 study of JNJ-3989 (ARO-HBV) and the Company's responsibility to ensure certain manufacturing of JNJ-3989 (AROHBV) drug product is completed and delivered to Janssen (the "Janssen R&amp;D Services"). Due to the specialized and unique nature of these Janssen R&amp;D Services and their direct relationship with the license, the Company determined that these deliverables represent one distinct bundle and, thus, one performance obligation.</p>
<p>The Company determined the transaction price totaled approximately $252.7 million, which includes the upfront payment, the premium paid by JJDC for its equity investment in the Company, two $25.0 million milestone payments related to JNJ-3989 (ARO-HBV), and estimated payments for reimbursable Janssen R&amp;D Services to be performed. The Company has allocated the total $252.7 million initial transaction price to its one distinct performance obligation for the JNJ-3989 (ARO-HBV) license and the associated Janssen R&amp;D Services. The Company recognized this transaction price in its entirety as of September 30, 2021, as its performance obligations were substantially completed. Future milestones and royalties achieved will be recognized in their entirety when earned. There were no contract assets and liabilities recorded as of June 30, 2023.</p>
<h2>Amgen Inc. ("Amgen")</h2>
<p>On September 28, 2016, Amgen and the Company entered into two collaboration and license agreements and a common stock purchase agreement. Under the Second Collaboration and License Agreement (the "Olpasiran Agreement"), Amgen received a worldwide, exclusive license to the Company's novel RNAi Olpasiran program. These RNAi molecules are designed to reduce elevated lipoprotein(a), which is a genetically validated, independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Under the first collaboration and license agreement (the "First Collaboration and License Agreement" or the "ARO-AMG1 Agreement"), Amgen received an option to a worldwide, exclusive license to ARO-AMG1, an RNAi therapy for an undisclosed genetically validated cardiovascular target. Under both agreements, Amgen is wholly responsible for clinical development and commercialization.</p>
<p>Under the Olpasiran Agreement and the ARO-AMG1 Agreement, the Company has received $35.0 million in upfront payments and $21.5 million in the form of an equity investment by Amgen in the Company's common stock. Further, the Company received additional an $ 55.0 million in milestone payments; $10.0 million upon Amgen's initiation of Phase 1 study in September 2018, $20.0 million upon its initiation of a Phase 2 clinical study in July 2020, and $25.0 million upon its first subject enrollment in a Phase 3 trial in December 2022. The Company has substantially completed its performance obligations under the Olpasiran Agreement and the ARO-AMG1 Agreement. There were no contract assets and liabilities recorded as of June 30, 2023.</p>
<p>In November 2022, Royalty Pharma and the Company entered into the Royalty Pharma Agreement. In consideration for the payments under the Royalty Pharma Agreement, Royalty Pharma is entitled to receive all royalties otherwise payable by Amgen to the Company under the Olpasiran Agreement. The Company remains eligible to receive up to an additional $535.0 million in remaining development, regulatory and sales milestone payments payable from Amgen and Royalty Pharma. See Note 11.</p>

Pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement (the "Visirna SPA") entered into simultaneously with the Visirna License Agreement, the Company acquired a majority stake in Visirna as partial consideration for the Visirna License Agreement. Under the Visirna SPA, entities affiliated with Vivo Capital also acquired a minority stake in Visirna in exchange for $60.0 million in upfront capital to support the operations of Visirna. As further consideration under the Visirna License Agreement, the Company is also eligible to receive potential royalties on commercial sales.</p>
<p>During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, the Company performed manufacturing and development work pursuant to a Clinical Supply Agreement between the parties contemplated by the Visirna License Agreement.

<h2>NOTE 9. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION</h2>
<p>The Company has three plans that provide for equity-based compensation. Under the 2004 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2004 Plan") and 2013 Incentive Plan (the "2013 Plan"), 68,555 and 3,440,076 shares, respectively, of the Company's common stock are reserved for grants of stock options and restricted stock awards to employees and directors as of June 30, 2023.</p>
<p>On March 18, 2021, the Company's Board of Directors approved the Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 2021 Incentive Plan (the "2021 Plan"), which authorized 8,000,000 shares (subject to certain adjustments) available for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted and unrestricted stock, performance awards, cash awards and other awards convertible into or otherwise based on shares of the Company's common stock. The maximum number of shares authorized under the 2021 Plan will be (i) reduced by any shares subject to awards made under the 2013 Plan after January 1, 2021, and (ii) increased by any shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2013 Plan as of January 1, 2021 that, after January 1, 2021, are canceled, expired, forfeited or otherwise not issued under such awards (other than as a result of being tendered or withheld to pay the exercise price or withholding taxes in connection with any such awards) or settled in cash. As of June 30, 2023, the total number of shares reserved for issuance was 6,186,644 shares, which included 197,596 shares that were forfeited under the 2013 Plan, and1,977,114 shares have been granted under the 2021 Plan.</p>
<p>In addition, there were 712,454 shares reserved for options and746,175 shares reserved for restricted stock units issued as inducement grants to new employees granted outside of the Company's equity-based compensation plans under Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules.</p>

<p>The aggregate intrinsic values represents the amount by which the market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised during the three months ended June 30, 2023 and</p>
<p>2022 was $6.5 million and $1.6 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised during the nine months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 was $10.1 million and $24.9 million, respectively.</p>
<p>Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options outstanding for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, was $2.1 million and $2.6 million, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 was $6.7 million and $8.3 million, respectively.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2023, the pre-tax compensation expense for all outstanding unvested stock options in the amount of $5.3 million will be recognized in the Company's results of operations over a weighted average period of 12 months.</p>
<p>The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which do not have vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. The determination of the fair value of each stock option is affected by the Company's stock price on the date of grant, as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. Because the Company's employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.</p>
<p>The following table provides the assumptions used in the calculation of grant-date fair values of these stock options based on the Back-Scholes option pricing model:</p>

<h2>Restricted Stock Units</h2>
<p>Restricted stock units ("RSUs"), including market-based, time-based and performance-based awards, have been granted under the Company's 2013 and 2021 Plans and as inducements grants granted outside of the Company's equity-based compensation plans. At vesting, each outstanding RSU will be exchanged for one share of the Company's common stock. RSU awards generally vest subject to the satisfaction of service requirements or the satisfaction of both service requirements and achievement of certain performance targets.</p>

<p>The fair value of RSUs was determined based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the grant date, with consideration given to the probability of achieving service and/or performance conditions for awards.</p>
<p>For the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded $17.8 million and $33.7 million of expense</p>
<p>related to RSUs, respectively. For the nine months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded $53.2 million and $83.4 million of expense related to RSUs, respectively. As of June 30, 2023, there was $131.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs that is expected to be recognized over a weightedaverage period of 2.3 years.</p>
<h2>NOTE 10. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS</h2>
<p>The Company employs a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date using the exit price. Accordingly, when market observable data are not readily available, the Company's own assumptions are used to reflect those that market participants would be presumed to use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.</p>
<p>Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based on the level of judgment associated with inputs used to measure their fair values and the level of market price observability, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.</li>
<li>Level 2 Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are based on the following:</li>
<li>ยท Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;</li>
<li>ยท Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets; or</li>
<li>ยท Either directly or indirectly observable inputs as of the reporting date.</li>
<li>Level 3 Pricing inputs are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement, and the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.</li>
</ul>
<p>In certain cases, inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Thus, a Level 3 fair value measurement may include inputs that are observable (Level 1 or Level 2) and unobservable (Level 3). The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and consideration of factors specific to the asset or liability.</p>
<p>The Company uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including during periods of market disruption. In periods of market disruption, the ability to observe prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2, or from Level 2 to Level 3. The Company recognizes transfers between levels at either the actual date of the event or a change in circumstances that caused the transfer. At June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the Company did not have any financial assets or financial liabilities based on Level 3 measurements.</p>
<p>The following table presents information about the Company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company:</p>

<h2>NOTE 11. LIABILITY RELATED TO THE SALE OF FUTURE ROYALTIES</h2>
<p>On November 9, 2022, the Company and Royalty Pharma entered into the Royalty Pharma Agreement, pursuant to which Royalty Pharma agreed to pay up to $410.0 million in cash to the Company in consideration for the Company's future royalty interest in Olpasiran, a small interfering RNA (siRNA) originally developed by the Company and licensed to Amgen in 2016 under the Olpasiran Agreement.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the Royalty Pharma Agreement, Royalty Pharma paid $250.0 million upfront and agreed to pay up to an additional $160.0 million in aggregate one-time milestone payments due if and when the following milestone events occur: (i) $50.0 million on completion of enrollment in the OCEAN Phase 3 clinical trial for Olpasiran, (ii) $50.0 million upon receipt of FDA approval of Olpasiran for an approved indication (reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction, urgent coronary revascularization, or coronary heart disease death in adults with established cardiovascular disease and elevated Lp(a)), and (iii) $60.0 million upon Royalty Pharma's receipt of at least $70.0 million of royalty payments under the Royalty Pharma Agreement in any single calendar year.</p>
<p>In consideration for the payment of the foregoing amounts under the Royalty Pharma Agreement, Royalty Pharma is entitled to receive all royalties otherwise payable by Amgen to the Company under the Olpasiran Agreement. The Company remains eligible to receive any milestone payments potentially payable by Amgen under the Olpasiran Agreement.</p>
<p>The Company has evaluated the terms of the Royalty Pharma Agreement and concluded in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance that the Company accounted for the transaction as debt and the funding of $250.0 million from Royalty Pharma was recorded as a liability related to the sale of future royalties on its consolidated balance sheets. The Company is not obligated to repay this upfront funding received under the Royalty Pharma Agreement. This liability is amortized over the expected repayment term using an effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is calculated based on the rate that would enable the debt to be repaid in full over the anticipated life of the arrangement. The interest rate may vary during the term of the agreement depending on a number of factors, including the amount and timing of forecasted net revenues which affects the repayment timing and ultimate amount of repayment. The Company will evaluate the effective interest rate periodically based on its current revenue forecasts utilizing the prospective method. For the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recognized non-cash interest expense of $5.2 million and $13.1 million, respectively, on the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.</p>

<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>The Company develops medicines that treat intractable diseases by silencing the genes that cause them. Using a broad portfolio of RNA chemistries and efficient modes of delivery, the Company's therapies trigger the RNAi mechanism to induce rapid, deep and durable knockdown of target genes. RNAi is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene, thereby affecting the production of a specific protein. RNAi-based therapeutics may leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing to target and shut down specific disease-causing genes.</p>
<p>The Company has focused its resources on therapeutics that exclusively utilize its high levels of pharmacologic activity in multiple animal models spanning several therapeutic areas. The Company believes that TRiM enabled therapeutics offer several potential advantages over prior generation and competing technologies, including: simplified manufacturing and reduced costs; multiple routes of administration including subcutaneous injection and inhaled administration; the ability to target multiple tissue types including liver, lung, muscle, CNS and others; and the potential for improved safety and reduced risk of intracellular buildup, because there are fewer metabolites from smaller, simpler molecules. TM</p>
<p>The Company's pipeline includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>ยท Hypertriglyceridemia - ARO-APOC3</li>
<li>ยท Dyslipidemia - ARO-ANG3</li>
<li>
<p>ยท Cardiovascular disease - Olpasiran (formerly AMG 890 or ARO-LPA, out-licensed to Amgen)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ยท Cystic fibrosis - ARO-ENAC2</p>
</li>
<li>ยท Muco-obstructive or inflammatory pulmonary conditions - ARO-MUC5AC and ARO-RAGE</li>
<li>ยท Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis - ARO-MMP7</li>
<li>ยท Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) - GSK-4532990 (formerly ARO-HSD, out-licensed to GSK)</li>
<li>ยท Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) - Fazirsiran (formerly ARO-AAT, a collaboration with Takeda)</li>
<li>ยท Chronic hepatitis B virus - JNJ-3989 (formerly ARO-HBV, out-licensed to Janssen)</li>
<li>ยท Uncontrolled gout - HZN-457 (formerly ARO-XDH, out-licensed to Horizon)</li>
<li>ยท Complement mediated diseases - ARO-C3</li>
<li>ยท Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) - ARO-PNPLA3 (formerly JNJ-75220795 or ARO-JNJ1)</li>
<li>ยท Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy - ARO-DUX4</li>
<li>ยท Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis "ALS" (CNS) - ARO-SOD1</li>
</ul>
<p>The Company operates lab facilities in San Diego, California and Madison, Wisconsin, where its research and development activities, including the development of RNAi therapeutics, take place. The Company's principal executive offices are located in Pasadena, California.</p>
<p>The Company continues to develop other clinical candidates for future clinical trials. Clinical candidates are tested internally and through GLP toxicology studies at outside laboratories. Drug materials for such studies and clinical trials are either manufactured internally or contracted to third-party manufacturers. The Company engages third-party contract research organizations (CROs) to manage clinical trials and works cooperatively with such organizations on all aspects of clinical trial management, including plan design, patient recruiting, and follow up. These outside costs, relating to the preparation for and administration of clinical trials, are referred to as "candidate costs." As clinical candidates progress through clinical development, candidate costs will increase.</p>
<h2>The First Three Quarters of Fiscal 2023 Business Highlights</h2>
<p>Key recent developments during the first three quarters of fiscal 2023 included the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>ยท hosted a Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) Day on June 1, 2023 to discuss progress of the Company's pipeline of RNAi Therapeutics, at which the following updates were discussed:</li>

<p>Net loss was $102.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to $72.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022. Net loss was $95.6 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to $90.6 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2022. Net loss per share - diluted was $0.96 for the three months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to $0.68 for the three months ended June 30, 2022. Net loss per share - diluted was $0.90 for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 as compared to $0.86 for the nine months ended June 30, 2022.</p>
<p>The changes in net loss for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023 reflect an increase in research and development expenses, which have continued to increase as the Company's pipeline of candidates has expanded and progressed through clinical trial phases.</p>

<h2>Revenue</h2>
<p>Total revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2023 decreased to $15.8 million, or 51.2% from the same period of 2022. Total revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 increased to $224.6 million, or 6.1% from the same period of 2022. The changes were primarily driven by the revenue recognition associated with GSK, Horizon, Takeda and Amgen license agreements, as discussed below. The Company has evaluated each agreement in accordance with FASB Topic 808Collaborative Arrangements and Topic 606Revenue for Contracts from Customers . See Note 2 - Collaboration and License Agreements to Consolidated Financial Statements of Part I, "Item 1. Financial Statements" for more information on revenue recognized under the collaboration and license agreements.</p>
<h2>GSK</h2>
<p>At the inception of the GSK License Agreement, the Company identified one distinct performance obligation. The Company determined that the key deliverables included the license and certain R&amp;D services, including the Company's responsibility to complete the Phase 1/2 study (the "GSK R&amp;D Services"). Due to the specialized and unique nature of the GSK R&amp;D Services and their direct relationship with the license, the Company determined that these deliverables represented one distinct bundle and, thus, one performance obligation. Beyond the GSK R&amp;D Services, which are the responsibility of the Company, GSK will be responsible for managing future clinical development and commercialization in its territory.</p>
<p>The Company determined the initial transaction price totaled $120.0 million, including the upfront payment, which was collected in January 2022 (see Note 2 Collaboration and License Agreements to Consolidated Financial Statements of Part I, "Item 1. Financial Statements" for more information on revenue recognized under the GSK License Agreement). The Company has excluded any future estimated milestones or royalties from this transaction price to date. The Company has allocated the total $120.0 million initial transaction price to its one distinct performance obligation for the GSK-4532990 license and the associated GSK R&amp;D Services. As the Company has completed its performance obligation related to this agreement, the upfront payment of $120.0 million was fully recognized during the six months ended March 31, 2022. Further, GSK dosed the first patient in a Phase 2b trial in March 2023, triggering a $30.0 million milestone payment to the Company which was paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.</p>
<h2>Horizon</h2>
<p>On June 18, 2021, Horizon and the Company entered into the Horizon License Agreement. At the inception of the Horizon License Agreement, the Company identified one distinct performance obligation. The Company determined that the key deliverables included the license and certain R&amp;D services, including the Company's responsibilities to conduct all activities through the preclinical stages of development of HZN-457 (the "Horizon R&amp;D Services"). Due to the specialized and unique nature of these Horizon R&amp;D Services and their direct relationship with the license, the Company determined that these deliverables represented one distinct bundle and, thus, one performance obligation. Beyond the Horizon R&amp;D Services, which are the responsibility of the Company, Horizon is responsible for managing future clinical development and commercialization of HZN-457.</p>
<p>The Company determined the initial transaction price totaled $40.0 million, including the upfront payment (see Note 2 - Collaboration and License Agreements to Consolidated Financial Statements of Part I, "Item 1. Financial Statements" for more information on revenue recognized under the Horizon License Agreement). The Company has excluded any future estimated milestones or royalties from this transaction price to date. The Company allocated the total $40.0 million initial transaction price to its one distinct performance obligation for the HZN-457 license and the associated Horizon R&amp;D Services. Revenue was recognized on a straight-line basis over the timeframe for completing the Horizon R&amp;D Services. The Company determined that the straight-line basis was appropriate as its efforts were expended evenly over the course of completing its performance obligation. Further, Horizon enrolled the first subject in December 2022 in a Phase 1</p>
<p>randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of HZN-457, triggering a $15.0 million milestone payment to the Company which was paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.</p>
<h2>Takeda</h2>
<p>On October 7, 2020, Takeda and the Company entered into the Takeda License Agreement. At the inception of the Takeda License Agreement, the Company identified one distinct performance obligation. The Company determined that the key deliverables included the license and certain R&amp;D services including the Company's responsibilities to complete the initial portion of the SEQUOIA study, to complete the ongoing Phase 2 AROAAT2002 study and to ensure certain manufacturing of Fazirsiran drug product is completed and delivered to Takeda (the "Takeda R&amp;D Services"). Due to the specialized and unique nature of these Takeda R&amp;D Services and their direct relationship with the license, the Company determined that these deliverables represent one distinct bundle and, thus, one performance obligation. Beyond the Takeda R&amp;D Services, which are the responsibility of the Company, Takeda will be responsible for managing future clinical development and commercialization outside the United States. Within the United States, the Company will also participate in co-development and co-commercialization efforts and will co-fund these efforts with Takeda as part of the 50/50 profit sharing structure within the United States. The Company considers the collaborative activities, including the co-development and co-commercialization, to be a separate unit of account within Topic 808, and as such, these co-funding amounts are recorded as research and development expenses or general and administrative expenses, as appropriate.</p>
<p>The Company has allocated the total $300.0 million initial transaction price to its one distinct performance obligation for the Fazirsiran license and the associated Takeda R&amp;D Services. Revenue is recognized using a proportional performance method (based on actual patient visits completed versus total estimated visits for the ongoing SEQUOIA and AROAAT2002 clinical studies). See Note 2 - Collaboration and License Agreements to Consolidated Financial Statements of Part I, "Item 1. Financial Statements" for more information on revenue recognized under the Takeda License Agreement. The Company previously expected these clinical trials to extend to September 2025 in order to demonstrate long term safety and efficacy in the open label extension (OLE) part of the studies; however, Takeda now intends to initiate a new OLE study available to patients participating in these Phase 2 studies that initiated in July 2023. Based on this new information, patients enrolled in the SEQUOIA and AROAAT2002 studies are expected to complete their Phase 2 study visits between June 2023 and June 2024, shortening the Company's performance obligation. As a result, effective the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company changed its estimates of the revenue recognition to better reflect these newly estimated proportional performance periods. The effect of these changes in estimates resulted in accelerated revenue by $61.4 million, or $0.58 per share (diluted) for each of the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023. There were $16.9 million of contract liabilities recorded as deferred revenue, which was classified as current as of June 30, 2023.</p>
<p>In March 2023, Takeda dosed the first patient in the Phase 3 REDWOOD clinical study of Fazirsiran, triggering a $40.0 million milestone payment to the Company which was paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.</p>
<h2>Amgen Inc. ("Amgen")</h2>
<p>On September 28, 2016, Amgen and the Company entered into two collaboration and license agreements and a common stock purchase agreement. Under the Olpasiran Agreement, Amgen received a worldwide, exclusive license to the Company's novel RNAi Olpasiran program. Olpasiran is designed to reduce elevated lipoprotein(a), which is a genetically validated, independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Amgen is wholly responsible for clinical development and commercialization. The Company has substantially completed its performance obligations under the Olpasiran Agreement.</p>
<p>Further, in November 2022, Royalty Pharma and the Company entered into the Royalty Pharma Agreement. In consideration for the payments under the Royalty Pharma Agreement, Royalty Pharma is entitled to receive all royalties otherwise payable by Amgen to the Company under the Olpasiran Agreement. The Company remains eligible to receive any milestone payments potentially payable by Amgen under the Olpasiran Agreement.</p>
<p>In December 2022, Amgen enrolled the first subject in its Phase 3 trial of Olpasiran, which triggered a $25.0 million milestone payment to the Company which was paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The Company is further eligible to receive up to an additional $535.0 million in aggregate development, regulatory, and sales milestone payments from Amgen and Royalty Pharma.</p>
<h2>Operating Expenses</h2>
<p>The analysis below details the operating expenses and discusses the expenditures of the Company within the major expense categories. For purposes of comparison, the amounts for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 are shown in the tables below.</p>
<h2>Research and Development (R&amp;D) Expenses</h2>
<p>R&amp;D expenses are related to the Company's research and development discovery efforts and related candidate costs, which are comprised primarily of outsourced costs related to the manufacturing of clinical supplies, toxicity/efficacy studies and clinical trial expenses. Internal costs primarily relate to discovery operations at the Company's research facilities in San Diego, California and Madison, Wisconsin, including facility costs and laboratory-related expenses. The Company does not separately track R&amp;D expenses by individual research and development projects, or by individual drug candidates. The Company operates in a cross-functional manner across projects and does not separately allocate facilities-related costs, candidate costs, discovery costs, compensation expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses, and other expenses related to research and development activities.</p>

<p>Candidate costs increased $9.5 million, or 30%, for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and $8.3 million, or 8%, for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022. This increase was primarily due to the additional progression of the Company's pipeline of candidates into and through clinical trials, which resulted in higher outsourced clinical trial, toxicity study and manufacturing costs.</p>
<p>R&amp;D discovery costs increased $5.2 million, or 34%, for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and $10.0 million, or 25%, for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022. This increase was due to the growth of the Company's discovery efforts and continued advancement into novel therapeutic areas and tissue types.</p>
<p>Salaries and stock compensation expense consist of salary, bonuses, payroll taxes, related benefits and stock compensation for the Company's R&amp;D personnel. The increases in salaries and stock comp expenses for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 were primarily due to an increase in R&amp;D headcount that has occurred as the Company has expanded its pipeline of candidates, in addition to annual salary increases. Stock compensation expense was based upon the valuation of</p>
<p>stock options and restricted stock units granted to employees and directors.</p>
<p>Facilities-related expense included lease costs for the Company's research and development facilities in San Diego, California and Madison, Wisconsin. Facilitiesrelated costs increased $1.0 million, or 26%, for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and $4.0 million, or 52%, for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022. This increase was mainly due to the additional lease expense as the Company expands discovery efforts to identify new drug candidates.</p>
<p>Depreciation and amortization expense, a non-cash expense, relates to depreciation on lab equipment and leasehold improvements at the facilities.</p>
<p>The Company anticipates these R&amp;D expenses to continue to increase as its pipeline of candidates grows and progresses to later phase clinical trials, in addition to inflationary pressure on goods and services and the labor market.</p>

<p>Salaries expense increased $1.9 million, or 59%, for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and $3.9 million, or 38%, for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022. The increase was driven by the combination of annual salary increases and increased headcount required to support the Company's growth.</p>
<p>Professional, outside services, and other expense includes legal, consulting, patent expenses, business insurance expenses, other outside services, travel, communication and technology expenses. This expense increased $2.4 million, or 68%, for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and $4.3 million, or 39%, for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same period of 2022. The increase was mainly due to consulting expenses related to software implementation and administrative expenses in support of additional headcount.</p>
<p>Facilities related expense primarily includes rental costs and other facilities-related costs for the Company's corporate headquarters in Pasadena, California. Depreciation and amortization expense, a noncash expense, was primarily related to amortization of leasehold improvements for the Company's corporate headquarters.</p>
<p>Stock compensation expense, a non-cash expense, decreased by $14.3 million, or 57%, for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and $33.9 million, or 50%, for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same periods of 2022. The decrease was mainly due to the lower amount of recognized compensation costs and the reversal of recognized compensation costs related to a performance award where the minimum performance goal was not met. The fair value of</p>
<p>market condition-based awards was expensed ratably over the service period and was not adjusted for actual achievement.</p>
<p>Other than with respect to the stock compensation costs described above, the Company anticipates these general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as its pipeline of candidates grows and progresses to later phase clinical trials, in addition to inflationary pressure on goods and services and the labor market.</p>
<h2>Other Income (Loss)</h2>
<p>Other income (loss) is primarily related to interest income and expense. Other income decreased $1.5 million and $5.0 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, respectively, compared to the same periods of 2022. The decrease was primarily due to the interest expense on the liability related to the sale of future royalties, offset by higher yields on investments due to increased interest rates as well as various credits the Company received during the first three quarters of fiscal 2023.</p>
<h2>LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES</h2>
<p>The Company has historically financed its operations through the sale of its equity securities, revenue from its licensing and collaboration agreements, and the sale of certain future royalties. Research and development activities have required significant capital investment since the Company's inception and are expected to continue to require significant cash expenditure as the Company's pipeline continues to expand and matures into later stage clinical trials. Additionally, the Company expanded its facilities in Verona, Wisconsin and commenced the lease agreement for additional facilities in San Diego, California. Each of these expansions is designed to increase the Company's internal manufacturing and discovery capabilities, and each will require significant capital investment.</p>
<p>The Company's cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased to $105.3 million at June 30, 2023 compared to $108.0 million at September 30, 2022. Cash invested in short-term fixed income securities was $346.4 million at June 30, 2023 compared to $268.4 million at September 30, 2022. Cash invested in long-term fixed income securities was $42.8 million at June 30, 2023, compared to $105.9 million at September 30, 2022. On December 2, 2022, the Company entered into the Open Market Sale Agreement, pursuant to which the Company may, from time to time, sell up to $250.0 million in shares of the Company's common stock through Jefferies LLC, acting as the sales agent and/or principal, in an at-the-market offering. As of June 30, 2023, no shares have been issued under the Open Market Sale Agreement. The Company believes its current financial resources are sufficient to fund its operations through at least the next twelve months.</p>
