<h2>NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES</h2>
<h2>General and Recent Developments</h2>
<p>Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries (referred to herein collectively as the "Company") are primarily engaged in developing medicines that treat intractable diseases by silencing the genes that cause them. Using a broad portfolio of RNA chemistries and efficient modes of delivery, the Company's therapies trigger the RNA interference mechanism to induce rapid, deep and durable knockdown of target genes. RNA interference ("RNAi") is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene, thereby affecting the production of a specific protein. The Company's RNAi-based therapeutics may leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing to target and shut down specific disease-causing genes.</p>
<p>The following table presents the Company's current pipeline:</p>
<p>| Therapeutic Area | Name | Stage | Product Rights |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cardiometabolic | plozasiran (ARO-APOC3) | Phase 3 | Arrowhead |
| | zodasiran (ARO-ANG3) | Phase 2b | Arrowhead |
| | olpasiran | Phase 3 | Amgen |
| Pulmonary | ARO-RAGE | Phase 1/2a | Arrowhead |
| | ARO-MUC5AC | Phase 1/2a | Arrowhead |
| | ARO-MMP7 | Phase 1/2a | Arrowhead |
| Liver | GSK-4532990 | Phase 2b | GSK |
| | fazirsiran | Phase 3 | Takeda and Arrowhead |
| | daplusiran/tomligisiran (GSK5637608, formerly JNJ-3989) | Phase 2 | GSK |
| | ARO-PNPLA3 | Phase 1 | Arrowhead |
| | ARO-C3 | Phase 1/2a | Arrowhead |
| | ARO-CFB | Phase 1/2a | Arrowhead |
| Muscle | ARO-DUX4 | Phase 1/2a | Arrowhead |
| | ARO-DM1 | Phase 1/2a | Arrowhead |
| Central Nervous System (CNS) | Various | Pre-Clinical | Arrowhead |</p>
<p>The Company operates lab facilities in California and Wisconsin, where its research and development activities, including the development of RNAi therapeutics, take place. The Company's principal executive offices are located in Pasadena, California.</p>
<p>Thus far in fiscal 2024, the Company has continued to develop and advance its pipeline and partnered candidates. Several key recent developments include:</p>
<ul>
<li>ยท Announced plans to advance investigational plozasiran into a Phase 3 cardiovascular outcomes trial called CAPITAN, which is designed to enroll patients with mixed hyperlipidemia and residual risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease;</li>
<li>ยท Announced successful top-line results from the pivotal Phase 3 PALISADE study of investigational plozasiran in patients with familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS). The Company highlighted recent data for its cardiometabolic pipeline at its June 25, 2024, Cardiometabolic event;</li>
<li>ยท Presented preclinical data on ARO-INHBE for the treatment of obesity and metabolic diseases at the American Diabetes Association 84 Scientific Sessions. INHBE small interfering RNA (siRNA) administration resulted in multiple promising findings including: (1) 95% reduction in INHBE mRNA expression, (2) 19% suppression of body weight compared to saline controls, (3) 26% loss of fat mass, and (4) preservation of lean mass; th</li>
<li>ยท Announced results from the Phase 2b double blind, randomized ARCHES-2 study of investigational zodasiran in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia;</li>
<li>ยท Announced that new interim clinical data on ARO-RAGE achieves high level of gene knockdown in patients with asthma;</li>
<li>ยท Completed enrollment in Amgen's Phase 3 OCEAN(a) - outcome trial of olpasiran, triggering a $50.0 million milestone payment to the Company, which was paid in the third quarter of fiscal 2024;</li>
<li>ยท Presented final data from the double-blind treatment period of the Company's Phase 2 SHASTA-2 study of investigational plozasiran in patients with severe Hypertriglyceridemia. Results from the SHASTA-2 study showed dramatic, consistent, and sustained reductions in Apolipoprotein C-III (APOC3) and triglycerides and improvement in multiple atherogenic lipoprotein levels;</li>
<li>ยท Announced an Expanded Access Program ("EAP") to make investigational plozasiran available outside of a clinical trial for qualifying patients with FCS;</li>
<li>ยท Initiated a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of ARO-DM1, being developed as a potential treatment for type 1 myotonic dystrophy (DM1), the most common adult-onset muscular dystrophy;</li>
<li>ยท Filed an application for clearance to initiate a Phase 1/2a clinical trial of ARO-CFB, being developed as a potential treatment for complement mediated renal disease;</li>
<li>ยท Entered into an Amended and Restated License Agreement with GSK, pursuant to which GSK received a worldwide, exclusive license to develop and commercialize daplusiran/tomligisiran (GSK5637608, formerly JNJ-3989). Daplusiran/tomligisiran had previously been licensed to Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. See Note 2.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Consolidation and Basis of Presentation</h2>
<p>The interim Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and its subsidiaries (wholly-owned subsidiaries and a variable interest entity for which the Company is the primary beneficiary). Subsidiaries refer to Arrowhead Madison, Inc., Visirna Therapeutics, Inc. ("Visirna"), and Arrowhead Australia Pty Ltd. For subsidiaries in which the Company owns or is exposed to less than 100% of the economics, the Company records net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in its consolidated statements of operations equal to the percentage of the economic or ownership interests retained in such entity by the respective noncontrolling party.</p>
<p>The interim Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). The financial data of the Company included herein are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all material adjustments of a normal recurring nature have been made to present fairly the Company's financial position at June 30, 2024 and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation.</p>
<p>Certain financial information that is normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, but that is not required for interim reporting purposes, has been omitted from the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements and related notes. Readers are urged to review the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023 for more complete descriptions and discussions. Operating results and cash flows for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024.</p>
<h2>Liquidity</h2>
<p>The Company's primary sources of financing have been through the sale of its equity securities, revenue from its licensing and collaboration agreements and the sale of certain future royalties. Research and development activities have required significant capital investment since the Company's inception and are expected to continue to require significant cash expenditure in the future, particularly as the Company's pipeline of drug candidates and its headcount have both expanded. Additionally, significant capital investment will be required as the Company's pipeline matures into later stage clinical trials.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2024, the Company had $69.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash ($2.2 million in restricted cash) and $367.3 million in available-forsale securities to fund operations. During the nine months ended June 30, 2024, the Company's cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and investments balance increased by $33.0 million which was primarily due to the net proceeds of $429.3 million from the underwritten offering in January 2024 discussed below, offset by ongoing expenses related to the Company's research and development programs, general and administrative expenses and capital expenditures.</p>
<p>On January 2, 2024, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with Jefferies LLC, BofA Securities, Inc.,</p>
<p>and Cowen and Company, LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters. The Company issued 15,790,000 shares of common stock at a price of $28.50 per share. The aggregate purchase price paid by investors was $450.0 million and the Company received net proceeds of $429.3 million after deducting advisory fees and offering expenses.</p>
<p>In total, the Company is eligible to receive up to $2.7 billion in developmental, regulatory and sales milestones, and may receive various royalties on net sales from its licensing and collaboration agreements, subject to the terms and conditions of those agreements. The revenue recognition for these collaboration agreements is discussed further in Note 2.</p>
<h2>Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</h2>
<p>There have been no changes to the significant accounting policies disclosed in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.</p>
<h2>Uncertainty in Income Taxes</h2>
<p>The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $3.3 million and expense of $0.8 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The income tax benefit is primarily due to the discrete change in the Company's uncertain tax positions related to the statute of limitation expiration.</p>
<h2>Recent Accounting Pronouncements</h2>
<p>In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standard Update ("ASU") 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , to improve its income tax disclosure requirements. Under the guidance, entities must annually (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. This guidance will become effective for the Company beginning on October 1, 2025. The Company does not expect any material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures resulting from applying this ASU.</p>
<p>In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through additional disclosures about significant segment expenses. The guidance requires public companies with a single reportable segment to provide all disclosures required under ASC 280. In addition, the guidance requires public companies to include in interim reports all disclosures related to a reportable segment's profit or loss and assets that are currently required in annual reports. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. The Company does not expect any material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures resulting from applying this ASU.</p>

<p>In June 2021, Horizon and the Company entered into a collaboration and license agreement (the "Horizon License Agreement"). Under the terms of the Horizon License Agreement, Horizon received a worldwide exclusive license for HZN-457, a clinical-stage medicine being developed by Horizon as a potential treatment for people with uncontrolled gout.</p>
<p>At the inception of the Horizon License Agreement, the Company identified one distinct performance obligation. The Company determined that the key deliverables included the license and certain R&amp;D services, including the Company's responsibilities to conduct all activities through the preclinical stages of development of HZN-457 (the "Horizon R&amp;D Services").

The Company determined that the key deliverables included the license and certain R&amp;D services including the Company's responsibilities to complete the initial portion of the SEQUOIA study, to complete the ongoing Phase 2 AROAAT2002 study and to ensure certain manufacturing of fazirsiran drug product is completed and delivered to Takeda (the "Takeda R&amp;D Services"). Due to the specialized and unique nature of these Takeda R&amp;D Services and their direct relationship with the license, the Company determined that these deliverables represent one distinct bundle and, thus, one performance obligation. Beyond the Takeda R&amp;D Services, which are the responsibility of the Company, Takeda will be responsible for managing future clinical development and commercialization outside the United States. Within the United States, the Company will also participate in co-development and cocommercialization efforts and will co-fund these efforts with Takeda as part of the 50/50 profit sharing structure within the United States. The Company considers the collaborative activities, including the co-development and co-commercialization, to be a separate unit of account within Topic 808, and as such, these co-funding amounts are recorded as research and development expenses or general and administrative expenses, as appropriate.</p>

<p>The Company allocated the total $300.0 million initial transaction price to itsone distinct performance obligation for the fazirsiran license and the associated Takeda R&amp;D Services. Revenue was recognized using the input method (based on actual patient visits completed versus total estimated visits completed for the ongoing SEQUOIA and AROAAT2002 clinical studies). The Phase 2 study visits for patients in the SEQUOIA and AROAAT2002 studies concluded by December 31, 2023, and the Company has substantially completed its performance obligation under the Takeda License Agreement. As such, all revenue has been fully recognized as of December 31, 2023. There were no further deferred revenue and contract liabilities as of June 30, 2024 .</p>

<h2>NOTE 8. LEASES</h2>
<p>Pasadena, California : The Company leases 49,000 square feet of office space located at 177 East Colorado Blvd. for its corporate headquarters from 177 Colorado Owner, LLC, which lease expires on April 30, 2027. The lease contains an option to renew for one additional five-year term. The Company is not reasonably certain that it will exercise this option to</p>
<p>renew and therefore it is not included in right-of-use assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2024.</p>
<p>San Diego, California : The Company leases 144,000 square feet of office and research and development laboratory space located at 10102 Hoyt Park from 11404 &amp; 11408 Sorrento Valley Owner, LLC, which lease expires on April 30, 2038. Pursuant to the lease, within twelve months of the expiration of the initial 15-year term, the Company has the option to extend the lease for up to one additional ten-year term, with certain annual increases in base rent. The Company is not reasonably certain that it will exercise this option to renew and therefore it is not included in right-of-use assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2024.</p>

<h2>NOTE 9. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION</h2>
<h2>Stock Plans</h2>
<p>The Company has two plans that provide for equity-based compensation under the 2013 and the 2021 plans. Under the 2013 Incentive Plan (the "2013 Plan"),2,924,586 shares of the Company's common stock are reserved for grants of stock options and restricted stock awards to employees and directors as of June 30, 2024.</p>
<p>Under the 2021 Incentive Plan (the "2021 Plan"),8,000,000 shares (subject to certain adjustments) of the Company's common stock are reserved for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted and unrestricted stock, performance awards, cash awards and other awards convertible into or otherwise based on shares of the Company's common stock. The maximum number of shares authorized under the 2021 Plan will be (i) reduced by any shares subject to awards made under the 2013 Plan after January 1, 2021, and (ii) increased by any shares subject to outstanding awards under the 2013 Plan as of January 1, 2021 that, after January 1, 2021, are canceled, expired, forfeited or otherwise not issued under such awards (other than as a result of being tendered or withheld to pay the exercise price or withholding taxes in connection with any such awards) or settled in cash. As of June 30, 2024, the total number of shares available for issuance was 4,565,727 shares, which includes 158,928 and 154,139 shares that were forfeited under the 2013 and 2021 Plans, respectively, and 3,697,189 shares have been granted under the 2021 Plan.</p>
<p>In addition, there were 665,020 shares reserved for options and616,638 shares reserved for restricted stock units issued as inducement grants to new employees granted outside of the Company's equity-based compensation plans under Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules.</p>

<h2>Stock Option Awards</h2>
<p>The following table presents a summary of the stock option activity for the nine months ended June 30, 2024:</p>
<p>| | Shares | Weighted- Average Exercise Price Per Share | Weighted- Average Remaining Contractual Term (Years) | Aggregate Intrinsic Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Outstanding at September 30, 2023 | 2,263,477 | $ 22.68 | | |
| Granted | - | - | | |
| Cancelled or expired | (53,582) | 36.62 | | |
| Exercised | (197,398) | 10.98 | | |
| Outstanding at June 30, 2024 | 2,012,497 | $ 23.22 | 3.8 | $ 22,486,304 |
| Exercisable at June 30, 2024 | 2,001,968 | $ 23.05 | 3.8 | $ 22,486,304 |</p>
<p>The aggregate intrinsic values represent the amount by which the market price of the underlying stock exceeds the</p>
<p>exercise price of the option. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised during the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was $0.7 million and $6.5 million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of the options exercised during the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 was $3.8 million and $10.1 million, respectively.</p>
<p>Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options outstanding for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, was $0.4 million and $2.1 million, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options outstanding for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, was $2.5 million and $6.7 million, respectively.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2024, the pre-tax compensation expense for all outstanding unvested stock options in the amount of $0.4 million will be recognized in the Company's results of operations over a weighted average period of 3 months.</p>
<p>The fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options, which do not have vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. The determination of the fair value of each stock option is affected by the Company's stock price on the date of grant, as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. Because the Company's employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its employee stock options.</p>
<p>The following table provides the assumptions used in the calculation of grant-date fair values of these stock options based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model:</p>
<p>| | Nine Months Ended June 30, | Nine Months Ended June 30, |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | 2024 (5) | 2023 |
| Expected dividend yield (1) | N/A | - |
| Risk-free interest rate (2) | N/A | 3.69% |
| Expected volatility (3) | N/A | 86.4% |
| Expected term (in years) (4) | N/A | 6.25 |
| Weighted average grant date fair value per share of options granted | N/A | $24.80 |</p>
<p>Visirna ESOP : On October 1, 2023, Visirna, a subsidiary of the Company, granted 7,500,000 stock options to its employees from the Employee Stock Option Plan (the "Visirna ESOP"), which authorizes 20,000,000 shares for issuance. The Visirna ESOP is independently managed by Visirna, including the valuation process. For the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024, stock-based compensation expense related to the Visirna ESOP was $2.3 million and $5.5 million, respectively.</p>
<h2>Restricted Stock Units</h2>
<p>Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs"), including market-based, time-based and performance-based awards, have been granted under the Company's 2013 and 2021 Plans and as inducements grants granted outside of the Company's equity-based compensation plans. At vesting, each outstanding RSU will be exchanged for one share of the Company's common stock. RSU awards generally vest subject to the satisfaction of service requirements or the satisfaction of both service requirements and achievement of certain performance targets.</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the activity of the Company's RSUs:</p>
<p>| | Number of RSUs | Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Outstanding at September 30, 2023 | 4,241,640 | $ 58.43 |
| Granted | 1,876,825 | 30.67 |
| Vested | (927,766) | 53.16 |
| Forfeited | (160,775) | 41.75 |
| Outstanding at June 30, 2024 | 5,029,924 | $ 49.58 |</p>
<p>The fair value of RSUs was determined based on the closing price of the Company's common stock on the grant date, with consideration given to the probability of achieving service and/or performance conditions for awards.</p>
<p>For the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded $14.3 million and $17.8 million of expense related to RSUs, respectively. For the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the Company recorded $46.5 million and $53.2 million of expense related to RSUs, respectively. As of June 30, 2024, there was $96.3 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to RSUs that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of1.6 years.</p>
<h2>NOTE 10. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS</h2>
<p>The Company employs a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The Company's valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value and the definition of the three levels (Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3) of the fair value hierarchy are disclosed in Note 10 - Fair Value Measurements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Part IV, "Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules" of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023.</p>
<p>The Company uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including during periods of market disruption. In periods of market disruption, the ability to observe prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified from Level 1 to Level 2, or from Level 2 to Level 3. The Company recognizes transfers between levels at either the actual date of the event or a change in circumstances that caused the transfer. At June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the Company did not have any financial assets or financial liabilities based on Level 3 measurements.</p>
<p>The following table presents information about the Company's assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company:</p>

<h2>NOTE 11. LIABILITY RELATED TO THE SALE OF FUTURE ROYALTIES</h2>
<p>In November 2022, the Company and Royalty Pharma entered into the Royalty Pharma Agreement, pursuant to which Royalty Pharma agreed to pay up to $410.0 million in cash to the Company in consideration for the Company's future royalty interest in olpasiran, a siRNA originally developed by the Company and licensed to Amgen in September 2016 under the Olpasiran Agreement.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the Royalty Pharma Agreement, Royalty Pharma paid $250.0 million upfront and agreed to pay up to an</p>
<p>additional $160.0 million in aggregate one-time milestone payments due if and when the following milestone events occur: (i) $50.0 million on completion of enrollment in the OCEAN Phase 3 clinical trial for olpasiran, (ii) $50.0 million upon receipt of FDA approval of olpasiran for an approved indication (reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction, urgent coronary revascularization, or coronary heart disease death in adults with established cardiovascular disease and elevated Lp(a)), and (iii) $60.0 million upon Royalty Pharma's receipt of at least $70.0 million of royalty payments under the Royalty Pharma Agreement in any single calendar year. During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, Amgen completed enrollment of the Phase 3 OCEAN(a) outcomes trial of olpasiran, which triggered a $50.0 million milestone payment that the Company received in the same quarter.</p>
<p>In consideration for the payment of the foregoing amounts under the Royalty Pharma Agreement, Royalty Pharma is entitled to receive all royalties otherwise payable by Amgen to the Company under the Olpasiran Agreement. The Company remains eligible to receive any milestone payments potentially payable by Amgen under the Olpasiran Agreement.</p>
<p>The Company has evaluated the terms of the Royalty Pharma Agreement and concluded, in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance, that the Company accounted for the transaction as debt and the funding of $250.0 million and $50.0 million from Royalty Pharma were recorded as liabilities related to the sale of future royalties on its consolidated balance sheets. The Company is not obligated to repay these funds received under the Royalty Pharma Agreement.</p>
<p>The Company records the obligations at their carrying value using the effective interest method. In order to amortize the sale of future royalties, the Company utilizes the prospective method to estimate the future royalties to be paid by the Company to the counterparty over the life of the arrangement. Under the prospective method, a new effective interest rate is determined based on the revised estimate of remaining cash flows. The new rate is the discount rate that equates the present value of the revised estimate of remaining cash flows with the carrying amount of the debt, and it will be used to recognize non-cash interest expense for the remaining periods. The Company periodically assesses the amount and the timing of expected royalty payments using a combination of internal projections and forecasts from external sources. The estimates of future net product sales (and resulting royalty payments) are based on key assumptions including population, penetration, probability of success and sales price, among others. To the extent such payments are greater or less than the Company's initial estimates or the timing of such payments is different than its original estimates, the Company will prospectively adjust the amortization of the royalty financing obligations and the effective interest rate. As of June 30, 2024, the estimated effective interest rate was 6.3%.</p>
<p>The following table presents the activity with respect to the liability related to the sale of future royalties.</p>
<p>| | Carrying Amount (in thousands) |

<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
<p>The Company develops medicines that treat intractable diseases by silencing the genes that cause them. Using a broad portfolio of RNA chemistries and efficient modes of delivery, the Company's therapies trigger the RNAi interference mechanism to induce rapid, deep and durable knockdown of target genes. RNAi is a mechanism present in living cells that inhibits the expression of a specific gene, thereby affecting the production of a specific protein. RNAi-based therapeutics may leverage this natural pathway of gene silencing to target and shut down specific disease-causing genes.</p>
<p>The Company has focused its resources on therapeutics that exclusively utilize its high levels of pharmacologic activity in multiple animal models spanning several therapeutic areas. The Company believes that TRiM enabled therapeutics offer several potential advantages over prior generation and competing technologies, including: simplified manufacturing and reduced costs; multiple routes of administration including subcutaneous injection and inhaled administration; the ability to target multiple tissue types including liver, lung, CNS, muscle and adipose tissue; and the potential for improved safety and reduced risk of intracellular buildup, because there are fewer metabolites from smaller, simpler molecules. TM</p>
<p>The Company's clinical pipeline includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>ยท Hypertriglyceridemia - plozasiran (formerly ARO-APOC3);</li>
<li>ยท Dyslipidemia - zodasiran (formerly ARO-ANG3);</li>
<li>ยท Cardiovascular disease - olpasiran (formerly AMG 890 or ARO-LPA, out-licensed to Amgen);</li>

<p>The Company operates lab facilities in California and Wisconsin, where its research and development activities, including the development of RNAi therapeutics, take place. The Company's principal executive offices are located in Pasadena, California.</p>
<p>The Company continues to develop other clinical candidates for future clinical trials. Clinical candidates are tested internally and through Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicology studies at outside laboratories. Drug materials for such studies and clinical trials are either manufactured internally or contracted to third-party manufacturers. The Company engages third-party contract research organizations (CROs) to manage clinical trials and works cooperatively with such organizations on all aspects of clinical trial management, including plan design, patient recruiting, and follow up. These outside costs, including toxicology/efficacy testing and manufacturing costs, as well as the preparation for and administration of clinical trials, are referred to as "candidate costs." As clinical candidates progress through clinical development, candidate costs will increase.</p>

<p>Net loss attributable to Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was $170.8 million and $102.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net loss attributable to Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. was $429.0 million and $95.6 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net loss per share - diluted was $1.38 and $0.96 for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Net loss per share - diluted was $3.63 and $0.90 for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.</p>
<p>The changes in net loss attributable to the Company for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 were mainly due to a decrease in revenue from the Company's license and collaboration agreements, in conjunction with increased research and development expenses, which have continued to increase as the Company's pipeline of candidates has expanded and progressed through clinical trial phases.</p>
<p>The Company had $69.4 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, $367.3 million in available-for-sale securities, and $883.8 million of total assets as of June 30, 2024, as compared to $110.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, $292.7 million in available-for-sale securities and $765.6 million of total assets as of September 30, 2023. Based upon the Company's current cash and investment resources and operating plan, the Company expects to have sufficient liquidity to fund operations for at least the next twelve months from the date of the issuance of these financial statements.</p>
<h2>Critical Accounting Estimates</h2>
<p>There have been no significant changes to the Company's critical accounting estimates disclosed in the most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023.</p>
<h2>RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</h2>

<h2>Revenue</h2>
<p>Total revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2024 decreased by $15.8 million or 100.0% from the same period of 2023. Total revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 decreased by $221.1 million, or 98.4% from the same period of 2023. The changes were primarily driven by decreased revenue recognition associated with the Company's license and collaboration agreements during the nine months ended June 30, 2024. The revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 was mainly driven by the revenue recognition associated with Takeda, GSK, and Horizon/Amgen license agreements, as discussed below.</p>
<p>The Company has evaluated each agreement in accordance with FASB Topic 808Collaborative Arrangements and Topic 606Revenue for Contracts from Customers . See Note 2 - Collaboration and License Agreements to Consolidated Financial Statements of Part I, "Item 1. Financial Statements" for more information on revenue recognized under the collaboration and license agreements.</p>
<p>Takeda : In October 2020, Takeda and the Company entered into the Takeda License Agreement. The Company has allocated the total $300.0 million initial transaction price to its one distinct performance obligation for the fazirsiran license and the associated Takeda R&amp;D Services. Revenue was recognized using the input method (based on actual patient visits completed versus total estimated visits completed for the ongoing SEQUOIA and AROAAT2002 clinical studies). The Phase 2 study visits for patients in the SEQUOIA and AROAAT2002 studies concluded by December 31, 2023, and the Company has substantially completed its performance obligation under the Takeda License Agreement. As such, all revenue has been fully recognized as of December 31, 2023.</p>
<p>During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded $146.5 million revenue, including a $40.0 million milestone payment by dosing the first patient in the Phase 3 REDWOOD clinical study of fazirsiran.</p>
<p>GSK : On December 11, 2023, GSK and the Company entered into the GSK-HBV Agreement. Under the GSK-HBV Agreement, GSK received a worldwide, exclusive license to develop and commercialize daplusiran/tomligisiran (GSK5637608, formerly JNJ-3989). Daplusiran/tomligisiran had previously been licensed to Janssen in October 2018. Under the terms of the GSK-HBV Agreement, the Company received $2.7 million in December 2023, upon signing the GSK-HBV Agreement.</p>
<p>During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded a $30.0 million milestone payment by dosing the first patient in a Phase 2b trial under GSK-HSD License Agreement.</p>
<p>Horizon/Amgen : During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded $6.7 million revenue of the total $40.0 million upfront payment received in July 2021, which was recognized on a straight-line basis over the timeframe for completing the Horizon R&amp;D Services, concluding in the first quarter of 2023. There was also $1.5 million of reimbursable costs. Horizon enrolled the first subject in December 2022 in a Phase 1 randomized, placebo-controlled trial to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of HZN-457, triggering a $15.0 million milestone payment to the Company which was paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Further, Amgen enrolled the first subject in its Phase 3 trial of olpasiran, which triggered a $25.0 million milestone payment to the Company which was paid in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. On October 6, 2023, Amgen Inc. completed its acquisition of Horizon and subsequently notified the Company of Amgen's intent to terminate the HZN457 license. Horizon exercised its right to terminate the Horizon License Agreement for convenience, which took effect on December 21, 2023.</p>
<h2>Operating Expenses</h2>
<p>The analysis below details the operating expenses and discusses the expenditures of the Company within the major expense categories. For purposes of comparison, the amounts for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 are shown in the tables below.</p>
<h2>Research and Development (R&amp;D) Expenses</h2>
<p>R&amp;D expenses are related to the Company's research and development discovery efforts and related candidate costs, which are comprised primarily of outsourced costs related to the manufacturing of clinical supplies, toxicity/efficacy studies and clinical trial expenses. Internal costs primarily relate to discovery operations at the Company's research facilities in California and Wisconsin, including facility costs and laboratory-related expenses. The Company does not separately track R&amp;D expenses by individual research and development project, or by individual drug candidate. The Company operates in a cross-functional manner across projects and does not separately allocate facilities-related costs, candidate costs, discovery costs, compensation expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses, and other expenses related to research and development activities.</p>
<p>The following table provides details of research and development expenses for the periods indicated:</p>
<p>| | Three Months Ended | % of Expense | Three Months Ended June 30, 2023 | % of Expense | Increase (Decrease) | Increase (Decrease) |

| Total research and development expense | $ 370,044 | 100 % | $ 253,333 | 100 % | $ 116,711 | 46 % |</p>
<p>Candidate costs increased $37.2 million, or 90%, for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and $47.5 million, or 43%, for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. This increase was primarily due to the additional progression of the Company's pipeline of candidates into and through clinical trials, which resulted in higher manufacturing, outsourced clinical trial, and toxicity study costs.</p>
<p>R&amp;D discovery costs increased $10.6 million, or 53%, for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and $34.5 million, or 69%, for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. This increase was primarily driven by the growth of the Company's discovery efforts and continued advancement into novel therapeutic areas and tissue types, along with rising costs associated with CNS studies and lab supplies.</p>
<p>Salaries consist of salary, bonuses, payroll taxes, and related benefits for the Company's R&amp;D personnel. Salaries expense increased $7.9 million, or 47%, for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and $24.3 million, or 51%, for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily due to an increase in R&amp;D headcount that has occurred as the Company has expanded its pipeline of candidates, in addition to annual salary increases.</p>
<p>Facilities-related expense includes lease costs for the Company's research and development facilities in San Diego, California and Madison, Wisconsin. Facilitiesrelated costs increased $2.3 million, or 48%, for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and $8.0 million, or 69%, for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. This increase was mainly due to the ATIAs on the lease in San Diego, California. See Note 8 - Leases of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of Part I, "Item 1. Financial Statements."</p>
<p>Stock compensation expense, a non-cash expense, was based upon the valuation of stock options and restricted stock units granted to employees. Stock compensation expense decreased $1.7 million, or 19%, for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and $2.4 million, or 9%, for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The decrease was primarily due to the cancelled awards upon the departure of employees.</p>
<p>Depreciation and amortization expense, a non-cash expense, increased $1.4 million, or 49% for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and $4.8 million, or 65%, for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily attributed to higher leasehold improvements, due to completion of the development of the San Diego facility. Additionally, as of December 31, 2023, the Company completed the build out of one of its laboratory and office facilities in Verona, Wisconsin, and commenced depreciation.</p>
<p>The Company anticipates these R&amp;D expenses to continue to increase as its pipeline of candidates grows and</p>
<p>progresses to later phase clinical trials, in addition to inflationary pressure on goods and services and the labor market.</p>

The increase was driven by the combination of annual salary increases and increased headcount required to support the Company's growth.</p>
<p>Professional, outside services, and other expense includes legal, consulting, patent expenses, business insurance expenses, other outside services, travel, and communication and technology expenses. This expense decreased $0.6 million, or 10%, for the three months ended June 30, 2024 and increased $1.6 million, or 11%, for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023.

The decrease was mainly due to the decreased compensation costs related to performance awards.</p>
<p>Depreciation and amortization expense, a noncash expense, was primarily related to amortization of leasehold improvements for the Company's corporate headquarters.</p>
<p>The Company anticipates these general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as its pipeline of candidates grows and progresses to later phase clinical trials including commercialization efforts, in addition to inflationary pressure on goods and services and the labor market.</p>
<h2>Other Income (Expense)</h2>
<p>Other income (expense) is primarily related to interest income and expense. Other income increased $2.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023. The increase was primarily due to the higher</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<p>yields on investments due to higher interest rates, offset by the non-cash interest expense on the liability related to the sale of future royalties. The balance remained consistent for the nine months ended June 30, 2024 compared to the same period of 2023.</p>
<h2>LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES</h2>
<p>The Company has historically financed its operations through the sale of its equity securities, revenue from its licensing and collaboration agreements, and the sale of certain future royalties. Research and development activities have required significant capital investment since the Company's inception and are expected to continue to require significant cash expenditure as the Company's pipeline continues to expand and matures into later stage clinical trials. Additionally, the Company expanded its facilities in Verona, Wisconsin and leased additional facilities in San Diego, California. Each of these expansions is designed to increase the Company's internal manufacturing and discovery capabilities and requires significant capital investment.</p>
<p>The Company's cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased to $69.4 million at June 30, 2024 compared to $110.9 million at September 30, 2023. Cash invested in available-for-sale securities was $367.3 million at June 30, 2024 compared to $292.7 million at September 30, 2023.</p>

<p>On January 2, 2024, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with Jefferies LLC, BofA Securities, Inc., and Cowen and Company, LLC, as representatives of the several underwriters. The Company issued 15,790,000 shares of common stock at an offering price of $28.50 per share. The aggregate purchase price paid by investors was $450.0 million and the Company received net proceeds of $429.3 million after deducting advisory fees and offering expenses.</p>
<p>The Company believes its current financial resources are sufficient to fund its operations through at least the next twelve months from the date of the issuance of these financial statements.</p>
<p>The following table presents a summary of cash flows:</p>

<h2>Financing Agreement</h2>
<p>On August 7, 2024 (the "Closing Date"), the Company entered into a financing agreement (the "Financing Agreement") with the guarantors party thereto, the lenders party thereto (the "Lenders"), and Sixth Street Lending Partners, as the administrative agent and collateral agent for the Lenders. The Financing Agreement provides for a senior secured term loan facility of up to an aggregate principal amount of $935.3 million (the "Credit Facility"), consisting of (a) an initial draw term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million, funded on the Closing Date (the "Initial Loan"), (b) a delayed draw term loan in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding $435.3 million (the "Delayed Draw Term Loan") and (c) an uncommitted incremental facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $100.0 million (the "Incremental Facility" and the loans made thereof, the "Incremental Term Loans"). The Credit Facility matures on August 7, 2031 (the "Maturity Date") and bears interest at an annual rate equal to 15.0%. Certain additional commitment and undrawn amount fees are also payable in connection with the Credit Facility.</p>
<p>The Company is permitted to use the proceeds of the Initial Loan for working capital, capital expenditures and</p>
<p>general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries. The proceeds of Delayed Draw Term Loans made after the Closing Date are permitted to be applied by the Company solely to pay interest on the Credit Facility. The Incremental Term Loans made after the Closing Date are permitted to be applied by Company in a manner as agreed upon between the Company and the administrative agent.</p>
<p>The Credit Facility does not provide for scheduled amortization payments during the term. All principal will be due on the Maturity Date. The Company will have the right to prepay loans under the Credit Facility at any time. The Company is required to partially repay loans under the Credit Facility with proceeds from certain asset sales, condemnation events and extraordinary receipts, subject, in some cases, to reinvestment rights. Repayments are not subject to a prepayment premium.</p>
<p>All obligations under the Financing Agreement will be secured on a first-priority basis, subject to certain exceptions, by security interests in substantially all assets of the Company and material subsidiaries of the Company, including its intellectual property, and will be guaranteed by material subsidiaries of the Company, including foreign subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions.</p>
<p>The Financing Agreement contains customary covenants, including, without limitation, negative covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, restrict indebtedness, liens, investments (including acquisitions), fundamental changes, asset sales and licensing transactions, dividends, modifications to material agreements, payment of subordinated indebtedness, and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements. The Company is subject to restrictions on sales and licensing transactions with respect to certain core intellectual property, subject to certain exceptions, including certain transactions related to areas outside the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Japan and China.</p>
<p>The Financing Agreement also contains certain events of default after which loans under the Credit Facility may be due and payable immediately, including payment defaults, material inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings, cross-defaults to certain other agreements, judgments against the Company and its subsidiaries, cessation of business and change of control.</p>
<p>The above description of the Financing Agreement and Credit Facility is a summary only and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Financing Agreement, which will be filed as an exhibit to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending September 30, 2024.</p>
