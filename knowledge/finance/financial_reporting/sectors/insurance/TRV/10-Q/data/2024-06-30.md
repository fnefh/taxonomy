NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)
------------------------------------------------------

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES
------------------------------------------------

Basis of Presentation
---------------------

The interim consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Travelers Companies, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the Company). These financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and are unaudited. In the opinion of the Company's management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation have been reflected. Certain financial information that is normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, but that is not required for interim reporting purposes, has been omitted. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the Company's 2023 Annual Report).

The preparation of the interim consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the interim consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and claims and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. To the extent that the Company changes its accounting for, or presentation of, items in the financial statements, the presentation of such amounts in prior periods is changed to conform to the current period presentation, if appropriate, and disclosed, if material.

On January 2, 2024, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of all issued and outstanding shares of Corvus Insurance Holdings, Inc. (Corvus), a cyber insurance managing general underwriter, for consideration transferred of approximately $427 million. The acquisition provides the Company the opportunity to renew Corvus's book of business and to leverage Corvus's capabilities to enhance the return profile of Travelers' existing cyber portfolio. At the acquisition date, the Company recorded at fair value $478 million of assets acquired and $51 million of liabilities assumed as part of purchase accounting, including $390 million of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. The assets acquired from Corvus were included in the Company's Bond & Specialty Insurance segment, effective at the acquisition date. The Company funded this transaction from internal resources. A provisional amount of $19 million was recorded as a deferred tax asset and included on the consolidated balance sheet on January 2, 2024, the date of the acquisition. As the tax return for Corvus for the 2023 fiscal year will not be finalized until the third quarter of 2024, a measurement period adjustment is expected to be recorded in the third quarter of 2024.

Income Taxes
------------

The Company recognized a one-time tax benefit of $211 million in the first quarter of 2023 due to the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to a tax item impacted by the repeal of Internal Revenue Code Section 847, which related to the discounting of property-casualty loss reserves.

2. SEGMENT INFORMATION
----------------------

Nature of Operations
--------------------

The Company's results are reported in the following three business segments - Business Insurance, Bond & Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance. These segments reflect the manner in which the Company's businesses are currently managed and represent an aggregation of products and services based on the type of customer, how the business is marketed and the manner in which risks are underwritten. For more information regarding the Company's nature of operations, see the "Nature of Operations " section of note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the Company's 2023 Annual Report.

Pre-refunded bonds of $975 million and $966 million at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, were bonds for which U.S. states or municipalities have established irrevocable trusts that are almost exclusively comprised of U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government and government agencies and authorities. These trusts were created to fund the payment of principal and interest due under the bonds.

Proceeds from the sales of fixed maturities classified as available for sale were $1.25 billion and $3.12 billion during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gross gains of $2 million and $19 million and gross losses of $41 million and $51 million were realized on those sales during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Included in realized losses for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, are $33 million and $0 million, respectively, of losses resulting from the early redemption of fixed maturities by the issuer prior to the bonds' maturity date.

Unrealized Investment Losses
----------------------------

The following tables summarize, for all fixed maturities classified as available for sale in an unrealized loss position at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the aggregate fair value and gross unrealized loss by the length of time those securities have been continuously in an unrealized loss position. The fair value amounts reported in the tables are estimates that are prepared using the process described in note 4 herein and in note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the Company's 2023 Annual Report. The Company also relies upon estimates of several factors in its review and evaluation of individual investments, using the process described in note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the Company's 2023 Annual Report to determine whether a credit loss impairment exists.

Other Investments
-----------------

Included in other investments are private equity, hedge fund and real estate partnerships that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and typically report their financial statement information to the Company one month to three months following the end of the reporting period. Accordingly, net investment income from these other investments is generally reflected in the Company's financial statements on a quarter lag basis.

4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
--------------------------

The Company's estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework is based on the inputs used in valuation, gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available. The disclosure of fair value estimates in the fair value accounting guidance hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable. In determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed, the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect the Company's significant market assumptions. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is reported is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the hierarchy are as follows:

* · Level 1 -Unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company has the ability to access.
* · Level 2 -Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets; or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severities, etc.) or can be corroborated by observable market data.
* · Level 3 -Valuations based on models where significant inputs are not observable. The unobservable inputs reflect the Company's own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use.

Valuation of Investments Reported at Fair Value in Financial Statements
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Company utilized a pricing service to estimate fair value measurements for approximately99% of its fixed maturities at both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

While the vast majority of the Company's fixed maturities are included in Level 2, the Company holds a number of corporate bonds which are not valued by the pricing service and estimates the fair value of these bonds using either another internal pricing matrix, a present value income approach or a broker quote (collectively, the other methodologies). The other methodologies include some unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation. Due to the limited amount of observable market information available in the estimation of fair value, the Company includes the fair value estimates for bonds that are valued using the other methodologies in Level 3.

For certain investments in non-public common and preferred equity securities, the fair value estimate is determined either internally or by an external fund manager based on the impact of recent observable transactions on the investment, recent filings, operating results, balance sheet stability, growth and other business and market sector fundamentals. Due to the significant unobservable inputs in these valuations, the Company included the fair value estimate of $38 million and $37 million for these investments at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, in the amounts disclosed in Level 3.

For more information regarding the valuation of the Company's fixed maturities, equity securities and other investments, see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the Company's 2023 Annual Report.

Prior Year Reserve Development
------------------------------

The following disclosures regarding reserve development are on a "net of reinsurance" basis.

For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, estimated claims and claim adjustment expenses incurred included $232 million and $118 million, respectively, of net favorable development for claims arising in prior years, including $321 million and $165 million, respectively, of net favorable prior year reserve development, and $22 million and $23 million, respectively, of accretion of discount.

Business Insurance. Net favorable prior year reserve development in the second quarter of 2024 totaled $34 million, primarily driven by better than expected loss experience in the domestic operations' workers' compensation product line for multiple accident years, partially offset by higher than expected loss experience in the general liability product line for recent accident years, driven by excess coverages, as well as an addition to reserves related to run-off operations. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in the second quarter of 2023 totaled $101 million, primarily driven by higher than expected loss experience in the domestic operations' (i) general liability product line for primary and excess coverages for multiple accident years, (ii) commercial multi-peril product line for multiple accident years and (iii) commercial automobile product line for recent accident years, partially offset by (iv) better than expected loss experience in the workers' compensation product line for multiple accident years.

Net favorable prior year reserve development in the first six months of 2024 totaled $34 million, primarily driven by better than expected loss experience in the domestic operations' workers' compensation product line for multiple accident years, partially offset by higher than expected loss experience in the general liability product line for recent accident years, as well as an addition to reserves related to run-off operations. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in the first six months of 2023 totaled $82 million, primarily driven by higher than expected loss experience in the domestic operations' (i) general liability product line for primary and excess coverages for multiple accident years, (ii) commercial automobile product line for multiple accident years and (iii) commercial multi-peril product line for recent accident years, partially offset by (iv) better than expected loss experience in the workers' compensation product line for multiple accident years.

Bond & Specialty Insurance. Net favorable prior year reserve development in the second quarter and first six months of 2024 totaled $24 million and $48 million, respectively, primarily driven by better than expected loss experience in the domestic operations' fidelity and surety product lines for recent accident years. Net favorable prior year reserve development in the second quarter and first six months of 2023 totaled $119 million and $177 million, respectively, primarily driven by better than expected loss experience in the domestic operations' general liability product line for management liability coverages and in the fidelity and surety product lines for recent accident years.

Personal Insurance.

9. COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES
---------------------------

During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company repurchased1.1 million and 2.3 million common shares, respectively, under its share repurchase authorizations for total cost of $250 million and $500 million, respectively. The average cost per share repurchased was $211.22 and $214.22, respectively. In addition, the Company acquired 12,170 shares and 0.7 million common shares for a total cost of $3 million and $141 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, that were not part of its publicly announced share repurchase authorizations.

10. EARNINGS PER SHARE

The following is a reconciliation of the income (loss) and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations for the periods presented:

|  | Three Months Ended June 30, | Three Months Ended June 30, | Six Months Ended June 30, | Six Months Ended June 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (in millions, except per share amounts) | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| Basic and Diluted |  |  |  |  |

| Participating share-based awards - allocated income | (5) | (1) | (13) | (7) |
| Net income (loss) available to common shareholders - basic and diluted | $ 529 | $ (15) | $ 1,644 | $ 954 |
| Common Shares |  |  |  |  |
| Basic |  |  |  |  |
| Weighted average shares outstanding | 228.6 | 229.7 | 228.8 | 230.6 |
| Diluted |  |  |  |  |
| Weighted average shares outstanding | 228.6 | 229.7 | 228.8 | 230.6 |
| Weighted average effects of dilutive securities - stock options and performance shares | 2.9 | - | 3.0 | 2.7 |
| Total | 231.5 | 229.7 | 231.8 | 233.3 |
| Net Income (Loss) per Common Share |  |  |  |  |
| Basic | $ 2.32 | $ (0.07) | $ 7.19 | $ 4.14 |
| Diluted | $ 2.29 | $ (0.07) | $ 7.09 | $ 4.09 |

Net loss per basic and diluted common share for the three months ended June 30, 2023 excluded the allocation of $2 million of undistributed loss to participating sharebased awards, since such allocation would result in anti-dilution of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended June 30, 2023. In addition, the net loss per diluted common share for the three months ended June 30, 2023 excluded the incremental impact of 2.5 million stock options and performance shares, since the impact of these potential shares of common stock and their effects on income was anti-dilutive for the three months ended June 30, 2023.

13. LEASES
----------

The Company enters into lease agreements for real estate that is primarily used for office space in the ordinary course of business. These leases are accounted for as operating leases, whereby lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, and a right-of-use asset and lease liability is recognized as part of other assets and other liabilities, respectively, in the consolidated balance sheet.

Most leases include an option to extend or renew the lease term. The exercise of the renewal option is at the Company's discretion. The operating lease liability includes lease payments related to options to extend or renew the lease term if the Company is reasonably certain of exercising those options. The Company, in determining the present value of lease payments, utilizes either the rate implicit in the lease, if that rate is readily determinable, or the Company's incremental secured borrowing rate commensurate with the term of the underlying lease.

14. CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES
---------------------------------------------

Contingencies
-------------

The major pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the Company's properties is subject are described below.

Asbestos and Environmental Claims and Litigation
------------------------------------------------

In the ordinary course of its insurance business, the Company has received and continues to receive claims for insurance arising under policies issued by the Company asserting alleged injuries and damages from asbestos- and environmental-related exposures that are the subject of related coverage litigation. The Company is defending asbestos- and environmental-related litigation vigorously and believes that it has meritorious defenses; however, the outcomes of these disputes are uncertain. In this regard, the Company employs dedicated specialists and comprehensive resolution strategies to manage asbestos and environmental loss exposure, including settling litigation under appropriate circumstances. Currently, it is not possible to predict legal outcomes and their impact on future loss development for claims and litigation relating to asbestos and environmental claims. Any such development could be affected by future court decisions and interpretations, as well as future changes, if any, in applicable legislation. Because of these uncertainties, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the Company's current insurance reserves. In addition, the Company's estimate of ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. These additional liabilities or changes in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the Company's results of operations in future periods.

Other Proceedings Not Arising Under Insurance Contracts or Reinsurance Agreements
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Company is involved in other lawsuits, including lawsuits alleging extra-contractual damages relating to insurance contracts or reinsurance agreements, that do not arise under insurance contracts or reinsurance agreements. The legal costs associated with such lawsuits are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred. Based upon currently available information, the Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that any such lawsuit or related lawsuits would be material to the Company's results of operations or would have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or liquidity.

The following discussions of the Company's net income (loss) and segment income (loss) are presented on an after-tax basis. Discussions of the components of net income (loss) and segment income (loss) are presented on a pre-tax basis, unless otherwise noted. Discussions of net income (loss) per common share are presented on a diluted basis.

Overview
--------

Diluted net income per share was $2.29 in the second quarter of 2024, compared to a diluted net loss per share of $0.07 in the same period of 2023. Net income was $534 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to a net loss of $14 million in the same period of 2023. The increase in income before income taxes in the second quarter of 2024 primarily reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) higher underwriting margins excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development ("underlying underwriting margins"), (ii) higher net investment income and (iii) higher net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by (iv) higher catastrophe losses and (v) higher net realized investment losses. Catastrophe losses in the second quarters of 2024 and 2023 were $1.51 billion and $1.48 billion, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in the second quarters of 2024 and 2023 was $230 million and $60 million, respectively. The higher underlying underwriting margins in the second quarter of 2024 were driven by Personal Insurance, Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance. The Company recorded income tax expense in the second quarter of 2024 compared with an income tax benefit in the same period of 2023. The change in income taxes primarily reflected the impact of the increase in income before income taxes.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, Continued
-----------------------------------------------

Diluted net income per share of $7.09 in the first six months of 2024 increased by 73% over diluted net income per share of $4.09 in the same period of 2023. Net income of $1.66 billion in the first six months of 2024 increased by 72% over net income of $961 million in the same period of 2023. The higher rate of increase in diluted net income per share reflected the impact of share repurchases in recent periods. The increase in income before income taxes primarily reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) higher underlying underwriting margins, (ii) higher net investment income and (iii) higher net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by (iv) higher catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses in the first six months of 2024 and 2023 were $2.22 billion and $2.02 billion, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in the first six months of 2024 and 2023 was $321 million and $165 million, respectively. The higher underlying underwriting margins in the first six months of 2024 were driven by Personal Insurance, Business Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance. The Company recorded income tax expense in the first six months of 2024 compared with an income tax benefit in the same period of 2023. The change in income taxes primarily reflected the impact of the increase in income before income taxes and a one-time tax benefit of $211 million in the first quarter of 2023 due to the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to a tax item.

The Company has insurance operations in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and throughout other parts of the world as a corporate member of Lloyd's, as well as in Brazil and Colombia through joint ventures. Because these operations are conducted in local currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the Company is subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For the three months and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted reported line items in the statement of income (loss) by insignificant amounts. The impact of these changes was not material to the Company's net income (loss) or segment income (loss) for the periods reported.

Revenues
--------

Earned Premiums
---------------

Earned premiums in the second quarter of 2024 were $10.24 billion, $1.03 billion or 11% higher than in the same period of 2023. Earned premiums in the first six months of 2024 were $20.37 billion, $2.30 billion or 13% higher than in the same period of 2023. In Business Insurance, earned premiums in the second quarter and first six months of 2024 increased by 11% and 13%, respectively, over the same periods of 2023. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, earned premiums in the second quarter and first six months of 2024 increased by 7% and 8%, respectively, over the same periods of 2023. In Personal Insurance, earned premiums in the second quarter and first six months of 2024 increased by 12% and 13%, respectively, over the same periods of 2023. Factors contributing to the changes in earned premiums in each segment are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.

Net Investment Income
---------------------

The following table sets forth information regarding the Company's investments.

|  | Three Months Ended June 30, | Three Months Ended June 30, | Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 | Six Months Ended June 30, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Average investments (1) | $ 95,402 | $ 89,536 | $ 95,062 | $ 89,208 |
| Pre-tax net investment income | 885 | 712 | 1,731 | 1,375 |
| After-tax net investment income | 727 | 594 | 1,425 | 1,151 |
| Average pre-tax yield (2) | 3.7 % | 3.2 % | 3.6 % | 3.1 % |

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Net investment income in the second quarter of 2024 was $885 million, $173 million or 24% higher than in the same period of 2023. Net investment income in the first six months of 2024 was $1.73 billion, $356 million or 26% higher than in the same period of 2023. Net investment income from fixed maturity investments in the second quarter and first six months of 2024 was $709 million and $1.40 billion, respectively, $118 million and $235 million higher, respectively, than in the same periods of 2023. The increases in both periods of 2024 primarily resulted from higher long-term average yields and a higher average level of fixed maturity investments. Net investment income from short-term securities in the second quarter and first six months of 2024 was $70 million and $140 million, respectively, $15 million and $38 million higher, respectively, than in the same periods of 2023. The increase in the second quarter of 2024 primarily resulted from a higher level of short-term investments. The

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, Continued
-----------------------------------------------

increase in the first six months of 2024 primarily resulted from a higher level of short-term investments and higher short-term average yields. The Company's remaining investment portfolios had net investment income of $118 million and $216 million, respectively, in the second quarter and first six months of 2024, $40 million and $85 million higher, respectively, than in the same periods of 2023. The increases in both periods of 2024 primarily reflected higher private equity partnership returns. Included in other investments are private equity, hedge fund and real estate partnerships that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and typically report their financial statement information to the Company one month to three months following the end of the reporting period. Accordingly, net investment income from these other investments is generally reflected in the Company's financial statements on a quarter lag basis.

Fee Income
----------

Fee income in the second quarter of 2024 was $115 million, $9 million higher than in the same period of 2023. Fee income in the first six months of 2024 was $224 million, $12 million higher than in the same period of 2023. The National Accounts market in Business Insurance is the primary source of the Company's fee-based business and is discussed in the Business Insurance segment discussion that follows.

Net Realized Investment Gains (Losses)
--------------------------------------

The following table sets forth information regarding the Company's net realized investment gains (losses).

|  | Three Months Ended June 30, | Three Months Ended June 30, | Six Months Ended June 30, | Six Months Ended June 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (in millions) | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| Impairment gains (losses): |  |  |  |  |
| Fixed maturities | $ - | $ - | $ (3) | $ (1) |
| Net realized investment gains (losses) on equity securities still held | (28) | (14) | 51 | 3 |
| Other net realized investment gains (losses), including from sales | (37) | (21) | (78) | (31) |
| Total | $ (65) | $ (35) | $ (30) | $ (29) |

Net realized investment losses on equity securities still held of $28 million in the second quarter of 2024 were driven by a net unfavorable change in fair value on an individual security held in the Company's portfolio, partially offset by the impact of changes in fair value attributable to favorable equity markets. Net realized investment gains on equity securities still held of $51 million in the first six months of 2024 were driven by the impact of changes in fair value attributable to favorable equity markets. Net realized investment losses on equity securities still held of $14 million in the second quarter of 2023 were driven by the impact of changes in fair value attributable to unfavorable equity markets. Net realized investment gains on equity securities still held of $3 million in the first six months of 2023 were driven by the impact of changes in fair value attributable to favorable equity markets.

Other Revenues
--------------

Other revenues in the second quarter of 2024 were $105 million, $6 million higher than in the same period of 2023. Other revenues in the first six months of 2024 were $217 million, $43 million higher than in the same period of 2023. Other revenues include revenues from Simply Business, installment premium charges and other policyholder service charges.

Claims and Expenses
-------------------

Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses
------------------------------------

Claims and claim adjustment expenses in the second quarter of 2024 were $7.37 billion, $146 million or 2% higher than in the same period of 2023, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) higher business volumes and (ii) higher catastrophe losses, partially offset by (iii) higher net favorable prior year reserve development, (iv) lower fire and non-weather water losses in the homeowners and other product line and lower physical damage losses in the automobile product line in Personal Insurance and (v) the comparison to an elevated level of losses in the prior year quarter from a small number of surety accounts in Bond & Specialty Insurance. Catastrophe losses in the second quarter of both 2024 and 2023 primarily resulted from numerous severe wind and hail storms in multiple states.

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
----------------------------------------------

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, Continued
-----------------------------------------------

Claims and claim adjustment expenses in the first six months of 2024 were $14.03 billion, $843 million or 6% higher than in the same period of 2023, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) higher business volumes and (ii) higher catastrophe losses, partially offset by (iii) lower fire and non-weather water losses in the homeowners and other product line and lower physical damage losses in the automobile product line in Personal Insurance, (iv) higher net favorable prior year reserve development and (v) the comparison to an elevated level of losses in the same period of 2023 from both a small number of surety accounts and loss activity related to the disruption in the banking sector in Bond & Specialty Insurance. Catastrophe losses in the first six months of 2024 included the second quarter events described above, as well as severe wind and hail storms in the central and eastern regions of the United States in the first three months of 2024.

Factors contributing to net prior year reserve development during the second quarters and first six months of 2024 and 2023 are discussed in more detail in note 7 of the notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.

Significant Catastrophe Losses
------------------------------

The following table presents the amount of losses recorded by the Company for significant catastrophes that occurred in the three months and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the amount of net unfavorable (favorable) prior year reserve development recognized in the three months and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 for significant catastrophes that occurred in 2023 and 2022, and the estimate of ultimate losses for those catastrophes at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. For purposes of the table, a significant catastrophe is an event for which the Company estimates its ultimate losses will be $100 million or more after reinsurance and before taxes. The Company's threshold for disclosing catastrophes is primarily determined at the reportable segment level and for 2024 ranged from $20 million to $30 million of losses before reinsurance and taxes. For the Company's definition of a catastrophe, refer to "Part II-Item 7-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Consolidated Overview" in the Company's 2023 Annual Report.

Interest Expense
----------------

Interest expense in the second quarter and first six months of 2024 was $98 million and $196 million, respectively, compared with $92 million and $180 million, respectively, in the same periods of 2023.

Income Tax Expense (Benefit)
----------------------------

Income tax expense in the second quarter of 2024 was $122 million, compared with an income tax benefit of $34 million in the same period of 2023. The change in income taxes primarily reflected the impact of the $704 million increase in income before income taxes in the second quarter of 2024. Income tax expense in the first six months of 2024 was $369 million, compared with an income tax benefit of $81 million in the same period of 2023. The change in income taxes primarily reflected the impact of the $1.15 billion increase in income before income taxes in the first six months of 2024 and the one-time tax benefit of $211 million in the first quarter of 2023 due to the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to a tax item.

The Company's effective tax rate was 19% and 71% in the second quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The Company's effective tax rate was 18% and (9)% in the first six months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effective tax rate in the first six months of 2023 was reduced by the impact of the one-time tax benefit discussed above. The effective tax rate for all periods reflected the impact of tax-exempt investment income on the calculation of the Company's income tax provision.

Net favorable prior year reserve development in the second quarters of 2024 and 2023 provided 2.2 points and 0.7 points of benefit, respectively, to the combined ratio. The combined ratio excluding prior year reserve development and catastrophe losses ("underlying combined ratio") in the second quarter of 2024 was 3.4 points lower than the 2023 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impact of the benefit of earned pricing.

The combined ratio of 97.1% in the first six months of 2024 was 4.0 points lower than the combined ratio of 101.1% in the same period of 2023. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 68.4% for the first six months of 2024 was 4.0 points lower than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 72.4% in the same period of 2023. The underwriting expense ratio of 28.7% for the first six months of 2024 was comparable with the underwriting expense ratio in the same period of 2023.

Catastrophe losses in the first six months of 2024 and 2023 accounted for 10.9 points and 11.2 points, respectively, of the combined ratio. Net favorable prior year reserve development in the first six months of 2024 and 2023 provided 1.5 points and 0.9 points of benefit, respectively, to the combined ratio.

Overview
--------

Segment income in the second quarter of 2024 was $170 million, $60 million or 26% lower than segment income of $230 million in the same period of 2023. The decrease in segment income before income taxes primarily reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) lower net favorable prior year reserve development and (ii) higher catastrophe losses, partially offset by (iii) higher underlying underwriting margins and (iv) higher net investment income. Net favorable prior year reserve development in the second quarters of 2024 and 2023 was $24 million and $119 million, respectively. Catastrophe losses in the second quarters of 2024 and 2023 were $40 million and $21 million, respectively. The higher underlying underwriting margins primarily reflected the impacts of (i) higher business volumes and (ii) the comparison to an elevated level of losses in the prior year quarter from a small number of surety accounts, partially offset by (iii) higher general and administrative expenses. Income tax expense in the second quarter of 2024 was lower than in the same period of 2023, primarily reflecting the impact of the decrease in segment income before income taxes.

Segment income in the first six months of 2024 was $365 million, $72 million or 16% lower than segment income of $437 million in the same period of 2023. The decrease in segment income before income taxes primarily reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) lower net favorable prior year reserve development and (ii) higher catastrophe losses, partially offset by (iii) higher net investment income and (iv) higher underlying underwriting margins. Net favorable prior year reserve development in the first six months of 2024 and 2023 was $48 million and $177 million, respectively. Catastrophe losses in the first six months of 2024 and 2023 were $45 million and $26 million, respectively. The higher underlying underwriting margins primarily reflected the impacts of (i) higher business volumes and (ii) the comparison to an elevated level of losses in the same period of 2023 from both a small number of surety accounts and loss activity related to the disruption in the banking sector, partially offset by (iii) higher general and administrative expenses. Income tax expense in the first six months of 2024 was lower than in the same period of 2023, primarily reflecting the impact of the decrease in segment income before income taxes and a one-time tax benefit of $9 million in the first quarter of 2023 due to the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to a tax item.

Renewal premium changes in the first six months of 2024 remained positive but were slightly lower than in the same period of 2023. New business premiums in the second quarter and first six months of 2024 decreased from the same periods of 2023.

After-tax interest expense in the first six months of 2024 and 2023 was $155 million and $142 million, respectively.

ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION
------------------------------

The Company believes that the property and casualty insurance industry has suffered from court decisions and other trends that have expanded insurance coverage for asbestos claims far beyond the original intent of insurers and policyholders. The Company has received and continues to receive a significant number of asbestos claims. Factors underlying these claim filings include continued intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants and the focus by plaintiffs on defendants, such as manufacturers of talcum powder, who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation. The focus on these defendants is primarily the result of the number of traditional asbestos defendants who have sought bankruptcy protection in previous years. The bankruptcy of many traditional defendants has also caused increased settlement demands against those policyholders who are not in bankruptcy but remain in the tort system. Currently, in many jurisdictions, those who allege very serious injury and who can present credible medical evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts, while those who have not shown any credible disease manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket. Prioritizing claims involving credible evidence of injuries, along with the focus on defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation, contributes to the claims and claim adjustment expense payment patterns experienced by the Company. The Company's asbestos-related claims and claim adjustment expense experience also has been impacted by the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers.

The Company continues to be involved in disputes, including litigation, with a number of policyholders, some of whom are in bankruptcy, over coverage for asbestosrelated claims. Many coverage disputes with policyholders are only resolved through settlement agreements. Because many policyholders make exaggerated demands, it is difficult to predict the outcome of settlement negotiations. Settlements involving bankrupt policyholders may include extensive releases which are favorable to the Company, but which could result in settlements for larger amounts than originally anticipated. Although the Company has seen a reduction in the overall risk associated with these disputes, it remains difficult to predict the ultimate cost of these claims. As in the past, the Company will continue to pursue settlement opportunities.

----------------------------------------------

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, Continued
-----------------------------------------------

In addition to claims against policyholders, proceedings have been launched directly against insurers, including the Company, by individuals challenging insurers' conduct with respect to the handling of past asbestos claims and by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos-related bodily injuries. It is possible that other direct actions against insurers, including the Company, could be filed in the future. It is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, including whether the plaintiffs would be able to sustain these actions against insurers based on novel legal theories of liability. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to any such claims and has received favorable rulings in certain jurisdictions.

Because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, the Company generally reviews the exposure presented by each policyholder with open claims at least annually. Among the factors the Company may consider in the course of this review are: available insurance coverage, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; limits and deductibles; an analysis of the policyholder's potential liability; the jurisdictions involved; past and anticipated future claim activity and loss development on pending claims; past settlement values of similar claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; the potential role of other insurance; the role, if any, of non-asbestos claims or potential non-asbestos claims in any resolution process; and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a products/completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim.

The Company's quarterly asbestos reserve reviews include an analysis of exposure and claim payment patterns by policyholder, as well as recent settlements, policyholder bankruptcies, judicial rulings and legislative actions. The Company also analyzes developing payment patterns among policyholders and the assumed reinsurance component of reserves, as well as projected reinsurance billings and recoveries. In addition, the Company reviews its historical gross and net loss and expense paid experience, year-by-year, to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations, or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity. Conventional actuarial methods are not utilized to establish asbestos reserves, and the Company's evaluations have not resulted in a reliable method to determine a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment.

Over the past decade, the property and casualty insurance industry, including the Company, has experienced net unfavorable prior year reserve development with regard to asbestos reserves, but the Company believes that over that period there has been a reduction in the volatility associated with the Company's overall asbestos exposure as the overall asbestos environment has evolved from one dominated by exposure to significant litigation risks, particularly coverage disputes relating to policyholders in bankruptcy who were asserting that their claims were not subject to the aggregate limits contained in their policies, to an environment primarily driven by a frequency of litigation related to individuals with mesothelioma. The Company's overall view of the current underlying asbestos environment is essentially unchanged from recent periods, and there remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure to asbestos claims.

Net asbestos paid loss and loss expenses in the first six months of 2024 and 2023 were $135 million and $89 million, respectively. Net asbestos reserves were $1.24 billion and $1.22 billion at June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION
-----------------------------------

The Company has received and continues to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage arising out of the alleged storage, emissions or disposal of toxic substances, frequently under policies issued prior to the mid-1980s. These claims are mainly brought pursuant to various state or federal statutes that require a liable party to undertake or pay for environmental remediation. For example, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) enables private parties as well as federal and state governments to take action with respect to releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances. This federal statute permits the recovery of response costs from some liable parties and may require liable parties to undertake their own remedial action. Liability under these statutes may be joint and several with other responsible parties. The Company has also been, and continues to be, involved in litigation involving insurance coverage issues pertaining to environmental claims. The Company believes that some court decisions pertaining to environmental claims have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders.

In establishing environmental reserves, the Company evaluates the exposure presented by each policyholder and the anticipated cost of resolution, if any. In the course of its analysis, the Company generally considers the probable liability, available coverage and relevant judicial interpretations. In addition, the Company considers the many variables presented, such as: the nature of the alleged activities of the policyholder at each site; the number of sites; the total number of potentially responsible parties at each site; the nature of the alleged environmental harm and the corresponding remedy at each site; the nature of government enforcement activities at each site; the ownership and general use of each site; the overall nature of the insurance relationship between the Company and the policyholder, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; the involvement of other insurers; the potential for other available coverage, including the number of years of coverage; the role, if any, of non-environmental claims or potential non-environmental claims in any resolution process; and the applicable law in each jurisdiction. The evaluation of the exposure presented by a policyholder can

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
----------------------------------------------

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, Continued
-----------------------------------------------

change as information concerning that policyholder and the many variables presented is developed. Conventional actuarial methods are not used to estimate these reserves.

Over the past several years, the Company has experienced generally favorable trends in the number of new policyholders tendering environmental claims for the first time and in the number of pending declaratory judgment actions relating to environmental matters. These policyholders continue to present smaller exposures, are involved in fewer hazardous waste sites and are lower tier defendants than policyholders presenting such claims in the past. Further, in many instances, clean-up costs have been reduced because regulatory agencies are willing to accept risk-based site analyses and more efficient clean-up technologies. However, the degree to which those favorable trends have continued has been less than anticipated. In addition, reserve development on existing environmental claims as well as the costs associated with coverage litigation on environmental matters has been greater than anticipated, driven by claims and legal developments in a limited number of jurisdictions. As a result of these factors, the Company increased its net environmental reserves by $8 million and $37 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2024, respectively, and by $17 million and $48 million in the second quarter and first six months of 2023, respectively. Net environmental paid loss and loss expenses in the first six months of 2024 and 2023 were $32 million and $46 million, respectively. Net environmental reserves were $386 million and $374 million at June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES
---------------------------------------------------------------------

As a result of the processes and procedures discussed above, management believes that the reserves carried for asbestos and environmental claims are appropriately established based upon known facts, current law and management's judgment. However, the uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these claims continue, and it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. As a result, these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop. The continuing uncertainties include, without limitation:

* · the risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation;
* · a further increase in the cost to resolve, and/or the number of, asbestos and environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated;
* · the emergence of a greater number of asbestos claims than anticipated as a result of extended life expectancies resulting from medical advances and lifestyle improvements;
* · the role of any umbrella or excess policies we have issued;
* · the resolution or adjudication of disputes concerning coverage for asbestos and environmental claims in a manner inconsistent with our previous assessment of these disputes;
* · the number and outcome of direct actions against us;
* · future developments pertaining to our ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims;
* · any impact on asbestos defendants we insure due to the bankruptcy of other asbestos defendants;
* · the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers; and
* · uncertainties arising from the insolvency or bankruptcy of policyholders.

Changes in the legal, regulatory and legislative environment may impact the future resolution of asbestos and environmental claims and result in adverse loss reserve development. The emergence of a greater number of asbestos or environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated may result in adverse loss reserve development. Changes in applicable legislation and future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations, including the outcome of legal challenges to legislative and/or judicial reforms establishing medical criteria for the pursuit of asbestos claims, could affect the settlement of asbestos and environmental claims. It is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. This is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective. As part of its continuing analysis of asbestos and environmental reserves, the Company continues to study the implications of these and other developments.

Because of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the Company's current reserves. In addition, the Company's estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. These additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the Company's operating results in future periods.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO
--------------------

The Company's invested assets at June 30, 2024 were $89.51 billion, of which 93% was invested in fixed maturity and short-term investments, 1% in equity securities, 1% in real estate investments and 5% in other investments. Because the primary purpose of the investment portfolio is to fund future claims payments, the Company employs a thoughtful investment philosophy that focuses on appropriate risk-adjusted returns. A significant majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of high quality, liquid, taxable U.S. government, tax-exempt and taxable U.S. municipal and taxable corporate and U.S. agency mortgagebacked bonds.

The carrying value of the Company's fixed maturity portfolio at June 30, 2024 was $79.19 billion. The Company closely monitors the duration of its fixed maturity investments, and investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available to satisfy the Company's insurance and debt obligations. The weighted average credit quality of the Company's fixed maturity portfolio, both including and excluding U.S. Treasury securities, was "Aa2" at both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Below investment grade securities represented 1.2% and 1.3% of the total fixed maturity investment portfolio at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The weighted average effective duration of fixed maturities and short-term securities was 4.2 (4.4 excluding short-term securities) at June 30, 2024 and 4.1 (4.4 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2023.

Obligations of U.S. States, Municipalities and Political Subdivisions

The Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 included $27.26 billion and $28.51 billion, respectively, of securities which are obligations of U.S. states, municipalities and political subdivisions (collectively referred to as the municipal bond portfolio). The municipal bond portfolio is diversified across the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and includes general obligation and revenue bonds issued by states, cities, counties, school districts and similar issuers. Included in the municipal bond portfolio at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $975 million and $966 million, respectively, of prerefunded bonds, which are bonds for which U.S. states or municipalities have established irrevocable trusts, almost exclusively comprised of U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government and government agencies and authorities. These trusts were created to fund the payment of principal and interest due under the bonds. The irrevocable trusts are verified as to their sufficiency by an independent verification agent of the underwriter, issuer or trustee. All of the Company's holdings of securities issued by Puerto Rico and related entities have either been pre-refunded and therefore are defeased by U.S. Treasury securities or have FHA guarantees subject to federal appropriation.

The Company bases its investment decision on the underlying credit characteristics of the municipal security. The weighted average credit rating of the municipal bond portfolio was "Aaa/Aa1" at both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Mortgage-Backed Securities, Collateralized Mortgage Obligations and Pass-Through Securities

The Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 included $10.20 billion and $7.82 billion, respectively, of residential mortgage-backed securities, including pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), all of which are subject to prepayment risk (either shortening or lengthening of duration). While prepayment risk for securities and its effect on income cannot be fully controlled, particularly when interest rates move dramatically, the Company's inve stment strategy generally favors securities that reduce this risk within expected interest rate ranges. Included in the totals at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $7.81 billion and $6.23 billion, respectively, of GNMA, FNMA, FHLMC (excluding FHA project loans) and Canadian government guaranteed residential mortgage-backed pass-through securities classified as available for sale. Also included in those totals were residential CMOs classified as available for sale with a fair value of $2.39 billion and $1.59 billion at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Approximately 40% and 33% of the Company's CMO holdings at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, were guaranteed by or fully collateralized by securities issued by GNMA, FNMA or FHLMC. The weighted average credit rating of the $1.44 billion and $1.07 billion of non-guaranteed CMO holdings was "Aaa" at bot h June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The weighted average credit rating of all of the above securities was "Aaa/Aa1" at both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. For further discussion regarding the Company's investments in residential CMOs, see "Part II-Item 7-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Investment Portfolio" in the Company's 2023 Annual Report.

Equity Securities, Real Estate and Short-Term Investments

See note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the Company's 2023 Annual Report for further information about these invested asset classes.

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
----------------------------------------------

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, Continued
-----------------------------------------------

Other Investments
-----------------

The Company also invests in private equity, hedge fund and real estate partnerships, and joint ventures. These asset classes have historically provided a higher return than investments in fixed maturities but are subject to more volatility. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of the Company's other investments was $4.37 billion and $4.30 billion, respectively.

Investments in private equity, hedge fund and real estate partnerships are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and typi cally report their financial statement information to the Company one month to three months following the end of the reporting period. Accordingly, net investment income from these other investments is generally reflected in the Company's financial statements on a quarter lag basis.

CATASTROPHE REINSURANCE COVERAGE
--------------------------------

The Company's catastrophe reinsurance coverage is discussed in the "Reinsurance-Catastrophe Reinsurance" section of "Part I-Item 1-Business" in the Company's 2023 Annual Report. Except as discussed below, there have been no material changes to the Company's catastrophe reinsurance coverage from that reported in the Company's 2023 Annual Report.

Catastrophe Bonds. Consistent with the Company's indemnity reinsurance agreement with Long Point Re IV Ltd., the attachment point and maximum limit were reset during the second quarter of 2024 to adjust the expected loss of the layer within a predetermined range. For the period from May 25, 2024 through and including May 24, 2025, this treaty provides up to $575 million of coverage, subject to a $2.79 billion retention.

See the "Reinsurance-Catastrophe Reinsurance" section of "Part I-Item 1-Business" in the Company's 2023 Annual Report for more details, including a discussion of the structure of and accounting for Long Point Re IV.

Other Catastrophe Reinsurance Treaties . Catastrophe reinsurance treaties that renewed on July 1, 2024 were as follows:

* · Northeast Property Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Treaty. This treaty provides up to $1.00 billion of coverage, subject to a $2.75 billion retention, for losses arising from a single occurrence and allows for one reinstatement. Coverage is provided on an all perils basis, including but not limited to hurricanes, tornadoes, hail storms, earthquakes, winter storms and/or freeze losses (coverage is included for terrorism events in limited circumstances). Coverage for cyber events applies only in limited circumstances, and coverage for communicable disease and nuclear, biological and radiological terrorism attacks is excluded from this treaty. The treaty covers territory from Virginia to Maine for the period from July 1, 2024 through and including June 30, 2025. Losses from a covered event anywhere in North America and waters contiguous thereto may be used to satisfy the retention. Recoveries under the catastrophe bonds (if any) would be first applied to reduce losses subject to this treaty.
* · Personal Insurance Hurricane Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Treaty. This treaty provides up to $500 million part of $1.00 billion of coverage for a single event, subject to a $2.00 billion retention (i.e., for every dollar of loss between $2.00 billion and $3.00 billion this treaty provides 50 cents of coverage), for homeowners property losses arising from a hurricane or tropical storm for the period from July 1, 2024 through and including June 30, 2025. The treaty covers the United States coastal states from Texas to Maine, excluding Florida.
* · Middle Market Earthquake Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Treaty . This treaty provides up to $293 million part of $325 million of coverage, subject to a $135 million retention (i.e., for every dollar of loss between $135 million and $460 million this treaty provides 90 cents of coverage), for losses arising from an earthquake, including other ensuing causes of loss such as fire following and sprinkler leakage, incurred under policies written by Technology, Public Sector Services and Commercial Accounts in Business Insurance for the period from July 1, 2024 through and including June 30, 2025. The treaty covers the United States and Canada, their territories, possessions and waters contiguous thereto.
* · Canadian Property Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Treaty. This treaty provides coverage for 50% of losses in excess of C$100 million (US$73 million at June 30, 2024), up to C$200 million (US$146 million at June 30, 2024) and for 100% of losses in excess of C$200 million (US$146 million at June 30, 2024), up to C$500 million (US$366 million at June 30, 2024), in each case with respect to the accumulation of net property losses arising out of one occurrence on business written by the Company's Canadian businesses for the period from July 1, 2024 through and

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, Continued
-----------------------------------------------

including June 30, 2025. The treaty covers all property written by the Company's Canadian businesses, including, but not limited to, habitational property, commercial property, inland marine, ocean marine and auto physical damages exposures. Coverage for cyber events applies only in limited circumstances and coverage for communicable disease and nuclear, biological and radiological terrorism attacks is excluded from this treaty.

The Company regularly reviews its catastrophe reinsurance coverage and may adjust such coverage in the future.

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES
------------------------

The Company reinsures a portion of the risks it underwrites in order to control its exposure to losses. For a description of the Company's reinsurance recoverables, refer to "Part II-Item 7-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Reinsurance Recoverables" in the Company's 2023 Annual Report.

The following table summarizes the composition of the Company's reinsurance recoverables:

| (in millions) | June 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gross reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses | $ 3,952 | $ 3,895 |
| Gross structured settlements | 2,661 | 2,707 |
| Mandatory pools and associations | 1,636 | 1,659 |
| Gross reinsurance recoverables | 8,249 | 8,261 |
| Allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance | (117) | (118) |
| Net reinsurance recoverables | $ 8,132 | $ 8,143 |

Net reinsurance recoverables at June 30, 2024 decreased by $11 million from December 31, 2023.

OUTLOOK
-------

The following discussion provides outlook information for certain key drivers of the Company's results of operations and capital position.

Premiums. The Company's earned premiums are a function of net written premium volume. Net written premiums comprise both renewal business and new business and are recognized as earned premium over the term of the underlying policies. When business renews, the amount of net written premiums associated with that business may increase or decrease (renewal premium change) as a result of increases or decreases in rate and/or insured exposures, which the Company considers as a measure of units of exposure (such as the number and value of vehicles or properties insured). Net written premiums from both renewal and new business, and therefore earned premiums, are impacted by competitive market conditions as well as general economic conditions, which, particularly in the case of Business Insurance, affect audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations. Net written premiums may also be impacted by the structure of reinsurance programs and related costs, as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Overall, the Company expects that retention levels (the amount of expiring premium that renews, before the impact of renewal premium changes) will remain strong by historical standards during the remainder of 2024.

Property and casualty insurance market conditions are expected to remain competitive during the remainder of 2024 for new business. In each of the Company's business segments, new business generally has less of an impact on underwriting profitability than renewal business, given the volume of new business relative to renewal business. However, in periods of meaningful increases in new business, despite its positive impact on underwriting gains over time, the impact of higher new business levels may negatively impact the combined ratio for a period of time. In periods of meaningful decreases in new business, despite its negative impact on underwriting gains over time, the impact of lower new business levels may positively impact the combined ratio for a period of time.

Effective January 1, 2024, the Company renewed a quota share reinsurance agreement with subsidiaries of Fidelis Insurance Holdings Limited (Fidelis) pursuant to which the Company assumes 20% of the gross written premiums of Fidelis during 2024, subject to a loss ratio cap. The Company's portion of premiums from Fidelis is reported as part of the International results of Business Insurance. The Company also has a minority investment in Fidelis.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, Continued
-----------------------------------------------

Underwriting Gain/Loss. The Company's underwriting gain/loss can be significantly impacted by catastrophe losses and net favorable or unfavorable prior year reserve development, as well as underlying underwriting margins. Underlying underwriting margins can be impacted by a number of factors, including variability in noncatastrophe weather, large loss and other loss activity; changes in current period loss estimates resulting from prior period loss development; changes in loss cost trends; changes in business mix; changes in reinsurance coverages and/or costs; premium adjustments; and variability in expenses and assessments.

Catastrophe losses and non-catastrophe weather-related losses are inherently unpredictable from period to period. The Company's results of operations could be adversely impacted if significant catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather-related losses were to occur.

On average for the ten-year period ended December 31, 2023, the Company experienced approximately 40% of its annual catastrophe losses during the second quarter, primarily arising out of severe wind and hail storms, including tornadoes. Hurricanes, wildfires and winter storms tend to happen at other times of the year and can also have a material impact on the Company's results of operations. Catastrophe losses incurred in a particular quarter in any given year may differ materially from historical experience. In addition, most of the Company's reinsurance programs renew on January 1 or July 1 of each year, and, therefore, any changes to the availability, cost or coverage terms of such programs will be effective after such dates.

Over much of the past decade, the Company's results have included significant amounts of net favorable prior year reserve development driven by better than expected loss experience. However, given the inherent uncertainty in estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, loss experience could develop such that the Company recognizes in future periods higher or lower levels of favorable prior year reserve development, no favorable prior year reserve development or unfavorable prior year reserve development. In addition, the ongoing review of prior year claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or other changes in current period circumstances, may result in the Company revising current year loss estimates upward or downward in future periods of the current year.

It is possible that changes in economic conditions, the supply chain, the labor market and geopolitical tensions, as well as steps taken by federal, state and/or local governments and the Federal Reserve could lead to higher or lower inflation than the Company anticipated, which could in turn lead to an increase or decrease in the Company's loss costs and the need to strengthen or reduce claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. These impacts of inflation on loss costs and claims and claim adjustment expense reserves could be more pronounced for those lines of business that require a relatively longer period of time to finalize and settle claims for a given accident year and, accordingly, are relatively more inflation sensitive. For a further discussion, see "Part I-Item 1A-Risk Factors-If actual claims exceed our claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or if changes in the estimated level of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are necessary, including as a result of, among other things, changes in the legal/tort, regulatory and economic environments in which the Company operates, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected" in the Company's 2023 Annual Report.

The Company's results of operations may be impacted by a number of other factors, including an economic slowdown, a recession, financial market volatility, disruption in the banking sector, supply chain disruptions, monetary and fiscal policy measures, heightened geopolitical tensions, fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, the political and regulatory environment, changes to the U.S. Federal budget and potential changes in tax laws.

Investment Portfolio. The Company expects to continue to focus its investment strategy on maintaining a high-quality investment portfolio and a relatively short average effective duration. The weighted average effective duration of fixed maturities and short-term securities was 4.2 (4.4 excluding short-term securities) at June 30, 2024. From time to time, the Company enters into short positions in U.S. Treasury futures contracts to manage the duration of its fixed maturity portfolio. At June 30, 2024, the Company had no open U.S. Treasury futures contracts. The Company regularly evaluates its investment alternatives and mix. Currently, the majority of the Company's investments are comprised of a widely diversified portfolio of high-quality, liquid, taxable U.S. government, tax-exempt and taxable U.S. municipal, taxable corporate and U.S. agency mortgage-backed bonds.

The Company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities, real estate and private equity, hedge fund and real estate partnerships, and joint ventures. These investment classes have the potential for higher returns but also the potential for greater volatility and higher degrees of risk, including less stable rates of return and less liquidity.

Approximately 31% of the fixed maturity portfolio is expected to mature over the next three years (including the early redemption of bonds, assuming interest rates (including credit spreads) do not rise significantly by applicable call dates). As a

result, the overall yield on and composition of its portfolio could be meaningfully impacted by the types of investments available for reinvestment with the proceeds of maturing bonds.

Net investment income is a material contributor to the Company's results of operations. Based on our current expectations for the impact of expected higher reinvestment yields on fixed income investments and higher levels of fixed income investments, the Company expects that after-tax net investment income from that portfolio will be approximately $675 million in the third quarter of 2024 and $695 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. This expectation could be impacted by the direction of interest rates and disruptions in global financial markets. Included in other investments are private equity, hedge fund and real estate partnerships that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and typically report their financial statement information to the Company one month to three months following the end of the reporting period. Accordingly, net investment income or loss from these other investments is generally reflected in the Company's financial statements on a quarter lag basis. The Company's net investment income in future periods from its non-fixed income investment portfolio will be impacted, positively or negatively, by the performance of global financial markets.

The Company had net pre-tax realized investment losses of $30 million in the first six months of 2024. Changes in global financial markets could result in net realized investment gains or losses in the Company's investment portfolio.

The Company had a net pre-tax unrealized investment loss of $5.04 billion ($3.98 billion after-tax) in its fixed maturity investment portfolio at June 30, 2024, compared to $3.97 billion ($3.13 billion after-tax) at December 31, 2023. The net unrealized investment loss is primarily due to the impact of movements in interest rates. The increase in the net unrealized investment loss in the first six months of 2024 was due to increases in interest rates. While the Company does not attempt to predict future interest rate movements, a rising interest rate environment reduces the market value of fixed maturity investments and, therefore, reduces shareholders' equity, and a declining interest rate environment has the opposite effects. The net unrealized loss discussed above is considered temporary in nature as it is not due to credit impairments, there is no impact on expected contractual cash flows from fixed maturities, and the Company generally holds its fixed maturity investments to maturity. In addition, given the temporary nature of net unrealized losses combined with the Company's strong operating cash flows (which include income received on investments) and the proceeds received upon maturity of the investments, the net unrealized investment loss is not expected to meaningfully impact the Company's assessment of capital adequacy or liquidity. Equity securities, which include common and non-redeemable preferred stocks, are reported at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.

Additionally, disruptions in global financial markets could also impact the market value of the Company's investment portfolio. The Company's investment portfolio has benefited from certain tax exemptions (primarily those related to interest from municipal bonds) and certain other tax laws, including, but not limited to, those governing dividends-received deductions and tax credits (such as foreign tax credits). Changes in these laws could adversely impact the value of the Company's investment portfolio. See "Our businesses are heavily regulated by the states and countries in which we conduct business, including licensing, market conduct and financial supervision, and changes in regulation, including changes in tax regulation, may reduce our profitability and limit our growth" included in "Part I-Item 1ARisk Factors" in the Company's 2023 Annual Report.

For further discussion of the Company's investment portfolio, see "Investment Portfolio." For a discussion of the risks to the Company's business during or following a financial market disruption and risks to the Company's investment portfolio, see the risk factors entitled "During or following a period of financial market disruption or an economic downturn, our business could be materially and adversely affected" and "Our investment portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk, and may suffer reduced or low returns or material realized or unrealized losses" included in "Part I-Item 1A-Risk Factors" in the Company's 2023 Annual Report. For a discussion of the risks to the Company's investments from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, see the risk factor entitled "We are subject to additional risks associated with our business outside the United States" included in "Part I-Item 1A-Risk Factors" in the Company's 2023 Annual Report and see "Part II-Item 7AQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk-Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk" in the Company's 2023 Annual Report.

Capital Position . The Company believes it has a strong capital position and, as part of its ongoing efforts to create shareholder value, expects to continue to return capital not needed to support its business operations to its shareholders, subject to the considerations described below. The Company expects that, generally over time, the combination of dividends to common shareholders and common share repurchases will likely not exceed net income. The Company also expects that to the extent that it continues to grow premium volumes, the level of capital to support the Company's financial strength ratings will also increase, and accordingly, the amount of capital returned to shareholders relative to earnings would be somewhat less than it otherwise would have been absent the growth in premium volumes. The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of additional factors, including the Company's financial position, earnings, share price,

catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels appropriate for the Company's business operations, changes in levels of written premiums, funding of the Company's qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the Company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions and related financings), market conditions, changes in tax laws (including the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022) and other factors. For information regarding the Company's common share repurchases in 2024, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources" herein.

As a result of the Company's business outside of the United States, primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom (including Lloyd's), the Republic of Ireland and in Brazil through a joint venture, the Company's capital is also subject to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to other currencies could result in a reduction in shareholders' equity, while a weakening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to other currencies could result in an increase in shareholders' equity. For additional discussion of the Company's foreign exchange market risk exposure, see "Part II-Item 7A-Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in the Company's 2023 Annual Report.

Many of the statements in this "Outlook" section and in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" are forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that are often difficult to predict and beyond the Company's control. Actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Further, such forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report and the Company undertakes no obligation to update them. See "Part IIItem 7-Forward-Looking Statements." For a discussion of potential risks and uncertainties that could impact the Company's results of operations or financial position, see "Part I-Item 2-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" herein and "Part I-Item 1A-Risk Factors" and "Part II-Item 7-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in the Company's 2023 Annual Report, in each case as updated by the Company's periodic filings with the SEC.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
-------------------------------

Liquidity is a measure of a company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations and to satisfy general corporate purposes when needed.

Operating Company Liquidity. The liquidity requirements of the Company's insurance subsidiaries are met primarily by funds generated from premiums, fees, income received on investments and investment maturities. The Company believes that cash flows from operating activities are sufficient to meet the future liquidity requirements of its insurance subsidiaries. Additionally, investment maturities provide a significant level of available liquidity without requiring the sale of investment securities. For further discussion of operating company liquidity, see "Part II-Item 7-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources" in the Company's 2023 Annual Report.

Holding Company Liquidity . TRV's liquidity requirements primarily include shareholder dividends, debt servicing, common share repurchases and, from time to time, contributions to its qualified domestic pension plan. At June 30, 2024, TRV held total cash and short-term invested assets in the United States aggregating $1.73 billion and having a weighted average maturity of 43 days. TRV has established a holding company liquidity target equal to its estimated annual pre-tax interest expense and common shareholder dividends (currently approximately $1.34 billion). TRV's holding company liquidity of $1.73 billion at June 30, 2024 exceeded this target, and it is the opinion of the Company's management that these assets are sufficient to meet TRV's current liquidity requirements.

TRV is not dependent on dividends or other forms of repatriation from its foreign operations to support its liquidity needs. The undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign operations are intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations, and such earnings were not material to the Company's financial position or liquidity at June 30, 2024.

TRV has a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that expires on June 8, 2025 which permits it to issue securities from time to time. TRV also has a $1.0 billion credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires on June 15, 2027. At June 30, 2024, the Company had $100 million of commercial paper outstanding. TRV is not reliant on its commercial paper program to meet its operating cash flow needs. The Company has no senior notes or junior subordinated debentures maturing until April 2026, at which time $200 million of senior notes will mature.

The Company utilized uncollateralized letters of credit issued by major banks with an aggregate limit of $260 million to provide a portion of the capital needed to support its obligations at Lloyd's at June 30, 2024. If uncollateralized letters of credit are not available at a reasonable price or at all in the future, the Company can collateralize these letters of credit or may have to seek alternative means of supporting its obligations at Lloyd's, which could include utilizing holding company funds on hand.

Operating Activities
--------------------

Net cash provided by operating activities in the first six months of 2024 and 2023 was $3.14 billion and $2.56 billion, respectively. The increase in cash flows in the first six months of 2024 primarily reflected the impacts of higher levels of cash received for premiums, partially offset by higher levels of payments for income taxes, commissions and general and administrative expenses.

Investing Activities
--------------------

Net cash used in investing activities in the first six months of 2024 and 2023 was $2.18 billion and $2.31 billion, respectively. The Company's consolidated total investments at June 30, 2024 increased by $701 million, or 1%, over year-end 2023, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) net cash flows provided by operating activities, partially offset by (ii) net cash used in financing activities, (iii) higher net unrealized investment losses due to the impact of higher interest rates during the first six months of 2024 and (iv) the cost of acquiring Corvus.

The Company's investment portfolio is managed to support its insurance operations; accordingly, the portfolio is positioned to meet obligations to policyholders. As such, the primary goals of the Company's asset-liability management process are to satisfy the insurance liabilities and maintain sufficient liquidity to cover fluctuations in projected liability cash flows. Generally, the expected principal and interest payments produced by the Company's fixed maturity portfolio adequately fund the estimated runoff of the Company's insurance reserves. Although this is not an exact cash flow match in each period, the substantial amount by which the market value of the fixed maturity portfolio exceeds the value of the net insurance liabilities, as well as the positive cash flow from newly sold policies and the large amount of high quality liquid bonds, contributes to the Company's ability to fund claim payments without having to sell assets at a loss or access credit facilities.

Financing Activities
--------------------

Net cash used in financing activities in the first six months of 2024 and 2023 was $871 million and $455 million, respectively. The totals in both 2024 and 2023 reflected common share repurchases and dividends paid to shareholders, partially offset by the net proceeds from employee stock option exercises. Common share repurchases in the first six months of 2024 and 2023 were $610 million and $856 million, respectively.

Dividends . Dividends paid to shareholders were $473 million and $447 million in the first six months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of the Company's common stock will be at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the Company's financial position, earnings, capital requirements of the Company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors as the Board of Directors deems relevant. Dividends will be paid by the Company only if declared by its Board of Directors out of funds legally available, subject to any other restrictions that may be applicable to the Company. On July 19, 2024, the Company announced that it declared a regular quarterly dividend of $1.05 per share, payable September 30, 2024 to shareholders of record on September 10, 2024.

Share Repurchases . The Company's Board of Directors has approved common share repurchase authorizations under which repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, pursuant to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in private transactions or otherwise. The authorizations do not have a stated expiration date. The Company expects that, generally over time, the combination of dividends to common shareholders and common share repurchases will likely not exceed net income. The Company also expects that to the extent that it continues to grow premium volumes, the amount of capital returned to shareholders relative to earnings would be somewhat less than it otherwise would have been absent the growth in premium volumes. The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company's financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels appropriate for the Company's business operations, changes in levels of written premiums, funding of the Company's qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the Company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions and related financings), market conditions, changes in tax laws (including the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022) and other factors. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 1.1 million and 2.3 million common shares, respectively, under its share repurchase authorizations for a total cost of $250 million and $500 million, respectively. The average cost per share repurchased was $211.22 and $214.22, respectively. On April 19, 2023, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase authorization that added $5.0 billion of repurchase capacity to the $1.60 billion of capacity remaining at that date. At June 30, 2024, the Company had $5.54 billion of capacity remaining under its share repurchase authorizations. Included in the cost of treasury stock acquired pursuant to common share repurchases is the 1% excise tax imposed as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS, Continued
-----------------------------------------------

Capital Resources . Capital resources reflect the overall financial strength of the Company and its ability to borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new capital to meet its needs. The following table summarizes the components of the Company's capital structure at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

| (in millions) | June 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Debt: |  |  |
| Short-term | $ 100 | $ 100 |
| Long-term | 8,004 | 8,004 |
| Net unamortized fair value adjustments and debt issuance costs | (72) | (73) |
| Total debt | 8,032 | 8,031 |
| Shareholders' equity: |  |  |
| Common stock and retained earnings, less treasury stock | 30,272 | 29,392 |
| Accumulated other comprehensive loss | (5,410) | (4,471) |
| Total shareholders' equity | 24,862 | 24,921 |
| Total capitalization | $ 32,894 | $ 32,952 |

The following table provides a reconciliation of total capitalization presented in the foregoing table to total capitalization excluding net unrealized losses on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders' equity.

| (dollars in millions) | June 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Total capitalization | $ 32,894 | $ 32,952 |
| Less: net unrealized losses on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders' equity | (3,976) | (3,129) |
| Total capitalization excluding net unrealized losses on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders' equity | $ 36,870 | $ 36,081 |
| Debt-to-total capital ratio | 24.4 % | 24.4 % |
| Debt-to-total capital ratio excluding net unrealized losses on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders' equity | 21.8 % | 22.3 % |

The debt-to-total capital ratio excluding net unrealized gains (losses) on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders' equity, is calculated by dividing (a) debt by (b) total capitalization excluding net unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders' equity. Net unrealized gains and losses on investments can be significantly impacted by both interest rate movements and other economic factors. Accordingly, in the opinion of the Company's management, the debt-to-total capital ratio calculated on this basis provides another useful metric for investors to understand the Company's financial leverage position. The Company's ratio of debt-to-total capital excluding after-tax net unrealized investment losses included in shareholders' equity of 21.8% at June 30, 2024 was within the Company's target range of 15% to 25%.

RATINGS
-------

Ratings are an important factor in assessing the Company's competitive position in the insurance industry. The Company receives ratings from the following major rating agencies: A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best), Fitch Ratings (Fitch), Moody's Investors Service (Mo ody's) and S&P Global Ratings (S&P). The following rating agency actions were taken with respect to the Company since April 17, 2024, the date on which the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 was filed with the SEC. For additional discussion of ratings, see "Part I-I tem 1-Business-Ratings" in the Company's 2023 Annual Report.

* · On April 22, 2024, Moody's affirmed all ratings of the Company. The outlook for all ratings is stable.
* · On June 18, 2024, S&P affirmed all ratings of the Company. The outlook for all ratings is stable.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES
-----------------------------

For a description of the Company's critical accounting estimates, refer to "Part II-Item 7-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates" in the Company's 2023 Annual Report. The Company considers its most significant accounting estimates to be those applied to claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and related reinsurance recoverables, and impairments of investments, goodwill and other intangible assets. Except as shown in the table below, there have been no material changes to the Company's critical accounting estimates since December 31, 2023.

Claims and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves
--------------------------------------------

The table below displays the Company's gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves by product line. Because establishment of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates and the application of judgment, currently established claims and claim adjustment expense reserves may change. The Company reflects adjustments to the reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed. These changes in estimates could result in income statement charges that could be material to the Company's operating results in future periods. In particular, a portion of the Company's gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves (totaling $2.03 billion at June 30, 2024) are for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. Asbestos and environmental reserves are included in the General liability, Commercial multi-peril and International and other lines in the summary table below. While the ongoing review of asbestos and environmental claims and associated liabilities considers the inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage, plaintiffs' expanded theories of liability and the risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties, in the opinion of the Company's management, it is possible that the outcome of the continued uncertainties regarding these claims could result in liability in future periods that differs from current insurance reserves by an amount that could be material to the Company's future operating results. Asbestos and environmental reserves are discussed separately; see "Asbestos Claims and Litigation", "Environmental Claims and Litigation" and "Uncertainty Regarding Adequacy of Asbestos and Environmental Reserves" in this report.

Gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves by product line were as follows:

|  | June 30, 2024 | June 30, 2024 | June 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| (in millions) | Case | IBNR | Total | Case | IBNR | Total |
| General liability | $ 5,657 | $ 10,909 | $ 16,566 | $ 5,658 | $ 10,214 | $ 15,872 |
| Commercial property | 1,370 | 432 | 1,802 | 1,447 | 281 | 1,728 |
| Commercial multi-peril | 2,852 | 3,346 | 6,198 | 2,869 | 2,905 | 5,774 |
| Commercial automobile | 2,720 | 2,997 | 5,717 | 2,661 | 2,773 | 5,434 |
| Workers' compensation | 9,977 | 9,067 | 19,044 | 10,004 | 9,203 | 19,207 |
| Fidelity and surety | 243 | 512 | 755 | 265 | 466 | 731 |
| Personal automobile | 2,295 | 2,528 | 4,823 | 2,245 | 2,460 | 4,705 |
| Personal homeowners and other | 1,234 | 2,580 | 3,814 | 1,217 | 2,004 | 3,221 |
| International and other | 2,576 | 2,557 | 5,133 | 2,620 | 2,329 | 4,949 |
| Property-casualty | 28,924 | 34,928 | 63,852 | 28,986 | 32,635 | 61,621 |
| Accident and health | 5 | - | 5 | 6 | - | 6 |
| Claims and claim adjustment expense reserves | $ 28,929 | $ 34,928 | $ 63,857 | $ 28,992 | $ 32,635 | $ 61,627 |

The $2.23 billion increase in gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves since December 31, 2023 primarily reflected the impacts of (i) catastrophe losses in the first six months of 2024, (ii) higher volumes of insured exposures and (iii) loss cost trends for the current accident year, partially offset by (iv) claim payments made during the first six months of 2024 and (v) net favorable prior year reserve development.

Some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ include, but are not limited to, the following:

Insurance-Related Risks
-----------------------

* · high levels of catastrophe losses, including as a result of factors such as increased concentrations of insured exposures in catastrophe-prone areas and changing climate conditions, could materially and adversely affect the Company's results of operations, its financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact the Company's ratings, the Company's ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance;
* · if actual claims exceed the Company's claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or if changes in the estimated level of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are necessary, including as a result of, among other things, changes in the legal/tort, regulatory and economic environments in which the Company operates, including increased inflation, the Company's financial results could be materially and adversely affected;
* · the Company's business could be harmed because of its potential exposure to asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation;
* · the Company is exposed to, and may face adverse developments involving, mass tort claims such as those relating to exposure to potentially harmful products or substances; and
* · the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on the Company's business are uncertain, and court decisions or legislative changes that take place after the Company issues its policies can result in an unexpected increase in the number of claims and have a material adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and/or the Company's financial position.

* · the intense competition that the Company faces, including with respect to attracting and retaining employees, and the impact of innovation, technological change and changing customer preferences on the insurance industry and the markets in which it operates, could harm its ability to maintain or increase its business volumes and its profitability;
* · disruptions to the Company's relationships with its independent agents and brokers or the Company's inability to manage effectively a changing distribution landscape could adversely affect the Company;
* · the Company's efforts to develop new products or services, expand in targeted markets, improve business processes and workflows or make acquisitions may not be successful and may create enhanced risks;
* · the Company may be adversely affected if its pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results;
* · loss of or significant restrictions on the use of particular types of underwriting criteria, such as credit scoring, or other data or methodologies, in the pricing and underwriting of the Company's products could reduce the Company's future profitability;
* · the Company is subject to additional risks associated with its business outside the United States; and
* · future pandemics (including new variants of COVID-19) could materially affect the Company's results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.

Technology and Intellectual Property Risks
------------------------------------------

* · if, as a result of cyber attacks (the risk of which could be exacerbated by geopolitical tensions) or otherwise, the Company experiences difficulties with technology, data and network security, outsourcing relationships or cloud-based technology, the Company's ability to conduct its business could be negatively impacted;
* · the Company's business success and profitability depend, in part, on effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in technology, including with respect to artificial intelligence, particularly as its business processes become more digital; and
* · intellectual property is important to the Company's business, and the Company may be unable to protect and enforce its own intellectual property or the Company may be subject to claims for infringing the intellectual property of others.

Regulatory and Compliance Risks
-------------------------------

* · the Company's businesses are heavily regulated by the states and countries in which it conducts business, including licensing, market conduct and financial supervision, and changes in regulation, including changes in tax regulation, may reduce the Company's profitability and limit its growth; and
* · the Company could be adversely affected if its controls designed to ensure compliance with guidelines, policies and legal and regulatory standards are not effective.

In addition, the Company's share repurchase plans depend on a variety of factors, including the Company's financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels appropriate for the Company's business operations, changes in levels of written premiums, funding of the Company's qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the Company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and

acquisitions and related financings), market conditions, changes in tax laws (including the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022) and other factors.

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
------------------------------------------------------------------

For the Company's disclosures about market risk, please see "Part II-Item 7A-Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in the Company's 2023 Annual Report filed with the SEC. There have been no material changes to the Company's disclosures about market risk in Part II-Item 7A of the Company's 2023 Annual Report.

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
-------------------------------

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2024. Consistent with guidance issued by the SEC that an assessment of internal controls over financial reporting of a recently acquired business may be omitted from management's evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, management is excluding an assessment of such internal controls for Corvus Insurance Holdings, Inc. (Corvus) from its evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. The Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Corvus on January 2, 2024. Corvus represented less than 1% of the Company's consolidated total assets, consolidated total revenues and net income as of and for the quarter ended June 30, 2024. Based upon that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of June 30, 2024, the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level.

In addition, there was no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The Company is in the process of reviewing the internal control structure of Corvus and, if necessary, will make appropriate changes as it integrates Corvus into the Company's overall internal control over financial reporting process.

The Company regularly seeks to identify, develop and implement improvements to its technology systems and business processes, some of which may affect its internal control over financial reporting. These changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems or platforms, automating manual processes or utilizing technology developed by third parties. These systems changes are often phased in over multiple periods in order to limit the implementation risk in any one period, and as each change is implemented the Company monitors its effectiveness as part of its internal control over financial reporting.

The most recent authorization was approved by the Board of Directors on April 19, 2023 and added $5.0 billion of repurchase capacity to the $1.60 billion of capacity remaining at that date. The authorizations do not have a stated expiration date. The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company's financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels appropriate for the Company's business operations, changes in levels of written premiums, funding of the Company's qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the Company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions and related financings), market conditions, changes in tax laws (including the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022) and other factors. The cost of treasury stock acquired pursuant to common share repurchases includes the 1% excise tax imposed on common share repurchase activity, net of common share issuances, as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

The Company acquired 12,170 shares for a total cost of $3 million during the three months ended June 30, 2024 that were not part of its publicly announced share repurchase authorizations. These shares consisted of shares retained to cover payroll withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of restricted stock unit awards and performance share awards, and shares used by employees to cover the exercise price, as well as the related payroll withholding taxes, with respect to certain stock options that were exercised.
