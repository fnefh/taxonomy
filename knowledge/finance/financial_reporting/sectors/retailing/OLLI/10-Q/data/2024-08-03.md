<p>Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023</p>
<p>(Unaudited)</p>
<h2>(1) Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</h2>
<h2>(a) Description of Business</h2>
<p>Ollie's Bargain Outlet Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the "Company" or "Ollie's") principally buys overproduced, overstocked, and closeout merchandise from manufacturers, wholesalers, and other retailers. In addition, the Company augments its name-brand closeout deals with directly sourced private label products featuring names exclusive to Ollie's in order to provide consistently value-priced goods in select key merchandise categories.</p>
<p>Since its first store opened in 1982, the Company has grown to525 retail locations in 31 states as of August 3, 2024. Ollie's Bargain Outlet retail locations a r e located in Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Wisconsin, and West Virginia.</p>
<h2>(b) Fiscal Year</h2>
<p>Ollie's follows a 52/53-week fiscal year, which ends on the Saturday nearer to January 31$^{st}$ of the following calendar year. References to the thirteen weeks ended August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023 refer to the thirteen weeks from May 5, 2024 to August 3, 2024 and from April 30, 2023 to July 29, 2023, respectively. References to the year-to-date periods ended August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023 refer to the twenty-six weeks from February 4, 2024 to August 3, 2024 and from January 29, 2023 to July 29, 2023, respectively. References to "2023" refer to the fiscal year ended February 3, 2024 and references to "2024" refer to the fiscal year ending February 1, 2025. Fiscal year 2023 consists of 53 weeks, and fiscal year 2024 consists of 52 weeks.</p>
<h2>(c) Basis of Presentation</h2>
<p>The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for interim financial information and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") regarding interim financial reporting. The condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments which management believes are necessary to present fairly the Company's results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows for all periods presented. The condensed consolidated balance sheets as of August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023, and the condensed consolidated statements of income and stockholders' equity for the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023, and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023 have been prepared by the Company and are unaudited. The Company's business is seasonal in nature and results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of operating results for 2024 or any other period. All intercompany accounts, transactions, and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.</p>
<p>The Company's balance sheet as of February 3, 2024, presented herein, has been derived from the audited balance sheet included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 27, 2024 ("Annual Report"), but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements for 2023 and footnotes thereto included in the Annual Report.</p>
<p>For purposes of the disclosure requirements for segments of a business enterprise, it has been determined that the Company is comprised ofone operating segment.</p>
<h2>(d) Use of Estimates</h2>
<p>The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.</p>

<p>(Unaudited)</p>
<h2>(e) Fair Value Disclosures</h2>
<p>Fair value is defined as the price which the Company would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. In determining fair value, GAAP establishes a three-level hierarchy used in measuring fair value, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Level 1 inputs are quoted prices available for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.</li>
<li>· Level 2 inputs are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.</li>
<li>· Level 3 inputs are unobservable, developed using the Company's estimates and assumptions, which reflect those that market participants would use.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Company's financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, investment securities, accounts receivable, accounts payable and the Company's credit facilities. The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable are representative of their respective fair value because of their short-term nature. The carrying amount of the Company's credit facilities approximates its fair value because the interest rates are adjusted regularly based on current market conditions. Un der the fair value hierarchy, the fair market values of cash equivalents and the investments in treasury bonds and corporate bonds are Level 1 while the investments in municipal bonds are Level 2. Since quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are not available, these prices are determined by the third-party pricing service using observable market information such as quotes from less active markets and quoted prices of similar securities.</p>
<p>As of August 3, 2024, February 3, 2024, and July 29, 2023, the Company's investment securities are classified as held-to-maturity since the Company has the intent and ability to hold the investments to maturity.

<h2>(2) Net Sales</h2>
<p>Ollie's recognizes retail sales in its stores when merchandise is sold and the customer takes possession of merchandise. Also included in net sales is revenue allocated to certain redeemed discounts earned via the Ollie's Army loyalty program and gift card breakage. Net sales are presented net of returns and sales tax. The Company provides an allowance for estimated retail merchandise returns based on prior experience.</p>
<h2>Revenue Recognition</h2>
<p>Revenue is deferred for the Ollie's Army loyalty program where members accumulate points that can be redeemed for discounts on future purchases. The Company has determined it has an additional performance obligation to Ollie's Army members at the time of the initial transaction. The Company allocates the transaction price to the initial transaction and the discount awards based upon its relative standalone selling price, which considers historical redemption patterns for the award. Revenue is recognized as those discount awards are redeemed. Discount awards issued upon the achievement of specified point levels are subject to expiration. Unless temporarily extended, the maximum redemption period is 45 days. At the end of each fiscal period, unredeemed discount awards and accumulated points to earn a future discount award are reflected as a liability. Discount awards are combined in one homogeneous pool and are not separately identifiable. Therefore, the revenue recognized consists of discount awards redeemed that were included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period as well as discount awards issued during the current period. The following table is a reconciliation of the liability related to this program:</p>

<p>Gift card breakage for gift card liabilities not subject to escheatment is recognized as revenue in proportion to the redemption of gift cards. Gift cards do not expire. The rate applied to redemptions is based upon a historical breakage rate. Gift cards are combined in one homogenous pool and are not separately identifiable. Therefore, the revenue recognized consists of gift cards that were included in the liability at the beginning of the period as well as gift cards that were issued during the period.

<h2>(3) Earnings per Common Share</h2>
<p>Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding after giving effect to the potential dilution, if applicable, from the assumed exercise of stock options into shares of common stock as if those stock options were exercised and the assumed lapse of restrictions on restricted stock units.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes those effects for the diluted earnings per common share calculation:</p>

| Weighted average number of common shares outstanding - Basic | 61,313 | 61,768 | 61,347 | 61,869 |
| Incremental shares from the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options and vesting of restricted stock units | 408 | 287 | 384 | 262 |

| Earnings per common share - Diluted | $ 0.79 | $ 0.68 | $ 1.54 | $ 1.18 |</p>
<p>The effect of the weighted average assumed exercise of stock options outstanding totaling 298,237 and 515,627 for the thirteen weeks ended August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively, and 408,987 and 678,573 for the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted average common shares outstanding because the effect would have been antidilutive.</p>
<p>The effect of weighted average non-vested restricted stock units outstanding totaling 445 and 19,897 for the thirteen weeks ended August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively, and 246 and 23,069 for the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted average common shares outstanding because the effect would have been antidilutive.</p>

<h2>(4) Leases</h2>
<p>Effective February 3, 2019, the Company accounts for its leases under ASC 842, Leases (Topic 842). Under this guidance, arrangements meeting the definition of a lease are classified as operating or financing leases and are recorded on the balance sheet as both a right-of-use asset and lease liability, calculated by discounting fixed lease payments over the lease term at the rate implicit in the lease, if available. The Company's lessors do not provide an implicit rate, nor is one readily available, therefore the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the portfolio approach, which applies one rate to leases within a given period. Lease liabilities are increased by interest and reduced by payments each period, and the right-of-use asset is amortized over the lease term. For operating leases, interest on the lease liability and the amortization of the right-of-use asset result in straight-line rent expense over the lease term. Variable lease expenses, if any, are recorded when incurred.</p>
<p>In calculating the right-of-use asset and lease liability, the Company elects to combine lease and non-lease components. The Company excludes short-term leases having initial terms of 12 months or less from the guidance as an accounting policy election and recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company does not act as a lessor.</p>
<p>Ollie's generally leases its stores, offices, and distribution facilities under operating leases that expire at various dates through 2035. These leases generally provide for fixed annual rentals; however, several provide for minimum annual rentals plus contingent rentals based on a percentage of annual sales. A majority of the Company's leases also require a payment for all or a portion of common-area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes, water and sewer costs, and repairs, on a fixed or variable payment basis, the cost of which, for leases existing as of the adoption of ASC 842, is charged to the related expense category rather than being accounted for as rent expense. For leases entered into after the adoption of ASC 842, the Company accounts for lease components together with non-lease components as a single component for all classes of underlying assets. Most of the leases contain options to renew for three to five successive five-year periods. The Company is generally not reasonably certain to exercise renewal options; therefore, the options are not considered in determining the lease term, and associated potential option payments are excluded from the lease payments. Ollie's lease agreements generally do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.</p>
<p>Store and office lease costs are classified in selling, general, and administrative expenses and distribution center lease costs are classified in cost of sales on the condensed consolidated statements of income.</p>

<h2>(7) Debt Obligations and Financing Arrangements</h2>
<p>Long-term debt consists of finance leases.</p>
<p>The Company's credit facility (the "Credit Facility") provides for a five-year $100.0 million revolving credit facility, which includes a $45.0 million sub-facility for letters of credit and a $25.0 million sub-facility for swingline loans (the "Revolving Credit Facility"). In addition, the Company may at any time add term loan facilities or additional revolving commitments up to $150.0 million pursuant to terms and conditions set out in the Credit Facility. On January 9, 2024, the Company refinanced its credit facility (the "Credit Facility"), pursuant to which the maturity date for any loans under the revolving credit facility was extended for a period of five years from the effective date of January 9, 2024 and a zero percent (0.0%) interest rate floor was added to the option for the SOFR Loan Rate (as defined in the Amendment). Loans under the Revolving Credit Facility mature on January 9, 2029.</p>
<p>As a result of the anticipated discontinuation of LIBOR in 2023, on January 24, 2023, the Company amended its Credit Facility to replace the LIBOR-based interest rates included therein with SOFR-based interest rates and to modify the provisions for determining an alternative rate of interest upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the availability of interest rate benchmarks. The interest rates for the Credit Facility are calculated as follows: for ABR Loans, the highest of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 0.50% and Term SOFR with a term of one-month in effect on such day plus the SOFR Spread Adjustment plus 1.0%, plus the Applicable Margin, or, for SOFR Loans, the SOFR Loan Rate plus the Applicable Margin plus the SOFR Spread Adjustment. The Applicable Margin will vary from 0.00% to 0.50% for an ABR Loan and 1.00% to 1.50% for a SOFR Loan, based on availability under the Credit Facility. The SOFR Loan Rate is subject to a 0% floor.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the Revolving Credit Facility, as of August 3, 2024, the Company could borrow up to 90.0% of the most recent appraised value (valued at cost, discounted for the current net orderly liquidation value) of its eligible inventory, as defined, up to $100.0 million.</p>
<p>As of August 3, 2024, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, with $89.0 million of borrowing availability, outstanding letters of credit commitments of $10.7 million and $0.2 million of rent reserves. The Revolving Credit Facility also contains a variable unused line fee ranging from 0.125% to 0.250% per annum.</p>
<p>The Credit Facility is collateralized by the Company's assets and equity and contains a financial covenant, as well as certain business covenants, including restrictions on dividend payments, which the Company must comply with during the term of the agreement. The financial covenant is a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio test of at least 1.0 to 1.0 applicable during a covenant period, based on reference to availability. The Company was in compliance with all terms of the Credit Facility during the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024.</p>
<p>The provisions of the Credit Facility restrict all of the net assets of the Company's consolidated subsidiaries, which constitutes all of the net assets on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of August 3, 2024, from being used to pay any dividends or make other restricted payments to the Company without prior written consent from the financial institutions that are a party to the Credit Facility, subject to material exceptions including pro forma compliance with the applicable conditions described in the Credit Facility.</p>
<h2>(8) Income Taxes</h2>
<p>The effective tax rates for the thirteen weeks ended August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023 were24.3% and 24.6%, respectively.</p>
<p>The effective tax rates for the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023 were24.0% and 24.7%, respectively.</p>

<p>The Company is subject to tax in the United States. The Company files a consolidated U.S. income tax return for federal income tax purposes. The Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations by U.S. federal, or state and local tax authorities for tax years 2018 and prior.</p>
<p>Management believes that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues arise as a result of a tax audit, and are resolved in a manner not consistent with management's expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs.</p>
<h2>(9) Equity Incentive Plans</h2>
<p>During fiscal 2012, Ollie's established an equity incentive plan (the "2012 Plan"), under which stock options were granted to executive officers and key employees as deemed appropriate under the provisions of the 2012 Plan, with an exercise price at the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. The vesting period for options granted under the 2012 Plan is five years (20% ratably per year). Options granted under the 2012 Plan are subject to employment for vesting, expire 10 years from the date of grant, and are not transferable other than upon death. As of July 15, 2015, the date of the pricing of the Company's initial public offering, no additional equity grants will be made under the 2012 Plan.</p>
<p>In connection with its initial public offering, the Company adopted the 2015 equity incentive plan (the "2015 Plan") pursuant to which the Company's Board of Directors may grant stock options, restricted shares, or other awards to employees, directors and consultants. The 2015 Plan allows for the issuance of up to 5,250,000 shares. Awards will be made pursuant to agreements and may be subject to vesting and other restrictions as determined by the Board of Directors or the Compensation Committee of the Board. The Company uses authorized and unissued shares to satisfy share award exercises. As of August 3, 2024, there were 1,670,602 shares available for grant under the 2015 Plan.</p>
<h2>Stock Options</h2>
<p>The exercise price for stock options is determined at the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. The vesting period for awards granted under the 2015 Plan is generally set at four years (25% ratably per year). Awards are subject to employment for vesting, expire 10 years from the date of grant, and are not transferable other than upon death.</p>
<p>A summary of the Company's stock option activity and related information for thetwe nty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 follows:</p>

<p>The weighted average grant date fair value per option for options granted during thetwenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023 was $39.27 and $29.07, respectively. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that used the weighted average assumptions in the following table:</p>
<p>| | Twenty-six weeks ended | Twenty-six weeks ended |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | August 3, 2024 | July 29, 2023 |
| Risk-free interest rate | 4.27 % | 3.36 % |
| Expected dividend yield | - | - |
| Expected life (years) | 6.25 years | 6.25 years |
| Expected volatility | 47.63% | 47.16% |</p>
<p>The expected life of stock options is estimated using the "simplified method," as the Company does not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior for its stock option grants. The simplified method is based on the average of the vesting tranches and the contractual life of each grant. For expected volatility, the Company uses its historical information over the expected life of the option granted to calculate the fair value of option grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury notes with a term approximating the expected life of the option.</p>
<h2>Restricted Stock Units</h2>
<p>Restricted stock units ("RSUs") are issued at the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. RSUs outstanding vest ratably over four years or cliff vest in one or four years. Awards are subject to employment for vesting and are not transferable other than upon death.</p>
<p>A summary of the Company's RSU activity and related information for thetwe nty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 is as follows:</p>
<p>| | Number of shares | Weighted average grant date fair value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Non-vested balance at February 3, 2024 | 350,804 | $ 53.94 |
| Granted | 172,232 | 74.79 |
| Forfeited | (6,790 ) | 58.79 |
| Vested | (116,047) | 54.02 |
| Non-vested balance at August 3, 2024 | 400,199 | 62.80 |</p>
<h2>Stock-Based Compensation Expense</h2>
<p>The compensation cost for stock options and RSUs which have been recorded within selling, general, and administrative expenses related to the Company's equity incentive plans was $3.7 million and $3.1 million for the thirteen weeks ended August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023, respectively, and $6.8 million and $6.0 million for the t wenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 a nd July 29, 2023, respectively.</p>
<p>As of August 3, 2024, there was $32.7 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock-based compensation arrangements. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.8 years. Compensation costs related to awards are recognized using the straight-line method.</p>
<h2>(10) Common Stock</h2>
<h2>Common Stock</h2>
<p>The Company's capital structure consists of a single class of common stock withone vote per share. The Company has authorized 500,000,000 shares at $0.001 par value per share. Additionally, the Company has authorized 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock at $0.001 per value per share; to date, however, no preferred shares have been issued. Treasury stock, which consists of the Company's common stock, is accounted for using the cost method.</p>
<h2>Share Repurchase Program</h2>
<p>On December 15, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of shares of the Company's common stock. On March 16, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized an increase of $100.0 million in the Company's share repurchase program. Both of these authorizations were authorized to be executed through January 2023. On November 30, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized an additional $200.0 million to repurchase stock pursuant to the Company's share repurchase program, expiring on December 15, 2023. On November 30, 2023, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized an extension to the existing share repurchase program set to expire on December 15, 2023, until March 31, 2026.</p>
<p>The shares to be repurchased may be purchased from time to time in open market transactions (including blocks), privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs or other derivative transactions, issuer self-tender offers, or any combination of the foregoing. The timing of repurchases and the actual amount purchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of the Company's shares, general market, economic and business conditions, and other corporate considerations. Repurchases may be made pursuant to plans intended to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which could allow the Company to purchase its shares during periods when it otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. Repurchases are expected to be funded from cash on hand or through the utilization of the Company's Revolving Credit Facility. The repurchase authorization does not require the purchase of a specific number of shares and is subject to suspension or termination by the Company's Board of Directors at any time. During the t wenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024, the Company repurchased 418,274 shares of its common stock for $31.4 million, inclusive of transaction costs, pursuant to its share repurchase program. These expenditures were funded by cash on hand. As of August 3, 2024, the Company had $54.2 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization.

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Ollie's is a highly differentiated and fast-growing, extreme value retailer of brand name merchandise at drastically reduced prices. Known for our assortment of products offered as "Good Stuff Cheap," we offer customers a broad selection of brand name products, including housewares, bed and bath, food, floor coverings, health and beauty aids, books and stationery, toys, and electronics. Our differentiated go-to market strategy is characterized by a unique, fun and engaging treasure hunt shopping experience, compelling customer value proposition and witty, humorous in-store signage and advertising campaigns.</p>
<h2>Our Growth Strategy</h2>
<p>Since the founding of Ollie's in 1982, we have grown organically by backfilling existing markets and leveraging our brand awareness, marketing and infrastructure to expand into new markets in contiguous states. We have expanded to 525 stores located in 31 states as of August 3, 2024.</p>
<p>Our stores are supported by four distribution centers, one each in York, PA, Commerce, GA, Lancaster, TX, and Princeton, IL. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company acquired land in Princeton, IL, for the construction of its fourth distribution center and broke ground on construction of our 615,000 square feet facility in April 2023. We completed the construction of the Princeton, IL distribution center in the second quarter of 2024 and began shipping product in July 2024. With the addition of our fourth distribution center, we believe our distribution capabilities will support up to 750 stores.</p>
<p>We have invested in our associates, infrastructure, distribution network and information systems to allow us to continue to rapidly grow our store footprint, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>· growing our merchant buying team to increase our access to brand name/closeout merchandise;</li>
<li>· adding members to our senior management team;</li>
<li>· expanding the capacity of our distribution centers to their current 2.4 million square feet and constructing a fourth distribution center in Princeton, IL; and</li>
<li>· investing in information technology, accounting, and warehouse management systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our business model has produced consistent and predictable store growth over the past several years, during both strong and weaker economic cycles. We plan to continue to enhance our competitive positioning and drive growth in sales and profitability by executing on the following strategies:</p>
<ul>
<li>· growing our store base;</li>
<li>· increasing our offerings of great bargains; and</li>
<li>· leveraging and expanding Ollie's Army.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have a proven portable, flexible, and highly profitable store model that has produced consistent financial results and returns. Our new store model targets a store size between 25,000 to 35,000 square feet and an average initial cash investment of approximately $1.0 million, which includes store fixtures and equipment, store-level and distribution center inventory (net of payables), and pre-opening expenses. We target new store sales of approximately $4.0 million in their first full year of operations.</p>
<h2>Index</h2>
<p>While we are focused on driving comparable store sales and managing our expenses, our revenue and profitability growth will primarily come from opening new stores. The core elements of our business model are procuring great deals, offering extreme values to our customers and creating consistent, predictable store growth and margins. In addition, our new stores generally open strong, immediately contributing to the growth in net sales and profitability of our business. We plan to achieve continued net sales growth, including comparable stores sales, by adding stores to our store base and by continuing to provide quality merchandise at a value for our customers as we scale and gain more access to purchase directly from major manufacturers. We also plan to leverage and expand our Ollie's Army database marketing strategies. In addition, we plan to continue to manage our selling, general, and administrative expenses ("SG&amp;A") by continuing to make process improvements and by maintaining our strong expense control discipline.</p>
<p>Our ability to grow and our results of operations may be impacted by additional factors and uncertainties, such as consumer spending habits, which are subject to macroeconomic conditions and changes in discretionary income. Our customers' discretionary income is primarily impacted by gas prices, wages, rising interest rates, and consumer trends and preferences, which fluctuate depending on the environment. The potential consolidation of our competitors or other changes in our competitive landscape could also impact our results of operations or our ability to grow, even though we compete with a broad range of retailers.</p>
<p>Our key competitive advantage is our direct buying relationships with many major manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, brokers, and retailers for our brand name closeout products and unbranded goods. We also augment our product mix with private label brands. As we continue to grow, we believe our increased scale will provide us with even greater access to brand name closeout products as major manufacturers seek a single buyer to acquire an entire deal.</p>
<h2>How We Assess the Performance of Our Business and Key Line Items</h2>
<p>We consider a variety of financial and operating measures in assessing the performance of our business. The key measures we use are number of new stores, net sales, comparable store sales, gross profit and gross margin, SG&amp;A, pre-opening expenses, operating income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA.</p>
<h2>Number of New Stores</h2>
<p>The number of new stores reflects the number of stores opened during a particular reporting period. Before we open new stores, we incur pre-opening expenses described below under "Pre-Opening Expenses" and we make an initial investment in inventory. We also make initial capital investments in fixtures and equipment, which we amortize over time.</p>
<p>We expect new store growth to be the primary driver of our sales growth. Our initial lease terms are approximately seven years with options to renew for three to five successive five-year periods. Our portable and predictable real estate model focuses on backfilling existing markets and entering new markets in contiguous states. Our new stores often open with higher sales levels as a result of greater advertising and promotional spend in connection with grand opening events, but decline shortly thereafter to our new store model levels.</p>
<h2>Net Sales</h2>
<p>Ollie's recognizes retail sales in its stores when merchandise is sold and the customer takes possession of the merchandise. Also included in net sales is revenue allocated to certain redeemed discounts earned via the Ollie's Army loyalty program and gift card breakage. Net sales are presented net of returns and sales tax. Net sales consist of sales from comparable stores and non-comparable stores, described below under "Comparable Store Sales." Growth of our net sales is primarily driven by expansion of our store base in existing and new markets. As we continue to grow, we believe we will have greater access to brand name closeout merchandise and an increased deal selection, resulting in more potential offerings for our customers. Net sales are impacted by product mix, merchandise mix and availability, as well as promotional activities and the spending habits of our customers. Our broad selection of offerings across diverse product categories supports growth in net sales by attracting new customers, which results in higher spending levels and frequency of shopping visits from our customers, including Ollie's Army members.</p>
<h2>Index</h2>
<p>The spending habits of our customers are subject to macroeconomic conditions and changes in discretionary income. Our customers' discretionary income is primarily impacted by gas prices, wages, inflation, and consumer trends and preferences, which fluctuate depending on the environment. However, because we offer a broad selection of merchandise at extreme values, we believe we are less impacted than other retailers by economic cycles that correspond with declines in general consumer spending habits. We believe we also benefit from periods of increased consumer spending.</p>
<h2>Comparable Store Sales</h2>
<p>Comparable store sales measure performance of a store during the current reporting period against the performance of the same store in the corresponding period of the previous year. Comparable store sales consist of net sales from our stores beginning on the first day of the sixteenth full fiscal month following the store's opening, which is when we believe comparability is achieved. Comparable store sales are impacted by the same factors that impact net sales.</p>
<p>We define comparable stores to be stores that:</p>
<ul>
<li>· have been remodeled while remaining open;</li>
<li>· are closed for five or fewer days in any fiscal month;</li>
<li>· are closed temporarily and relocated within their respective trade areas; and</li>
<li>· have expanded, but are not significantly different in size, within their current locations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Non-comparable store sales consist of new store sales and sales for stores not open for a full 15 months. Stores which are closed temporarily, but for more than five days in any fiscal month, are included in non-comparable store sales beginning in the fiscal month in which the temporary closure begins until the first full month of operation once the store re-opens, at which time they are included in comparable store sales.</p>
<p>Opening new stores is the primary component of our growth strategy and as we continue to execute on our growth strategy, we expect a significant portion of our sales growth will be attributable to non-comparable store sales. Accordingly, comparable store sales are only one measure we use to assess the success of our growth strategy.</p>
<h2>Gross Profit and Gross Margin</h2>
<p>Gross profit is equal to our net sales less our cost of sales. Cost of sales includes merchandise costs, inventory markdowns, shrinkage and transportation, distribution and warehousing costs, including depreciation. Gross margin is gross profit as a percentage of our net sales. Gross margin is a measure used by management to indicate whether we are selling merchandise at an appropriate gross profit.</p>
<p>In addition, our gross margin is impacted by product mix, as some products generally provide higher gross margins, by our merchandise mix and availability, and by our merchandise cost, which can vary.</p>
<p>Our gross profit is variable in nature and generally follows changes in net sales. We regularly analyze the components of gross profit, as well as gross margin. Specifically, our product margin and merchandise mix is reviewed by our merchant team and senior management, ensuring strict adherence to internal margin goals. Our disciplined buying approach has produced consistent gross margins and we believe helps to mitigate adverse impacts on gross profit and results of operation.</p>
<p>The components of our cost of sales may not be comparable to the components of cost of sales or similar measures of our competitors and other retailers. As a result, our gross profit and gross margin may not be comparable to similar data made available by our competitors and other retailers.</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<h2>Index</h2>
<h2>Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses</h2>
<p>SG&amp;A are comprised of payroll and benefits for store, field support, and support center associates. SG&amp;A also include marketing and advertising expense, occupancy costs for stores and the store support center, insurance, corporate infrastructure, and other general expenses. The components of our SG&amp;A remain relatively consistent per store and for each new store opening. The components of our SG&amp;A may not be comparable to the components of similar measures of other retailers. Consolidated SG&amp;A generally increase as we grow our store base and as our net sales increase. A significant portion of our expenses is primarily fixed in nature, and we expect to continue to maintain strict discipline while carefully monitoring SG&amp;A as a percentage of net sales. We expect that our SG&amp;A will continue to increase in future periods with future growth.</p>
<h2>Depreciation and Amortization Expenses</h2>
<p>Property and equipment are stated at original cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses are calculated over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, or in the case of leasehold improvements, the lesser of the useful lives or the remaining term of the lease. Expenditures for additions, renewals, and betterments are capitalized; expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are computed on the straight-line method for financial reporting purposes. Depreciation as it relates to our distribution centers is included within cost of sales on the condensed consolidated statements of income.</p>
<h2>Pre-Opening Expenses</h2>
<p>Pre-opening expenses consist of expenses of opening new stores and distribution centers, as well as store remodel and closing costs. For opening new stores, preopening expenses include grand opening advertising costs, payroll expenses, travel expenses, employee training costs, rent expenses, and store setup costs. Preopening expenses for new stores are expensed as they are incurred, which is typically within 30 to 45 days of opening a new store. For opening distribution centers, pre-opening expenses primarily include inventory transportation costs, employee travel expenses, and occupancy costs. Store remodel costs primarily consist of payroll expenses, travel expenses, and store setup costs expensed as they are incurred. Store closing costs primarily consist of insurance deductibles, rent, and store payroll.</p>
<h2>Operating Income</h2>
<p>Operating income is gross profit less SG&amp;A, depreciation and amortization, and pre-opening expenses. Operating income excludes net interest income or expense, and income tax expense or benefit. We use operating income as an indicator of the productivity of our business and our ability to manage expenses.</p>
<h2>EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA</h2>
<p>EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are key metrics used by management and our Board to assess our financial performance. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are also frequently used by analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry. We use Adjusted EBITDA to supplement U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, to evaluate our performance in connection with compensation decisions and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. Management believes it is useful to investors and analysts to evaluate these non-GAAP measures on the same basis as management uses to evaluate the Company's operating results. We believe that excluding items from operating income, net income and net income per diluted share that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, our core operating results, and that may vary in frequency or magnitude, enhances the comparability of our results and provides a better baseline for analyzing trends in our business.</p>
<h2>Index</h2>
<p>We define EBITDA as net income before net interest income or expense, depreciation and amortization expenses and income taxes. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as further adjusted for non-cash stock-based compensation expense. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similar measures reported by other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. In the future we may incur expenses or charges such as those added back to calculate Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these items. For further discussion of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and for reconciliations of net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, see "Results of Operations."</p>
<h2>Factors Affecting the Comparability of our Results of Operations</h2>
<p>Our results over the past two years have been affected by the following factors, which must be understood in order to assess the comparability of our period-toperiod financial performance and condition.</p>
<h2>Historical Results</h2>
<p>Historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period.</p>
<h2>Store Openings and Closings</h2>
<p>We opened 9 new stores in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and opened 6 new stores in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. We opened 13 new stores in the twentysix weeks ended August 3, 2024 and opened 15 new stores and closed one store in the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023.</p>
<h2>Seasonality</h2>
<p>Our business is seasonal in nature and demand is generally the highest in our fourth fiscal quarter due to the holiday sales season. To prepare for the holiday sales season, we must order and keep in stock more merchandise than we carry during other times of the year and generally engage in additional marketing efforts. We expect inventory levels, along with accounts payable and accrued expenses, to reach their highest levels in our third and fourth fiscal quarters in anticipation of increased net sales during the holiday sales season. As a result of this seasonality, and generally because of variation in consumer spending habits, we experience fluctuations in net sales and working capital requirements during the year. Because we offer a broad selection of merchandise at extreme values, we believe we are less impacted than other retailers by economic cycles which correspond with declines in general consumer spending habits, and we believe we still benefit from periods of increased consumer spending.</p>

<h2>Second Quarter of Fiscal 2024 Compared to Second Quarter of Fiscal 2023</h2>
<h2>Net Sales</h2>
<p>Net sales increased to $578.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 from $514.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, an increase of $63.9 million, or 12.4%. The increase was the result of a non-comparable store sales increase of $34.9 million and an increase in comparable store sales of $29.0 million. The increase in non-comparable store sales was driven by new store unit growth.</p>
<p>Comparable store sales increased 5.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with a 7.9% increase in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The increase in comparable store sales primarily consisted of an increase in average transaction size and an increase in the number of transactions.</p>
<h2>Gross Profit and Gross Margin</h2>
<p>Gross profit increased to $219.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 from $196.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, an increase of $22.3 million, or 11.4%. Gross margin decreased 30 basis points to 37.9% in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 from 38.2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The decrease in gross margin in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 is primarily due to a slightly lower merchandise margin due to changes in product mix.</p>
<h2>Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses</h2>
<p>SG&amp;A increased to $145.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 from $134.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, an increase of $11.1 million, or 8.2%, primarily driven by higher selling expenses related to new store openings. As a percentage of net sales, SG&amp;A decreased 100 basis points to 25.2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to 26.2% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily the result of leverage of fixed expenses on the increase in comparable store sales and disciplined expense control.</p>
<h2>Pre-Opening Expenses</h2>
<p>Pre-opening expenses increased to $4.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 from $2.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023 due to costs associated with the startup of the Company's fourth distribution center in Princeton, IL as well as the comparative number of new stores. We opened 9 and 6 new stores in the second quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. As a percentage of net sales, pre-opening expenses increased to 0.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 from 0.6% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.</p>
<h2>Index</h2>
<h2>Interest Income, Net</h2>
<p>Interest income, net increased to $3.9 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared with $3.4 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, primarily due to favorable interest rates and higher average cash and cash equivalent and short-term investments balances.</p>
<h2>Income Tax Expense</h2>
<p>Income tax expense increased to $15.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to $13.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The effective tax rates for the second quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 were 24.3% and 24.6%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was primarily due to an increase in discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Discrete tax benefits totaled $0.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 compared to discrete tax benefits of $0.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023.</p>
<h2>Net Income</h2>
<p>As a result of the foregoing, net income increased to $49.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 from $42.2 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, an increase of $6.8 million or 16.1%.</p>
<h2>Adjusted EBITDA</h2>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA increased to $74.5 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 from $64.0 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, an increase of $10.5 million, or 16.4%.</p>
<h2>Year-to-Date Fiscal 2024 Compared to Year-to-Date Fiscal 2023</h2>
<h2>Net Sales</h2>
<p>Net sales increased to $1.087 billion in the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 from $973.7 million in the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023, an increase of $113.5 million, or 11.7%. The increase was the result of a non-comparable store sales increase of $70.7 million and an increase in comparable store sales of $42.8 million. The increase in non-comparable store sales was driven by new store unit growth.</p>
<p>Comparable store sales increased 4.5% in the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 compared with a 6.3% increase in the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023. The increase in comparable store sales primarily consisted of an increase in average transaction size and an increase in the number of transactions.</p>
<h2>Gross Profit and Gross Margin</h2>
<p>Gross profit increased to $428.4 million in the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 from $375.3 million in the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023. Gross margin increased 90 basis points to 39.4% in the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 from 38.5% in the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023. The increase in gross margin in the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 is primarily due to favorable supply chain costs as well as higher merchandise margins.</p>
<h2>Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses</h2>
<p>SG&amp;A increased to $288.1 million in the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 from $264.9 million in the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023, an increase of $23.2 million, or 8.8%, primarily driven by higher selling expenses related to new store openings. As a percentage of net sales, SG&amp;A decreased 70 basis points to 26.5% in the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 from 27.2% in the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023. The decrease was primarily the result of leverage of fixed expenses on the increase in comparable store sales and disciplined expense control.</p>
<h2>Pre-Opening Expenses</h2>
<p>Pre-opening expenses increased to $7.3 million in the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 from $6.2 million in the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023 primarily due to the costs associated with the startup of the Company's fourth distribution center in Princeton, IL as well as the comparative number of new stores. During the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024, we opened 13 new stores. During the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023, we opened 15 new stores and closed one store. As a percentage of net sales, pre-opening expenses increased 10 basis points to 0.7% in the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 from 0.6% in the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023.</p>
<h2>Index</h2>
<h2>Interest Income, Net</h2>
<p>Interest income, net increased to $8.2 million in the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 from $6.1 million in the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023, primarily due to favorable interest rates and higher average cash and cash equivalent and short-term investments balances.</p>
<h2>Income Tax Expense</h2>
<p>Income tax expense in the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 was $30.2 million compared to income tax expense of $24.0 million in the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023. The effective tax rates for the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 and July 29, 2023 were 24.0% and 24.7%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 was primarily due to an increase in discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Discrete tax benefits totaled $1.9 million in the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 compared to discrete tax benefits of $0.7 million in the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023.</p>
<h2>Net Income</h2>
<p>As a result of the foregoing, net income increased to $95.3 million in the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 from $73.2 million in the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023, an increase of $22.1 million or 30.3%.</p>
<h2>Adjusted EBITDA</h2>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA increased to $143.9 million in the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 from $113.4 million in the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023, an increase of $30.5 million, or 26.8%.</p>
<h2>Liquidity and Capital Resources</h2>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Our primary sources of liquidity are net cash flows provided by operating activities and available borrowings under our $100.0 million Revolving Credit Facility. Our primary cash needs are for capital expenditures and working capital. As of August 3, 2024, we had $89.0 million available to borrow under our Revolving Credit Facility and $353.1 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments on hand. For further information regarding our Revolving Credit Facility, see Note 7 under "Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements."</p>
<p>Our capital expenditures are primarily related to new store openings, store resets, which consist of improvements to stores as they are needed, expenditures related to our distribution centers, and infrastructure-related investments, including investments related to upgrading and maintaining our information technology systems. We spent $38.3 million and $26.2 million for capital expenditures during the second quarters of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. For the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024, we spent $65.2 million for capital expenditures compared to $45.2 million for the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023. Included in capital expenditures in the thirteen and twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024, is approximately $14.6 million for the acquisition of ten former 99 Cents Only Store locations. Of the ten store locations, three of these are owned properties and seven are leased properties with favorable rent and leasing structures, located in key markets across Texas. With the acquisition, we expect our total capital expenditures to be approximately $104 million, which includes the $14.6 million purchase price and build out costs for the newly acquired locations.</p>
<p>We expect to fund capital expenditures from cash on hand generated from operations. We opened 13 new stores during the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024, and we recently completed the construction of our Princeton, IL distribution center, which provides an additional 615,000 square feet of distribution capacity. We expect to open approximately 50 stores during fiscal 2024. We also expect to invest in store-level initiatives at our existing stores, and general corporate capital expenditures, including information technology. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, delays in construction and permitting of new stores and other projects.</p>
<h2>Index</h2>
<p>Our primary working capital requirements are for the purchase of merchandise inventories, payroll, store rent associated with our operating leases, other store operating costs, distribution costs, and general and administrative costs. Our working capital requirements fluctuate during the year, rising in our third fiscal quarter as we increase quantities of inventory in anticipation of our peak holiday sales season in our fourth fiscal quarter. Fluctuations in working capital are also driven by the timing of new store openings.</p>
<p>Historically, we have funded our capital expenditures and working capital requirements during the fiscal year with cash flows from operations.</p>
<p>A financial instrument which potentially subjects the Company to a concentration of credit risk is cash. Ollie's currently maintains its day-to-day operating cash balances with major financial institutions. The Company's operating cash balances are in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") insurance limit. From time to time, Ollie's invests temporary excess cash in overnight investments with expected minimal volatility, such as money market funds. Although the Company maintains balances which exceed the FDIC insured limit, it has not experienced any losses related to these balances.</p>
<p>We believe our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments position, net cash provided by operating activities and availability under our Revolving Credit Facility will be adequate to finance our planned capital expenditures, working capital requirements, debt service and other financing activities over the next 12 months. If cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility are not sufficient or available to meet our capital requirements, we will then be required to obtain additional equity or debt financing in the future. There can be no assurance equity or debt financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, the terms will be satisfactory to us and not dilutive to our then-current stockholders.</p>
<h2>Share Repurchase Program</h2>
<p>On December 15, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of shares of the Company's common stock. On March 16, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized an increase of $100.0 million in the Company's share repurchase program, resulting in $200.0 million approved for share repurchases through January 13, 2023. On November 30, 2021, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized an additional $200.0 million to repurchase stock pursuant to the Company's share repurchase program, expiring on December 15, 2023. On November 30, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an extension to the existing share repurchase program set to expire on December 15, 2023, until March 31, 2026. The shares to be repurchased may be purchased from time to time in open market conditions (including blocks) or in privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs or other derivative transactions, issuer self-tender offers or any combination of the foregoing. The timing of repurchases and the actual amount purchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of our shares, general market, economic, and business conditions, and other corporate considerations. Repurchases may be made pursuant to plans intended to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which could allow us to purchase our shares during periods when we otherwise might be prevented from doing so under insider trading laws or because of self-imposed trading blackout periods. Repurchases are expected to be funded from cash on hand or through the utilization of our Revolving Credit Facility. The repurchase authorization does not require the purchase of a specific number of shares and is subject to suspension or termination by our Board of Directors at any time.</p>
<p>During the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024, we repurchased 418,274 shares of our common stock for $31.4 million, inclusive of transaction costs, pursuant to our share repurchase program. During the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023, we repurchased 492,280 shares of our common stock for $29.0 million inclusive of transaction costs, pursuant to our share repurchase program. These expenditures were funded by cash generated from operations. As of August 3, 2024, we had $54.2 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization. There can be no assurances that any additional repurchases will be completed, or as to the timing or amount of any repurchases.</p>

<h2>Summary of Cash Flows</h2>
<p>A summary of our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities is presented in the following table:</p>
<p>| | Twenty-six weeks ended | Twenty-six weeks ended |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | August 3, 2024 | July 29, 2023 |
| | (in thousands) | (in thousands) |
| Net cash provided by operating activities | $ 84,059 | $ 109,765 |
| Net cash used in investing activities | (159,398) | (113,558) |
| Net cash used in financing activities | (20,323 ) | (25,387 ) |
| Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents | $ (95,662) | $ (29,180) |</p>
<h2>Cash Provided by Operating Activities</h2>
<p>Net cash provided by operating activities was $84.1 million for the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 as compared to $109.8 million for the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 was primarily due to changes in working capital, most notably the timing of inventory receipts and payments, including tax payments, partially offset by higher net income year over year.</p>
<h2>Cash Used in Investing Activities</h2>
<p>Net cash used in investing activities was $159.4 million for the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 as compared to $113.6 million for the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023. The increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to an increase in capital expenditures in the current year related to the completion of the Company's fourth distribution center in Princeton, IL and the acquisition of ten former 99 Cents Only Store locations, in addition to increased net investment of short-term investments twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 as compared to the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023.</p>
<h2>Cash Used in Financing Activities</h2>
<p>Net cash used in financing activities was $20.3 million for the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 as compared to $25.4 million for the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in the repurchase of common stock, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from stock option exercises in the twenty-six weeks ended August 3, 2024 as compared to the twenty-six weeks ended July 29, 2023.</p>
<h2>Contractual Obligations</h2>
<p>We enter into long-term contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business, primarily operating leases. Except as set forth in Note 4 of the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations as disclosed in our Annual Report, other than those which occur in the ordinary course of business.</p>
<h2>Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements</h2>
<p>We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.</p>
<h2>Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates</h2>
<p>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures.

<h2>ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK</h2>
<h2>Interest Rate Risk</h2>
<p>We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility, which bears interest at variable rates. As of August 3, 2024, we had no outstanding variable rate debt.</p>
<p>As of August 3, 2024, there were no material changes in the market risks described in the "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure of Market Risks" section of our Annual Report.</p>
<h2>Impact of Inflation</h2>
<p>Our results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our historical results of operations and financial condition have been immaterial. We cannot be assured that our results of operations and financial condition will not be materially impacted by inflation in the future.</p>
<h2>ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES</h2>
<h2>Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures</h2>
<p>Our management has evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13(a)-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) of the Exchange Act. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are effective at a reasonable assurance level in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is: (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported in a timely manner, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. While our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of their effectiveness, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.</p>
<h2>Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting</h2>
<p>There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting during the second quarter of fiscal 2024 that have materially affected, or that are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.</p>
