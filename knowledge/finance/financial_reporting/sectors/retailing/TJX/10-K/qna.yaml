      TJX operates as a leading off-price retailer with a flexible business
      model that supports opportunistic buying and inventory management. The

    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What are the key elements of TJX's off-price business strategy and
          what risks are associated with it?
        answer: TJX's off-price business strategy centers on opportunistic buying,

          prices, and in the right mix. If merchants don't make accurate
          assessments or execute the strategy effectively, it could adversely
