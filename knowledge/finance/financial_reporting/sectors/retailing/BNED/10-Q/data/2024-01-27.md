These programs have allowed us to reverse historical long-term trends in course materials revenue declines as the growth of our BNC First Day programs offsets declines in a la carte courseware sales and closed store sales. ®</p>
<p>We expect to continue to introduce scalable and advanced solutions focused largely on the student and customer experience, expand our e-commerce capabilities and accelerate such capabilities through our merchandising and e-commerce service provider agreement with Fanatics Retail Group Fulfillment, LLC, Inc. ("Fanatics") and Fanatics Lids College, Inc. D/B/A "Lids" ("Lids") (collectively referred to herein as the "F/L Relationship"), win new accounts, and expand our revenue opportunities through strategic relationships. We expect gross comparable store general merchandise sales to increase over the long term, as our product assortments continue to emphasize and reflect changing consumer trends, and we evolve our presentation concepts and merchandising of products in stores and online, which we expect to be further enhanced and accelerated through the F/L Relationship. Through this relationship, Fanatics and Lids provide unparalleled product assortment, ecommerce capabilities and powerful digital marketing tools on our behalf to drive increased value for customers and accelerate growth of our logo general merchandise business.</p>

<p>these assets related to our DSS Segment. We have two reportable segments: Retail and Wholesale. For additional information related to our strategies, operations and segments, see Part I - Item 1. Business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2023 .</p>
<h2>BNC First Day Equitable and Inclusive Access Programs</h2>
<p>We provide product and service offerings designed to address the most pressing issues in higher education, including equitable access, enhanced convenience and improved affordability through innovative course material delivery models designed to drive improved student experiences and outcomes. We offer our BNC First Day equitable and inclusive access programs, consisting of First Day Complete and First Day , which provide faculty required course materials on or before the first day of class at below market rates, as compared to the total retail price for the same course materials if purchased separately (a la carte) and students are billed the below market rate, directly by the institution as a course charge or included in tuition. ®</p>
<ul>
<li>· First Day Complete is adopted by an institution and includes the majority of undergraduate classes (and on occasion graduate classes), providing students both physical and digital materials. The First Day Complete model drives substantially greater unit sales and sell-through for the bookstore.</li>
<li>· First Day is adopted by a faculty member for a single course, and students receive primarily digital course materials through their school's learning management system ("LMS").</li>
</ul>
<p>Offering course materials through our equitable and inclusive access First Day Complete and First Day models is a key, and increasingly important strategic initiative of ours to meet the market demands of substantially reduced pricing to students, as well as the opportunity to improve student outcomes, while, at the same time, increasing our market share, revenue and relative gross profits of course material sales given the higher volumes of units sold in such models as compared to historical sales models that rely on individual student marketing and sales. These programs have allowed us to reverse historical long-term trends in course materials revenue declines, which have been observed at those schools where such programs have been adopted, and improve predictability of our future results. The growth of our BNC First Day programs offsets declines in a la carte courseware sales. We are moving quickly and decisively to accelerate our First Day Complete strategy. We have seen many institutions adopt First Day Complete in Fiscal 2024 and plan to continue to scale the number of schools adopting First Day Complete in Fiscal 2025 and beyond.</p>
<p>In the Spring of 2024, 160 campus stores are utilizing First Day Complete representing enrollment of nearly 805,000 undergraduate and post graduate students (as reported by National Center for Education Statistics), an increase of approximately 39% compared to Spring of 2023. During the 13 weeks ended January 27, 2024, First Day Complete sales increased by $42,629, or 64%, to $109,531 as compared to $66,902 in the prior year period. During the 13 weeks ended January 27, 2024, First Day sales increased by $20,742, or 39%, to $74,542 as compared to $53,800 in the prior year period. During the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024, First Day Complete sales increased by $98,084, or 57%, to $271,465 as compared to $173,381 in the prior year period. During the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024, First Day sales increased by $37,971, or 28%, to $173,629 as compared to $135,658 in the prior year period. ®</p>
<h2>Relationship with Fanatics and Lids</h2>
<p>In December 2020, we entered into the F/L Relationship. Under the related service provider agreements, we receive unparalleled product assortment, e-commerce capabilities and powerful digital marketing tools to drive increased value for customers and accelerate growth of our general merchandise business. Fanatics, operates as our service provider, including processing consumer personal information on our behalf, using their cutting-edge e-commerce and technology expertise to offer our campus store websites expanded product selection, a world-class online and mobile experience, and a progressive direct-to-consumer platform. Coupled with Lids, the leading standalone brick and mortar retailer focused exclusively on licensed fan and alumni products, our campus stores have improved access to trend and sales performance data on licensees, product styles, and design treatments.</p>
<p>We maintain our relationships with campus partners and remain responsible for staffing and managing the day-to-day operations of our campus bookstores. We also work closely with our campus partners to ensure that each campus store maintains unique aspects of in-store merchandising, including localized product assortments and specific styles and designs that reflect each campus's brand. As our service provider, we leverage Fanatics' e-commerce technology and expertise on our behalf for the operational management of the emblematic merchandise and gift sections of our campus store websites. Lids manages in-store assortment planning and merchandising of emblematic apparel, headwear, and gift products for our partner campus</p>

<h2>Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</h2>
<h2>Basis of Presentation and Consolidation</h2>
<p>Our condensed consolidated financial statements reflect our condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). Net income (loss) is equal to comprehensive income (loss) on our condensed consolidated statement of operations. In the opinion of the Company's management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly its consolidated financial position and the results of its operations and cash flows for the periods reported. These consolidated financial statements are condensed and therefore do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.</p>
<p>Our fiscal year is comprised of 52 or 53 weeks, ending on the Saturday closest to the last day of April. Due to the seasonal nature of the business, the results of operations for the 13 and 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024 are not indicative of the results expected for the 52 weeks ending April 27, 2024 ("Fiscal 2024").</p>
<h2>Liquidity and Going Concern</h2>
<p>The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern. This presentation contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business and does not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described below.</p>
<p>Pursuant to ASC 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern ("ASC 205-40") , management must evaluate whether there are conditions and events, considered in aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. In accordance with ASC 205-40, management's analysis can only include the potential mitigating impact of management's plans that have not been fully implemented as of the issuance date of these condensed consolidated financial statements if (a) it is probable that management's plans will be effectively implemented on a timely basis, and (b) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will alleviate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.</p>
<p>Our primary sources of cash are net cash flows from operating activities, funds available under our Credit Agreement, Term Loan Agreement, and short-term vendor financing. Our liquidity is highly dependent on the seasonal nature of our business, particularly with respect to course material sales, as sales are generally highest in the second and third fiscal quarters, when college students generally purchase textbooks for the upcoming Fall and Spring semesters, respectively. As of January 27, 2024, we had $15,024 of cash on hand, including $6,901 of restricted cash primarily related to segregated funds for commission due to Lids for logo merchandise sales as per the merchandising service provider agreement.</p>
<p>Our business was significantly negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during the years ended April 30, 2022 and May 1, 2021, as many schools adjusted their learning models and on-campus activities. Although most academic institutions have since reopened after the COVID-19 pandemic, the lingering impacts of the pandemic have resulted in changes in customer behaviors, lower enrollments, and an evolving educational landscape, including increased competition and disintermediation, which continued to impact our financial results during the year ended April 29, 2023. Some institutions are still providing alternatives to traditional in-person instruction, including online and hybrid learning options and significantly reduced classroom sizes. The impact of COVID-19 store closings, as well as lower earnings during the year ended April 29, 2023, resulted in the loss of cash flows and increased borrowings that we would not otherwise have expected to incur.</p>
<p>We recognized Net Loss from Continuing Operations of $(9,928) and $(22,134) for the 13 weeks endedJanu ary 27, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively, and a Net Loss from Continuing Operations of $(35,045) and $(48,288) for the 39 weeks endedJanu ary 27, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively, and we incurred a Net Loss from Continuing Operations of $(90,140), $(61,559), and $(133,569) for the years ended April 29, 2023, April 30, 2022, and May 1, 2021, respectively. Our Cash Flow (Used In) Provided by Operating Activities from Continuing Operations were $(83,221) and $(21,248) for the 39 weeks endedJanuar y 27, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively, and were $90,513, $(16,195), and $27,049, for the years ended April 29, 2023, April 30, 2022, and May 1, 2021, respectively.The tig htening of our available credit commitments,</p>

<p>including the elimination and repayment of our FILO Facility in fiscal year 2023 of $40,000, had a significant impact on our liquidity during fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2024, including our ability to make timely vendor payments and school commission payments.</p>
<p>Our losses and projected cash needs, combined with our current liquidity levels and the maturity of our Credit Facility, which becomes due on December 28, 2024, raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon the successful execution of management's plan to improve the Company's liquidity, including (1) raising additional liquidity and (2) continuing to take additional operational restructuring actions to achieve the required levels of liquidity to support the operations of the business.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the July 28, 2023 Credit Agreement amendment, the Board established a committee consisting of three independent directors to explore, consider, solicit expressions of interest or proposals for, respond to any communications, inquiries or proposals regarding, and advise as to all strategic alternatives to effect a "Specified Liquidity Transaction" (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The Board continues its ongoing review of a broad range of strategic alternatives available to the Company, including but not limited to potential capital raises, asset divestitures, a sale of the business, and pursuit of standalone growth plans. The Board has not set a timetable for the conclusion of this review, nor has it made any decisions related to any further actions at this time. There can be no assurance that the review will result in any transaction or other strategic change or outcome.</p>
<h2>Debt amendments</h2>
<p>On July 28, 2023, we amended our existing Credit Agreement to (i) extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement to December 28, 2024, (ii) reduce advance rates with respect to the borrowing base by 1000 basis points on September 2, 2024 (in lieu of the reductions previously contemplated for September 2023), (iii) subject to the conditions set forth in such amendment, add a CARES Act tax refund claim to the borrowing base, from April 1, 2024 through July 31, 2024, (iv) amend the financial maintenance covenant to require Availability (as defined in the Credit Agreement) at all times greater than the greater of (x) 10% of the Aggregate Loan Cap (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and (y) (A) $32,500 minus, subject to the conditions set forth in such amendment, (B) (a) $7,500 for the period of April 1, 2024 through and including April 30, 2024, (b) $2,500 for the period of May 1, 2024 through and including May 31, 2024 and (c) $0 at all other times, (v) add a minimum Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) financial maintenance covenant, and (vi) amend certain negative and affirmative covenants and add certain additional covenants, all as more particularly set forth in such amendment. The amendment also requires that we appoint a Chief Restructuring Officer and that, by August 11, 2023, we (i) appoint two independent members to the board of directors of the Company from prospective candidates that have been previously disclosed to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and (ii) appoint a committee of the board of directors of the Company to consist of three board members (two of whom will be the new independent directors), and as of the date of this filing, we have satisfied such requirements. The committee's responsibilities will include, among other things, to explore, consider, solicit expressions of interest or proposals for, respond to any communications, inquiries or proposals regarding, and advise as to all strategic alternatives to effect a "Specified Liquidity Transaction" (as defined in the Credit Agreement). There can be no guarantee or assurances that any such transaction or transactions be consummated. We must pay (i) a fee of 0.50% of the outstanding principal amount of the commitments under the Credit Agreement March 2023 amendment (as defined in the Credit Agreement) on the closing date (in lieu of the deferred fee previously contemplated in connection with the March 2023 amendment (as defined in the Credit Agreement)) and (ii) a fee of 1.00% of the outstanding principal amount of the commitments under the Credit Agreement as of the closing date on the earlier to occur of September 2, 2024 and an Event of Default (as defined in the Credit Agreement).</p>
<p>On July 28, 2023, we amended our Term Loan Agreement to (i) extend the maturity date of the Term Loan Agreement to April 7, 2025, (ii) allow for interest to be paid in kind until September 2, 2024, (iii) amend the 1.50% anniversary fee to recur on June 7 of each year that the Term Loan Agreement remains outstanding, with 2024 fee deferred to the earlier of September 2, 2024 and the Termination Date (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) and (iv) amend certain negative covenants and affirmative and add certain additional covenants. We must pay a fee of $50,000 to the lenders under the Term Loan Agreement on the earlier of September 2, 2024 and the Termination Date (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement).</p>
<p>On October 10, 2023, we amended our existing Credit Agreement to revise certain reporting requirements to the administrative agent and lenders under the Credit Agreement. The amendment introduced a Specified Liquidity Transaction Fee of $3,800 that would become due and payable at the earlier to occur of (1) January 31, 2024, to the extent a Specified Liquidity Transaction (as defined in the Credit Agreement) has not been consummated prior to such date (or such later date that is up to thirty days thereafter to the extent agreed to in writing by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion) or (b) an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement.</p>

<p>On December 12, 2023, we amended our existing Credit Agreement to, among other things: (i) amend the financial maintenance covenant to require Availability (as defined in the Credit Agreement) at all times to be greater than the greater of (x) 10% of the Aggregate Loan Cap (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and (y) (A) $32,500 or, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions relating to the repayment of the Credit Agreement in full, (B) (a) $20,000 for the period of December 8, 2023 through January 12, 2024, (b) $25,000 for the period from January 26, 2024 through February 9, 2024, (c) $25,000 for the period of April 1, 2024 through April 30, 2024 and (d) $30,000 for the period of May 1, 2024 through May 31, 2024, and (ii) revise certain reporting requirements under the Credit Agreement. The amendment also revised the Specified Liquidity Transaction Fee introduced in the October 2023 Credit Agreement Amendment such that the $3,800 became due and was paid on January 31, 2024.</p>
<p>On March 12, 2024, we amended our existing Credit Agreement to, among other things, (i) revise certain reporting requirements under the Credit Agreement and (ii) set certain milestones for liquidity and refinancing contingency plans, with respect to which we must execute a binding commitment no later than April 3, 2024 (as may be extended by the administrative agent to April 10, 2024).</p>
<h2>Operational restructuring plans</h2>
<p>During Fiscal 2023, we implemented a significant cost reduction program designed to streamline our operations, maximize productivity and drive profitability. We reduced our workforce, eliminated duplicate administrative headcounts at all levels, implemented improved system development processes to reduce maintenance costs, reduced capital expenditures, and evaluated operating contractual obligations for cost savings. Over the course of Fiscal 2024, we have achieved annualized savings of approximately $30,000 to $35,000 from the Fiscal 2023 cost savings initiatives. Additionally, during Fiscal 2024, Management's plan to implement further cost savings measures, including reduction of gross capital expenditures, amounting to approximately $25,000, of which approximately $18,000 has been achieved during the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024. Management believes that these plans are within its control and will be focused on implementing these cost savings measures.</p>
<p>During the 13 weeks ended January 27, 2024, Net Loss from Continuing Operations improved by $12,206, or 55%, compared to the prior year period. Net Loss from Continuing Operations, excluding interest expense, impairment loss (non-cash) and restructuring and other charges, improved by $14,984 during the 13 weeks ended January 27, 2024 compared to the prior year period. During the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024, Net Loss from Continuing Operations improved by $13,243, or 27%, compared to the prior year period. Net Loss from Continuing Operations, excluding interest expense, impairment loss (non-cash) and restructuring and other charges, improved by $34,457 during the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024 compared to the prior year period. The improvements in Net Loss from Continuing Operations during the 13 and 39 weeks are primarily due to operational improvements, including successful implementation of our BNC First Day programs, and cost savings initiatives.</p>

<h2>Seasonality</h2>
<p>Our business is highly seasonal. For example, our retail business is seasonal, particularly with respect to textbook sales and rentals, with the major portion of sales and operating profit realized during the second and third fiscal quarters when college students generally purchase and rent textbooks for the upcoming semesters and lowest in the first and fourth fiscal quarters. Our quarterly results also may fluctuate depending on the timing of the start of the various schools' semesters, the revenue impact of accounting principles with respect to the recognition of revenue associated with our equitable and inclusive access programs, the ability to secure inventory on a timely basis, as well as shifts in our fiscal calendar dates. These shifts in timing may affect the comparability of our results across periods. Sales attributable to our wholesale business are generally highest in our first, second and third quarters, as it sells textbooks and other course materials for retail distribution. See Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue discussion below.</p>
<h2>Use of Estimates</h2>
<p>In preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.</p>
<h2>Discontinued Operations</h2>
<p>During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, assets related to our Digital Student Solutions ("DSS") Segment met the criteria for classification as Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations and is no longer a reportable segment. Certain assets and liabilities associated with the DSS Segment are presented in our condensed consolidated balance sheets as "Assets Held for Sale" and "Liabilities Held for Sale". The results of operations related to the DSS Segment are included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as "Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax." The cash flows of the DSS Segment are also presented separately in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. All corresponding prior year periods presented in our financial statements and related information in the accompanying notes have been reclassified to reflect the Asset Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations presentation.</p>
<p>On May 31, 2023, we completed the sale of these assets related to our DSS Segment for cash proceeds of $ 20,000, net of certain transaction fees, severance costs, escrow, and other considerations. During the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024, we recorded a Gain on Sale of Business of $3,545 in Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net, related to the sale. Net cash proceeds from the sale were used for debt repayment and provided additional funds for working capital needs under our Credit Facility. The following table summarizes the operating results of the discontinued operations for the periods indicated:</p>

<p>As of January 27, 2024, January 28, 2023, and April 29, 2023, we had restricted cash of $6,901, $18,309, and $16,712, respectively, comprised of $5,948, $17,397, and $15,790, respectively, in prepaid and other current assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet related to segregated funds for commission due to Lids for logo merchandise sales as per the Lids service provider merchandising agreement, and $953, $912, and $922, respectively, in other noncurrent assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet related to amounts held in trust for future distributions related to employee benefit plans.</p>
<h2>Merchandise Inventories</h2>
<p>Merchandise inventories, which consist of finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost or market. Market value of our inventory, which is all purchased finished goods, is determined based on its estimated net realizable value, which is generally the selling price less normally predictable costs of disposal and transportation. Reserves for non-returnable inventory are based on our history of liquidating non-returnable inventory, which includes certain significant assumptions, including markdowns, sales below cost, inventory aging and expected demand.</p>
<p>Cost is determined primarily by the retail inventory method for our Retail segment. Our textbook and trade book inventories, for Retail and Wholesale, are valued using the LIFO method and the related reserve was not material to the recorded amount of our inventories. There were no LIFO adjustments in Fiscal 2023, Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021.</p>
<p>For our physical bookstores, we also estimate and accrue shortage for the period between the last physical count of inventory and the balance sheet date. Shortage rates are estimated and accrued based on historical rates and can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage trends.</p>
<p>The Retail Segment fulfillment order is directed first to our wholesale business before other sources of inventory are utilized. The products that we sell originate from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. After internal sourcing, the bookstore purchases textbooks from outside suppliers and publishers.</p>

<h2>Textbook Rental Inventories</h2>
<p>Physical textbooks out on rent are categorized as textbook rental inventories. At the time a rental transaction is consummated, the book is removed from merchandise inventories and moved to textbook rental inventories at cost. The cost of the book is amortized down to its estimated residual value over the rental period. The related amortization expense is included in cost of goods sold. At the end of the rental period, upon return, the book is removed from textbook rental inventories and recorded in merchandise inventories at its amortized cost.</p>
<h2>Leases</h2>
<p>We recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet for all operating lease arrangements based on the present value of future lease payments as required by Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 842, Leases . We do not recognize lease assets or lease liabilities for short-term leases (i.e., those with a term of twelve months or less). We recognize lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term for contracts with fixed lease payments, including those with fixed annual minimums, or over a rolling twelve-month period for leases where the annual guarantee resets at the start of each contract year, in order to best reflect the pattern of usage of the underlying leased asset. We recognize lease expense related to our college and university contracts as cost of sales in our condensed consolidated statement of operations and we recognize lease expense related to our various office spaces as selling and administrative expenses in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. For additional information, see Note 8. Leases .</p>
<h2>Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue</h2>
<p>Product sales and rentals</p>
<p>The majority of our revenue is derived from the sale of products through our bookstore locations, including virtual bookstores, and our bookstore affiliated ecommerce websites, and contains a single performance obligation. Revenue from sales of our products is recognized at the point in time when control of the products is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the products. For additional information, see Note 3. Revenue.</p>
<p>Retail product revenue is recognized when the customer takes physical possession of our products, which occurs either at the point of sale for products purchased at physical locations or upon receipt of our products by our customers for products ordered through our websites and virtual bookstores. Wholesale product revenue is recognized upon shipment of physical textbooks at which point title passes and risk of loss is transferred to the customer. Additional revenue is recognized for shipping charges billed to customers and shipping costs are accounted for as fulfillment costs within cost of goods sold.</p>
<p>Revenue from the sale of digital textbooks, which contains a single performance obligation, is recognized at the point of sale as product revenue in our condensed consolidated financial statements. A software feature is embedded within the content of our digital textbooks, such that upon expiration of the term the customer is no longer able to access the content. While the sale of the digital textbook allows the customer to access digital content for a fixed period of time, once the digital content is delivered to the customer, our performance obligation is complete.</p>
<p>Revenue from the rental of physical textbooks is deferred and recognized over the rental period based on the passage of time commencing at the point of sale, when control of the product transfers to the customer and is recognized as rental income in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Rental periods are typically for a single semester and are always less than one year in duration. We offer a buyout option to allow the purchase of a rented physical textbook at the end of the rental period if the customer desires to do so. We record the buyout purchase when the customer exercises and pays the buyout option price which is determined at the time of the buyout. In these instances, we accelerate any remaining deferred rental revenue at the point of sale.</p>
<p>Revenue recognized for our BNC First Day offerings is consistent with our policies outlined above for product, digital and rental sales, net of an anticipated opt-out or return provision. Given the growth of BNC First Day programs, the timing of cash collection from our school partners may shift to periods subsequent to when the revenue is recognized. When a school adopts our BNC First Day equitable and inclusive access offerings, cash collection from the school generally occurs after the institution's drop/add dates, which is later in the working capital cycle, particularly in our third quarter given the timing of the Spring Term and our quarterly reporting period, as compared to direct-to-student point-of-sale transactions where cash is generally collected during the point-of-sale transaction or within a few days from the credit card processor.</p>
<p>We estimate returns based on an analysis of historical experience. A provision for anticipated merchandise returns is</p>

<p>provided through a reduction of sales and cost of goods sold in the period that the related sales are recorded.</p>
<p>For sales and rentals involving third-party products, we evaluate whether we are acting as a principal or an agent. Our determination is based on our evaluation of whether we control the specified goods or services prior to transferring them to the customer. There are significant judgments involved in determining whether we control the specified goods or services prior to transferring them to the customer including whether we have the ability to direct the use of the good or service and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the good or service. For those transactions where we are the principal, we record revenue on a gross basis, and for those transactions where we are an agent to a third-party, we record revenue on a net basis.</p>
<p>As contemplated by the F/L Relationship related merchandising agreement and e-commerce agreement, logo general merchandise sales are fulfilled by Lids and Fanatics on our behalf and we recognize commission revenue earned for these sales on a net basis in our condensed consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p>We do not have gift card or customer loyalty programs. We do not treat any promotional offers as expenses. Sales tax collected from our customers is excluded from reported revenues. Our payment terms are generally 30 days and do not extend beyond one year.</p>
<h2>Service and other revenue</h2>
<p>Service and other revenue is primarily derived from brand partnership marketing services which includes promotional activities and advertisements within our physical bookstores and web properties performed on behalf of third-party customers, shipping and handling, and revenue from other programs.</p>
<p>Brand partnership marketing agreements often include multiple performance obligations which are individually negotiated with our customers. For these arrangements that contain distinct performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price based on the relative standalone selling price method by comparing the standalone selling price ("SSP") of each distinct performance obligation to the total value of the contract. The revenue is recognized as each performance obligation is satisfied, typically at a point in time for brand partnership marketing service and overtime for advertising efforts as measured based upon the passage of time for contracts that are based on a stated period of time or the number of impressions delivered for contracts with a fixed number of impressions.</p>
<h2>Cost of Sales</h2>
<p>Our cost of sales primarily includes costs such as merchandise costs, textbook rental amortization, content development cost amortization, warehouse costs related to inventory management and order fulfillment, insurance, certain payroll costs, and management service agreement costs, including rent expense, related to our college and university contracts and other facility related expenses.</p>
<h2>Selling and Administrative Expenses</h2>
<p>Our selling and administrative expenses consist primarily of store payroll and store operating expenses. Selling and administrative expenses also include long-term incentive plan compensation expense and general office expenses, such as merchandising, procurement, field support, finance and accounting. Shared-service costs such as human resources, legal, treasury, information technology, and various other corporate level expenses and other governance functions, are not allocated to a specific reporting segment and are recorded in Corporate Services.</p>
<h2>Evaluation of Long-Lived Assets</h2>
<p>During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, assets related to our DSS Segment met the criteria for classification as Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations and is no longer a reportable segment. Goodwill on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of Janu ary 28, 2023 related to our DSS reporting unit has been classified as Assets Held for Sale. On May 31, 2023, we completed the sale of these assets related to our DSS Segment.</p>
<p>We review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, including but not limited to contractual changes, renewals or amendments are made to agreements with our college, university, or K-12 schools, indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 360-10, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets . As of January 27, 2024, our other long-lived assets include property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, amortizable intangibles, and other noncurrent assets of $57,273, $220,238, $97,947, and $12,488, respectively, on our condensed consolidated balance sheet.</p>

<p>Although most academic institutions have since reopened since the COVID-19 pandemic, some are providing alternatives to traditional in-person instruction, including online and hybrid learning options and significantly reduced classroom sizes. Enrollment trends have been negatively impacted at physical campuses. While many athletic conferences resumed their sport activities, other events, such as parent and alumni weekends and prospective student campus tour activities, some may still be curtailed or offer a virtual option. These combined events, a s well as increased competition and disintermediation,c ontinue to impact the Company's course materials and general merchandise business.</p>
<p>During the 13 weeks ended January 27, 2024, we evaluated certain of our store-level long-lived assets in the Retail segment for impairment. Based on the results of the impairment tests, we recognized an impairment loss (non-cash) of $5,798 (both pre-tax and after-tax), comprised of $364, $2,726, and $2,708 of property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, and amortizable intangibles, respectively, on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.</p>
<p>During the 13 weeks ended J anuary 28, 2023, we evaluated certain of our store-level long-lived assets in the Retail segment for impairment. Based on the results of the impairment tests, we recognized an impairment loss (non-cash) of $6,008 (both pre-tax and after-tax), comprised of $708, $1,697, $3,599 and $4 of property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, amortizable intangibles, and other noncurrent assets, respectively, on the condensed consolidated statements of operations.</p>
<p>The fair value of the impaired long-lived assets were determined using an income approach (Level 3 input), using the Company's best estimates of the amount and timing of future discounted cash flows, based on historical experience, market conditions, current trends and performance expectations. For additional information, see Note 6. Fair Value Measurements .</p>
<h2>Income Taxes</h2>
<p>The provision for income taxes includes federal, state and local income taxes currently payable and those deferred because of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities. The deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse. We regularly review deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance, if determined to be necessary.</p>
<h2>Recent Accounting Pronouncements</h2>
<p>In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures to improve annual income tax disclosure requirements, primarily to (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold, and (3) enhance cash tax payment disclosures. This guidance will be effective for the Company for the annual report for the fiscal year ending April 26, 2025. Early adoption is permitted and the guidance is applied on a prospective basis. We are currently assessing this guidance and determining the impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p>In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. This guidance will be effective for the Company for the annual report for the fiscal year ending April 26, 2025 and subsequent interim periods. Early adoption is permitted and retrospective adoption is required for all prior periods presented. We are currently assessing this guidance and determining the impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.</p>
<h2>Note 3. Revenue</h2>
<p>Revenue from sales of our products and services is recognized either at the point in time when control of the products is transferred to our customers or over time as services are provided in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the products or services.

<h2>Note 4. Segment Reporting</h2>
<p>During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, assets related to our DSS Segment met the criteria for classification as Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations and is no longer a reportable segment. On May 31, 2023, we completed the sale of these assets related to our DSS Segment. For additional information, see Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.</p>
<p>We have two reportable segments: Retail and Wholesale. Additionally, unallocated shared-service costs, which include various corporate level expenses and other governance functions, are not allocated to a specific reporting segment and continue to be presented as "Corporate Services".</p>
<p>We identify our segments in accordance with the way our business is managed (focusing on the financial information distributed) and the manner in which our chief operating decision maker allocates resources and assesses financial performance. The following summarizes the two segments. For additional information about each segment's operations, see Part I - Item 1. Business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2023 .</p>
<h2>Retail Segment</h2>
<p>The Retail Segment operates 1,272 college, university, and K-12 school bookstores, comprised of 717 physical bookstores and 555 virtual bookstores. Our bookstores typically operate under agreements with the college, university, or K-12 schools to be the official bookstore and the exclusive seller of course materials and supplies, including physical and digital products. The majority of the physical campus bookstores have school-branded e-commerce websites which we operate independently or along with our merchant service providers, and which offer students access to affordable course materials and affinity products, including emblematic apparel and gifts. The Retail Segment offers our BNC First Day equitable and inclusive access programs, consisting of First Day Complete and First Day , which provide faculty required course materials on or before the first day of class at below market rates, as compared to the total retail price for the same course materials if purchased separately (a la carte) and students are billed the below market rate, directly by the institution as a course charge or included in tuition. Additionally, the Retail Segment offers a suite of digital content and services to colleges and universities, including a variety of open educational resource-based courseware. ®</p>
<h2>Wholesale Segment</h2>
<p>The Wholesale Segment is comprised of our wholesale textbook business and is one of the largest textbook wholesalers in the country. The Wholesale Segment centrally sources, sells, and distributes new and used textbooks to approximately 2,900 physical bookstores (including our Retail Segment's717 physical bookstores) and sources and distributes new and used textbooks to our 555 virtual bookstores. Additionally, the Wholesale Segment sells hardware and a software suite of applications that provides inventory management and point-of-sale solutions to approximately 325 college bookstores.</p>
<p>Corporate Services represents unallocated shared-service costs which include corporate level expenses and other governance functions, including executive functions, such as accounting, legal, treasury, information technology, and human resources.</p>
<h2>Intercompany Eliminations</h2>
<p>The eliminations are primarily related to the following intercompany activities:</p>
<ul>
<li>· The sales eliminations represent the elimination of Wholesale sales and fulfillment service fees to Retail and the elimination of Retail commissions earned from Wholesale, and</li>
<li>· These cost of sales eliminations represent (i) the recognition of intercompany profit for Retail inventory that was purchased from Wholesale in a prior period that was subsequently sold to external customers during the current period and the elimination of Wholesale service fees charged for fulfillment of inventory for virtual store sales, net of (ii) the elimination of intercompany profit for Wholesale inventory purchases by Retail that remain in ending inventory at the end of the current period.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our international operations are not material, and the majority of the revenue and total assets are within the United States.</p>

<h2>Note 5. Equity and Earnings Per Share</h2>
<h2>Equity</h2>
<h2>Share Repurchases</h2>
<p>During the 13 and 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024, we did not repurchase shares of our Common Stock under the stock repurchase program and as of January 27, 2024, approximately $26,669 remains available under the stock repurchase program.</p>
<p>During the 13 and 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024, we repurchased3,135 and 147,885 shares of our Common Stock, respectively, outside of the stock repurchase program in connection with employee tax withholding obligations for vested stock awards.</p>
<h2>Earnings Per Share</h2>
<p>Basic EPS is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year. Diluted EPS is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the year plus the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents using the treasury stock method and the average market price of our common stock for the year. We include participating securities (unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents) in the computation of EPS pursuant to the two-class method. Our participating securities consist solely of unvested restricted stock awards, which have contractual participation rights equivalent to those of stockholders of unrestricted common stock. The two-class method of computing earnings per share is an allocation method that calculates earnings per share for common stock and participating securities. During periods of net loss, no effect is given to the participating securities because they do not share in the losses of the Company. During the 13 weeks ended January 27, 2024 and January 28, 2023, average shares of3,009,464 and 4,677,926 were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation as their inclusion would have been antidilutive, respectively. During the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024 and January 28, 2023, average shares of 3,305,749 and 4,824,844 were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation as their inclusion would have been antidilutive, respectively.

<h2>Note 6. Fair Value Measurements</h2>
<p>In accordance with ASC No. 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , the fair value of an asset is considered to be the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated knowledgeable and willing parties. A liability's fair value is defined as the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new obligor, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor.</p>

<p>(Thousands of dollars, except share and per share data)</p>
<p>(unaudited)</p>
<p>Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. These tiers include:</p>
<p>Level 1-Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices in active markets</p>
<p>Level 2-Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable</p>
<p>Level 3-Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring us to develop our own assumptions</p>
<p>Our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accrued liabilities and accounts payable. The fair value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accrued liabilities and accounts payable approximates their carrying values because of the short-term nature of these instruments, which are all considered Level 1. The fair value of short-term and long-term debt approximates its carrying value.</p>
<h2>Non-Financial Assets and Liabilities</h2>
<p>Our non-financial assets include property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, and intangible assets. Such assets are reported at their carrying values and are not subject to recurring fair value measurements. We review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 360-10, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets .</p>
<p>During the 13 weeks ended January 27, 2024 and January 28, 2023, we evaluated certain of our store-level long-lived assets in the Retail segment for impairment and based on the results of the impairment tests, we recognized an impairment loss (non-cash) of $5,798 and $6,008 (both pre-tax and after-tax), respectively, on the condensed consolidated statement of operations. The fair value of the impaired long-lived assets were determined using an income approach (Level 3 input), using our best estimates of the amount and timing of future discounted cash flows, based on historical experience, market conditions, current trends and performance expectations. For additional information, see Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies .</p>
<p>The following table shows the fair values of our non-financial assets and liabilities that were required to be remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis for each respective period and the total impairments recorded as a result of the remeasurement process:</p>

<h2>Other Non-Financial Liabilities</h2>
<p>We granted phantom share units as long-term incentive awards which are settled in cash based on the fair market value of a share of common stock of the Company at each vesting date. The fair value of the liability for the cash-settled phantom share unit awards will be remeasured at the end of each reporting period through settlement to reflect current risk-free rate and volatility assumptions. As of January 27, 2024, we recorded a liability of $34 (Level 2 input) which is reflected in accrued liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. As of January 28, 2023, we recorded a liability of $1,261 (Level 2 input) which is reflected in accrued liabilities ($1,205) and other long-term liabilities ($56) on the condensed consolidated balance sheet.

The agreement included an incremental first in, last out seasonal loan facility (the "FILO Facility") for a $100,000 maintaining the maximum availability under the Credit Agreement at $500,000.

The proceeds of the Term Loans are being used to finance working capital, and to pay fees and expenses related to the Term Loan Facility. During the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024, we incurred $1,750 for interest in kind on the Term Loans and repaid $0 under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, with $31,750 of outstanding borrowings as of January 27, 2024.

<p>During the 52 weeks ended April 29, 2023, we incurred debt issuance costs totaling $431 related to the March 2023 Term Loan Credit Agreement amendment. We paid a fee of $50 on the amendment closing date to the lenders under the Term Loan Credit Agreement. The debt issuance costs have been deferred and are presented as a reduction to long-term borrowings in the consolidated balance sheets, and subsequently amortized ratably over the term of the Term Loan Facility.</p>
<h2>July 2023 Term Loan Credit Agreement Amendment</h2>
<p>On July 28, 2023, we amended our Term Loan to (i) extend the maturity date of the Term Loan Agreement to April 7, 2025, (ii) allow for interest to be paid in kind until September 2, 2024, (iii) amend the 1.50% anniversary fee to recur on June 7 of each year that the Term Loan Agreement remains outstanding, with 2024 fee deferred to the earlier of September 2, 2024 and the Termination Date (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) and (iv) amend certain negative covenants and affirmative and add certain additional covenants.

<p>During the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024, we incurred debt issuance costs totaling $480 related to the July 2023 Term Loan Credit Agreement amendment. The debt issuance costs have been deferred and are presented as a reduction to long-term borrowings in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, and subsequently amortized ratably over the term of the Term Loan Facility.</p>
<p>The Term Loans accrue interest at a rate equal to 11.25%, payable quarterly. All interest on the Term Loan prior to July 29, 2023 was paid in cash. During the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023 and 13 weeks ended January 27, 2024, all interest on the Term Loan was incurred in kind as permitted under the July 2023 Term Loan Amendment. The Term Loans do not amortize prior to maturity.</p>
<p>The Term Loan Credit Agreement does not contain a financial covenant, but otherwise contains representations and warranties, covenants and events of default that are substantially the same as those in the Credit Agreement, including restrictions on the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur additional debt, incur or permit liens on assets, make investments and acquisitions, consolidate or merge with any other company, engage in asset sales and make dividends and distributions. The Term Loan Facility is secured by second-priority liens on all assets securing the obligations under the Credit Agreement, which is all of the assets of the Company and the Guarantors, subject to customary exclusions and limitations set forth in the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the other loan documents executed in connection therewith.</p>
<p>The Credit Agreement amendment permitted us to incur the Term Loan Facility and also provides that, upon repayment of the Term Loan Credit Agreement (and, if applicable, any replacement credit facility thereof), we may incur second lien secured debt in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $75,000.</p>

<p>We recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets for substantially all lease arrangements as required by FASB ASC 842, Leases (Topic 842). Our portfolio of leases consists of operating leases comprised of operations agreements which grant us the right to operate on-campus bookstores at colleges and universities; real estate leases for office and warehouse operations; and vehicle leases. We do not have finance leases or short-term leases (i.e., those with a term of twelve months or less).</p>
<p>We recognize a right of use ("ROU") asset and lease liability in our condensed consolidated balance sheets for leases with a term greater than twelve months. Options to extend or terminate a lease are included in the determination of the ROU asset and lease liability when it is reasonably certain that such options will be exercised. Our lease terms generally range from one year to fifteen years and a number of agreements contain minimum annual guarantees, many of which are adjusted at the start of each contract year based on the actual sales activity of the leased premises for the most recently completed contract year.</p>
<p>Payment terms are based on the fixed rates explicit in the lease, including minimum annual guarantees, and/or variable rates based on: i) a percentage of revenues or sales arising at the relevant premises ("variable commissions"), and/or ii) operating expenses, such as common area charges, real estate taxes and insurance. For contracts with fixed lease payments, including those with minimum annual guarantees, we recognize lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term or over the contract year in order to best reflect the pattern of usage of the underlying leased asset and our minimum obligations arising from these types of leases. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees, material restrictions or covenants.</p>
<p>We used our incremental borrowing rates to determine the present value of fixed lease payments based on the information available at the lease commencement date, as the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. We utilized an estimated collateralized incremental borrowing rate as of the effective date or the commencement date of the lease, whichever is later.</p>
<p>During the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024 and January 28, 2023, we recognized lease expense of $139 and $121, respectively, related to our various office spaces as selling and administrative expenses in our condensed consolidated statement of operations.</p>

| Net lease expense | $ 52,509 | $ 55,795 | $ 159,353 | $ 172,040 |</p>
<p>The decrease in lease expense during the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024 is primarily due to lower commission rates related to the shift from physical to digital course materials, closed stores, and the impact of the timing due to contract renewals, partially offset by higher sales for contracts based on a percentage of sales.</p>

<h2>Note 9. Supplementary Information</h2>
<h2>Restructuring and other charges</h2>
<p>During the 13 and 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024, we recognized restructuring and other charges totaling $3,413 and $12,320, respectively, comprised primarily of $3,413 and $11,240, respectively, for costs primarily associated with professional service costs for restructuring as discussed below and process improvements, and $0 and $1,080, respectively, for severance and other employee termination and benefit costs associated with elimination of various positions as part of cost reduction objectives ($921 is included in accrued liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of January 27, 2024).</p>
<p>Pursuant to the July 28, 2023 Credit Agreement amendment, the Board established a committee consisting of three independent directors to explore, consider, solicit expressions of interest or proposals for, respond to any communications, inquiries or proposals regarding, and advise as to all strategic alternatives to effect a "Specified Liquidity Transaction" (as</p>

<p>During the 13 and 39 weeks ended January 28, 2023, we recognized restructuring and other charges totaling $4,127 and $4,762, respectively, comprised primarily of $2,848 in each period for severance and other employee termination and benefit costs associated with elimination of various positions as part of cost reduction objectives, and $1,279 and $1,914, respectively, for costs primarily associated with professional service costs for restructuring and process improvements.</p>
<h2>Note 10. Long-Term Incentive Plan Compensation Expense</h2>
<p>During the 13 and 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024, we did not grant any long-term incentive plan awards.We recognized compensation expense for previously granted long-term incentive plan awards in selling and administrative expenses as follows:</p>

<p>Total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested awards as of January 27, 2024 was $3,173 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.3 years.</p>
<h2>Note 11. Employee Benefit Plans</h2>
<p>We sponsor defined contribution plans for the benefit of substantially all of the employees of BNC. MBS maintains a profit sharing plan covering substantially all full-time employees of MBS. For all plans, we are responsible to fund the employer contributions directly. Total employee benefit expense for these plans was $ 0 and $1,101 during the 13 weeks ended January 27, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively. Total employee benefit expense for these plans was $1,687 and $3,386 during the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively.</p>
<p>Commencing in September 2023, we revised the 401(k)-retirement savings plan to an annual end of plan year discretionary match, in lieu of the current pay period match.</p>
<h2>Note 12. Income Taxes</h2>
<p>We recorded an income tax expense of $229 on pre-tax loss of $(9,699) during the 13 weeks ended January 27, 2024, which represented an effective income tax rate of (2.4)% and an income tax expense of $139 on pre-tax loss of $(21,995) during the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2023, which represented an effective income tax rate of (0.6)%. We recorded an income tax expense of $532 on pre-tax loss of $(34,513) during the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024, which represented an effective income tax rate of (1.5)% and an income tax expense of $603 on pre-tax loss of $(47,685) during the 39 weeks ended January 28, 2023, which represented an effective income tax rate of (1.3)%. The effective tax rate for the 13 weeks ended January 27, 2024 is lower than the prior year comparable period due to immaterial return to provision adjustments recorded in the prior year. The effective tax rate for the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024 is materially consistent with the prior year comparable period.</p>
<p>In assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets, management considered whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets would be realized. As of January 27, 2024, we determined that it was more likely than not that</p>

References to "Barnes &amp; Noble College" or "BNC" refer to our subsidiary Barnes &amp; Noble College Booksellers, LLC. References to "MBS" refer to our subsidiary MBS Textbook Exchange, LLC.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<h2>Description of Business</h2>
<p>Barnes &amp; Noble Education, Inc. ("BNED") is one of the largest contract operators of physical and virtual bookstores for college and university campuses and K-12 institutions across the United States. We are also one of the largest textbook wholesalers, inventory management hardware and software providers. We operate 1,272 physical, virtual, and custom bookstores and serve more than 5.8 million students, delivering essential educational content, tools and general merchandise within a dynamic omnichannel retail environment.</p>
<p>The strengths of our business include our ability to compete by developing new products and solutions to meet market needs, our large operating footprint with direct access to students and faculty, our well-established, deep relationships with academic partners and stable, long-term contracts and our well-recognized brands. We provide product and service offerings designed to address the most pressing issues in higher education, including equitable access, enhanced convenience and improved affordability through innovative course material delivery models designed to drive improved student experiences and outcomes. We offer our BNC First Day equitable and inclusive access programs, consisting of First Day Complete and First Day , which provide faculty required course materials on or before the first day of class at below market rates, as compared to the total retail price for the same course materials if purchased separately (a la carte) and students are billed the below market rate directly by the institution as a course charge or included in tuition. During the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024, BNC First Day total revenue increased by $136 million, or 44%, to $445 million compared to $309 million during the prior year period. These programs have allowed us to reverse historical long-term trends in course materials revenue declines as the growth of our BNC First Day programs offsets declines in a la carte courseware sales and closed store sales. ®</p>
<p>We expect to continue to introduce scalable and advanced solutions focused largely on the student and customer experience, expand our e-commerce capabilities and accelerate such capabilities through our service providers, Fanatics Retail Group Fulfillment, LLC, Inc. ("Fanatics") and Fanatics Lids College, Inc. D/B/A "Lids" ("Lids") (collectively referred to herein as the "F/L Relationship"), win new accounts, and expand our revenue opportunities through strategic relationships. We expect gross comparable store general merchandise sales to increase over the long term, as our product assortments continue to emphasize and reflect changing consumer trends, and we evolve our presentation concepts and merchandising of products in stores and online, which we expect to be further enhanced and accelerated through the F/L Relationship. As our service providers, we receive unparalleled product assortment, e-commerce capabilities and powerful digital marketing tools from Fanatics and Lids on our behalf to drive increased value for customers and accelerate growth of our logo general merchandise business.</p>
<p>The Barnes &amp; Noble brand (licensed from our former parent) along with our subsidiary brands, BNC and MBS, are synonymous with innovation in bookselling and campus retailing, and are widely recognized and respected brands in the United States. Our large college footprint, reputation, and credibility in the marketplace not only support our marketing efforts to universities, students, and faculty, but are also important to our relationship with leading publishers who rely on us as one of their primary distribution channels.</p>
<p>For additional information related to our business, see Part I - Item 1. Business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2023.</p>
<h2>BNC First Day Equitable and Inclusive Access Programs</h2>
<p>We provide product and service offerings designed to address the most pressing issues in higher education, including equitable access, enhanced convenience and improved affordability through innovative course material delivery models designed to drive improved student experiences and outcomes. We offer our BNC First Day equitable and inclusive access programs, consisting of First Day Complete and First Day , which provide faculty required course materials on or before the first day of class at below market rates, as compared to the total retail price for the same course materials if purchased separately (a la carte) and students are billed the below market rate directly by the institution as a course charge or included in tuition. ®</p>
<ul>
<li>· First Day Complete is adopted by an institution and includes the majority of undergraduate classes (and on occasion graduate classes), providing students both physical and digital materials. The First Day Complete model drives substantially greater unit sales and sell-through for the bookstore.</li>
<li>· First Day is adopted by a faculty member for a single course, and students receive primarily digital course materials through their school's learning management system ("LMS").</li>
</ul>
<p>Offering course materials through our equitable and inclusive access First Day Complete and First Day models is a key, and increasingly important strategic initiative of ours to meet the market demands of substantially reduced pricing to students, as well as the opportunity to improve student outcomes, while, at the same time, increasing our market share, revenue and relative gross profits of course material sales given the higher volumes of units sold in such models as compared to historical sales models that rely on individual student marketing and sales. These programs have allowed us to reverse historical long-term trends in course materials revenue declines, which have been observed at those schools where such programs have been adopted, and improve predictability of our future results. The growth of our BNC First Day programs offsets declines in a la carte courseware sales and closed store sales. We are moving quickly and decisively to accelerate our First Day Complete strategy. We have seen many institutions adopt First Day Complete in Fiscal 2024 and plan to continue to scale the number of schools adopting First Day Complete in Fiscal 2025 and beyond.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes our BNC First Day sales for the 13 and 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024 and January 28, 2023:</p>

<h2>Relationship with Fanatics and Lids</h2>
<p>In December 2020, we entered into the F/L Relationship. Under the related service provider agreements, we receive unparalleled product assortment, e-commerce capabilities and powerful digital marketing tools to drive increased value for customers and accelerate growth of our general merchandise business. Fanatics, operates as our service provider, including processing consumer personal information on our behalf, using their cutting-edge e-commerce and technology expertise to offer our campus store websites expanded product selection, a world-class online and mobile experience, and a progressive direct-to-consumer platform. Coupled with Lids, the leading standalone brick and mortar retailer focused exclusively on licensed fan and alumni products, our campus stores have improved access to trend and sales performance data on licensees, product styles, and design treatments.</p>
<p>We maintain our relationships with campus partners and remain responsible for staffing and managing the day-to-day operations of our campus bookstores. We also work closely with our campus partners to ensure that each campus store maintains unique aspects of in-store merchandising, including localized product assortments and specific styles and designs that reflect each campus's brand. We leverage Fanatics' e-commerce technology and expertise for the operational management of the emblematic merchandise and gift sections of our campus store websites. Lids manages in-store assortment planning and merchandising of emblematic apparel, headwear, and gift products for our partner campus stores, and Lids owns the inventory it manages, relieving us of the obligation to finance inventory purchases from working capital.</p>
<h2>Financing Arrangements and Strategic Review</h2>
<p>Pursuant to the July 28, 2023 Credit Agreement amendment, the Board established a committee consisting of three independent directors to explore, consider, solicit expressions of interest or proposals for, respond to any communications, inquiries or proposals regarding, and advise as to all strategic alternatives to effect a "Specified Liquidity Transaction" (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The Board continues its ongoing review of a broad range of strategic alternatives available to the Company, including but not limited to potential capital raises, asset divestitures, a sale of the business, and pursuit of standalone growth plans. The Board has not set a timetable for the conclusion of this review, nor has it made any decisions</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<p>related to any further actions at this time. There can be no assurance that the review will result in any transaction or other strategic change or outcome.</p>
<h2>Cost Savings Initiative</h2>
<p>During Fiscal 2023, we implemented a significant cost reduction program designed to streamline our operations, maximize productivity and drive profitability. We reduced our workforce, eliminated duplicate administrative headcounts at all levels, implemented improved system development processes to reduce maintenance costs, reduced capital expenditures, and evaluated operating contractual obligations for cost savings. Over the course of Fiscal 2024, we have achieved annualized savings of approximately $30 million to $35 million from the Fiscal 2023 cost savings initiatives. Additionally, during Fiscal 2024, Management's plan to implement further cost savings measures, including reduction of gross capital expenditures, amounting to approximately $25 million, of which approximately $18 million has been achieved during the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024. Management believes that these plans are within its control and will be focused on implementing these cost savings measures.</p>
<h2>Segments</h2>
<p>During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, assets related to our Digital Student Solutions ("DSS") Segment met the criteria for classification as Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations and is no longer a reportable segment. On May 31, 2023, we completed the sale of these assets related to our DSS Segment for cash proceeds of $20 million, net of certain transaction fees, severance costs, escrow, and other considerations. During the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024, we recorded a Gain on Sale of Business of $3.5 million in Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net, related to the sale. Net cash proceeds from the sale were used for debt repayment and provided additional funds for working capital needs under our Credit Facility. For additional information, see Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.</p>
<p>We have two reportable segments: Retail and Wholesale. Additionally, unallocated shared-service costs, which include various corporate level expenses and other governance functions, are not allocated to a specific reporting segment and continue to be presented as "Corporate Services".</p>
<p>We identify our segments in accordance with the way our business is managed (focusing on the financial information distributed) and the manner in which our chief operating decision maker allocates resources and assesses financial performance. The following summarizes the three segments. For additional information about each segment's operations, see Part I - Item 1. Business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2023 .</p>
<h2>Retail Segment</h2>
<p>The Retail Segment operates 1,272 college, university, and K-12 school bookstores, comprised of 717 physical bookstores and 555 virtual bookstores. Our bookstores typically operate under agreements with the college, university, or K-12 schools to be the official bookstore and the exclusive seller of course materials and supplies, including physical and digital products. The majority of the physical campus bookstores have school-branded e-commerce websites which we operate independently or along with our merchant service providers, and which offer students access to affordable course materials and affinity products, including emblematic apparel and gifts. The Retail Segment offers our BNC First Day equitable and inclusive access programs, consisting of First Day Complete and First Day , which provide faculty required course materials on or before the first day of class at below market rates, as compared to the total retail price for the same course materials if purchased separately (a la carte) and students are billed the below market rate directly by the institution as a course charge or included in tuition. Additionally, the Retail Segment offers a suite of digital content and services to colleges and universities, including a variety of open educational resource-based courseware. ®</p>
<p>During the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024, we opened 41 stores and closed 135 stores in the Retail Segment with estimated net annual sales of $65 million as we pruned some under-performing, less profitable stores, satellite stores, and certain other contracts were awarded to competitors. We have seen many institutions adopt First Day Complete in Fiscal 2024 and plan to continue to scale the number of schools adopting First Day Complete in Fiscal 2025 and beyond. These programs have allowed us to reverse historical long-term trends in course materials revenue declines as the growth of our BNC First Day programs offsets declines in a la carte courseware sales and closed store sales.</p>
<h2>Wholesale Segment</h2>
<p>The Wholesale Segment is comprised of our wholesale textbook business and is one of the largest textbook wholesalers in the country. The Wholesale Segment centrally sources, sells, and distributes new and used textbooks to approximately 2,900 physical bookstores (including our Retail Segment's 717 physical bookstores) and sources and distributes new and used textbooks to our 555 virtual bookstores. Additionally, the Wholesale Segment sells hardware and a software suite of applications that provides inventory management and point-of-sale solutions to approximately 325 college bookstores.</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<p>Corporate Services represents unallocated shared-service costs which include corporate level expenses and other governance functions, including executive functions, such as accounting, legal, treasury, information technology, and human resources.</p>
<h2>Seasonality</h2>
<p>Our business is highly seasonal. For example, our retail business is seasonal, particularly with respect to textbook sales and rentals, with the major portion of sales and operating profit realized during the second and third fiscal quarters when college students generally purchase and rent textbooks for the upcoming semesters and lowest in the first and fourth fiscal quarters. Our quarterly results also may fluctuate depending on the timing of the start of the various schools' semesters, the revenue impact of accounting principles with respect to the recognition of revenue associated with our equitable and inclusive access programs, the ability to secure inventory on a timely basis, as well as shifts in our fiscal calendar dates. These shifts in timing may affect the comparability of our results across periods. Sales attributable to our wholesale business are generally highest in our first, second and third quarters, as it sells textbooks and other course materials for retail distribution. See Revenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue discussion below.</p>
<p>Retail product revenue is recognized when the customer takes physical possession of our products, which occurs either at the point of sale for products purchased at physical locations or upon receipt of our products by our customers for products ordered through our websites and virtual bookstores. Revenue from the sale of digital textbooks, which contains a single performance obligation, is recognized at the point of sale as product revenue in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Revenue from the rental of physical textbooks is deferred and recognized over the rental period based on the passage of time commencing at the point of sale, when control of the product transfers to the customer and is recognized as rental income in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Depending on the product mix offered under the BNC First Day offerings, revenue recognized is consistent with our policies for product, digital and rental sales, net of an anticipated opt-out or return provision.</p>
<p>Given the growth of BNC First Day programs, the timing of cash collection from our school partners may shift to periods subsequent to when the revenue is recognized. When a school adopts our BNC First Day equitable and inclusive access offerings, cash collection from the school generally occurs after the institution's drop/add dates, which is later in the working capital cycle, particularly in our third quarter given the timing of the Spring Term and our quarterly reporting period, as compared to direct-to-student point-of-sale transactions where cash is generally collected during the point-of-sale transaction or within a few days from the credit card processor. As a higher percentage of our sales shift to BNC First Day equitable and inclusive access offerings, we are focused on efforts to better align the timing of our cash outflows to course material vendors and schools with cash inflows collected from schools. As the concentration of digital product sales increases, revenue will be recognized earlier during the academic term as digital textbook revenue is recognized when the customer accesses the digital content compared to: (i) the rental of physical textbook where revenue is recognized over the rental period, and (ii) ala carte courseware sales where revenue is recognized when the customer takes physical possession of our products, which occurs either at the point of sale for products purchased at physical locations or upon receipt of our products by our customers for products ordered through our websites and virtual bookstores.</p>
<p>Sales attributable to our wholesale business are generally highest in our first, second and third quarters, as it sells textbooks and other course materials for retail distribution.</p>
<h2>Trends, Competition and Other Business Conditions Affecting Our Business</h2>
<p>The market for educational materials continues to undergo significant changes. As tuition and other costs rise, colleges and universities face increasing pressure to attract and retain students and provide them with innovative, affordable educational content and tools that support their educational development. Current trends, competition and other factors affecting our business include:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Overall Capital Markets, Economic Environment, College Enrollment and Consumer Spending Patterns. Our business is affected by capital markets, the overall economic environment, funding levels at colleges and universities, by changes in enrollments at colleges and universities, and spending on course materials and general merchandise.</li>
<li>· Capital Market Trends : We may require additional capital in the future to sustain or grow our business, including implementation of our strategic initiatives. The future availability of financing will depend on a variety of factors, such as economic and market conditions, and the availability of credit. These factors have and could continue to materially adversely affect our costs of borrowing, and our financial position and results of operations would be adversely impacted. Volatility in global financial markets may also limit our ability to access the capital markets at a time when we would like, or need, to raise capital, which could have an impact on our ability to react to changing economic and business conditions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<ul>
<li>· Economic Environment: Retail general merchandise sales are subject to short-term fluctuations driven by the broader retail environment and other economic factors, such as interest rate fluctuations and inflationary considerations. Broader macro-economic global supply chain issues could impact our ability to source textbooks, school supplies and general merchandise sold in our campus bookstores, including technology-related products and emblematic clothing. Union and labor market issues may also impact our ability to provide services and products to our customers. A significant reduction in U.S. economic activity could lead to decreased consumer spending.</li>
<li>· Enrollment Trends: The growth of our business depends on our ability to attract new customers and to increase the level of engagement by our current customers. In the Fall of 2023, we observed increased enrollment trends. Enrollment trends, specifically at community colleges, generally correlate with changes in the economy and unemployment factors, e.g., low unemployment tends to lead to low enrollment and higher unemployment rates tend to lead to higher enrollment trends, as students generally enroll to obtain skills that are in demand in the workforce. Additionally, enrollment trends are impacted by the dip in the United States birth rate resulting in fewer students at the traditional 18-24 year-old college age. Online degree program enrollments continue to grow, even in the face of declining overall higher education enrollment.</li>
<li>· Increased Use of Open Educational Resources ("OER"), Online and Digital Platforms as Companions or Alternatives to Traditional Course Materials, Including Artificial Intelligence ("AI") Technologies. Students and faculty can now choose from a wider variety of educational content and tools than ever before, delivered across both print and digital platforms.</li>
<li>· Increasing Costs Associated with Defending Against Security Breaches and Other Data Loss, Including Cyber-Attacks. We are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems, infrastructure and data. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. We continue to invest in data protection, including insurance, and information technology to prevent or minimize these risks and, to date, we have not experienced any material service interruptions and are not aware of any material breaches.</li>
<li>· Distribution Network Evolving. The way course materials are distributed and consumed is changing significantly, a trend that is expected to continue. The market for course materials, including textbooks and supplemental materials, is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change.</li>
<li>· Disintermediation . We are experiencing growing competition from alternative media and alternative sources of textbooks and other course materials. In addition to the official physical or virtual campus bookstore, course materials are also sold through off-campus bookstores, e-commerce outlets, digital platform companies, and publishers, including Cengage, Pearson and McGraw Hill, bypassing the bookstore distribution channel by selling or renting directly to students and educational institutions, including student-to-student transactions over the Internet, and multi-title subscription access.</li>
<li>· Suppliers, Supply Chain and Inventory. The products that we sell originate from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors. During Fiscal 2023, our four largest retail suppliers, excluding our wholesale business which fulfills orders for all our physical and virtual bookstores, accounted for approximately 28% of our merchandise purchased, with the largest supplier accounting for approximately 8% of our merchandise purchased. Since the demand for used textbooks has historically been greater than the available supply, our financial results are highly dependent upon Wholesale's ability to build its textbook inventory from suppliers in advance of the selling season. In Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2022, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of fewer students on campus, and the resulting increase in transition to digital materials, has significantly impacted our on-campus buyback programs which supplies Wholesale's used textbook inventory for future selling periods. Some textbook publishers have begun to supply textbooks pursuant to consignment or rental programs which could impact used textbook supplies in the future. Additionally, Wholesale is a national distributor for rental textbooks offered through McGraw-Hill Education's and Pearson Education's consignment rental program. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content or services, particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits. If our current suppliers were to stop selling merchandise, content or services to us on acceptable terms, including as a result of one or more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions or refusal by such suppliers to ship products to us due to delayed or extended payment windows as a result of our own liquidity constraints, we may be unable to procure the same merchandise, content or services from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable terms, or at all. Additionally, delayed or incomplete publisher shipments of physical textbook orders, or delays in receiving digital courseware access codes, could have an adverse impact on sales, including our First Day Complete equitable access program, which relies upon timely receipt of inventory in advance of class start dates each academic term. The broader macro-economic global supply chain issues may also impact our ability to source school supplies and general merchandise sold in our campus bookstores, including technology-related products and emblematic clothing.</li>

<ul>
<li>· Price Competition. In addition to the competition in the services we provide to our customers, our textbook and other course materials business faces significant price competition. Students purchase textbooks and other course materials from multiple providers, are highly price sensitive, and can easily shift spending from one provider or format to another.</li>
<li>· First Day Complete and First Day Models. Offering course materials sales through our equitable and inclusive access First Day Complete and First Day models is a key, and increasingly important, strategic initiative of ours to meet the market demands of substantially reduced pricing to students. Our First Day Complete and First Day programs contribute to improved student outcomes, while increasing our market share, revenue and relative gross profits of course materials sales given the higher volumes of units sold in such models as compared to historical sales models that rely on individual student marketing and sales. These programs have allowed us to reverse historical long-term trends in course materials revenue declines as the growth of our BNC First Day programs offsets declines in a la carte courseware sales and closed store sales. We are moving quickly and decisively to accelerate our First Day Complete strategy. While we have seen many institutions adopt First Day Complete in Fiscal 2024 and plan to continue to scale the number of schools adopting First Day Complete in Fiscal 2025 and beyond, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to achieve these plans within these timeframes or at all. Additionally, the United States Department of Education has recently proposed regulatory changes that, if adopted as proposed, could impact equitable and inclusive access models across the higher education industry.</li>
<li>· A Large Number of Traditional Campus Bookstores Have Yet to be Outsourced.</li>
<li>· Outsourcing Trends. We continue to see the trend towards outsourcing in the campus bookstore market and also continue to see a variety of business models being pursued for the provision of course materials (such as equitable and inclusive access programs and publisher subscription models) and general merchandise.</li>
<li>· New and Existing Bookstore Contracts . We expect awards of new accounts resulting in new physical and virtual store openings will continue to be an important driver of future growth in our business. We also expect that certain less profitable or non-essential bookstores we operate may close, as we focus on the profitability of our stores. The scope of any such store closures remains uncertain, although we are not aware, at this time, of any significant volume of stores which we operate that are likely to close or have informed us of upcoming closures. The growth of our BNC First Day programs offsets declines in a la carte courseware sales and closed store sales. We are moving quickly and decisively to accelerate our First Day Complete strategy.</li>

<h2>Elements of Results of Operations</h2>
<p>Our condensed consolidated financial statements reflect our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP"). The results of operations reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.</p>
<p>During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2023, assets related to our DSS Segment met the criteria for classification as Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations. Certain assets and liabilities associated with the DSS Segment are presented in our condensed consolidated balance sheets as current "Assets Held for Sale" and current "Liabilities Held for Sale". The results of operations related to the DSS Segment are included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as "Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax." The cash flows of the DSS Segment are also presented separately in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.</p>
<p>Our sales are primarily derived from the sale of course materials, which include new, used, rental and digital textbooks. Additionally, at college and university bookstores which we operate, we sell general merchandise, including emblematic apparel and gifts, trade books, computer products, school and dorm supplies, convenience and café items and graduation products. Our rental income is primarily derived from the rental of physical textbooks. We also derive revenue from other sources, such as sales of inventory management, hardware and point-of-sale software, and other services.</p>
<p>Our cost of sales primarily includes costs such as merchandise costs, textbook rental amortization, warehouse costs related to inventory management and order fulfillment, insurance, certain payroll costs, and management service agreement costs, including rent expense, related to our college and university contracts and other facility related expenses.</p>
<p>Our selling and administrative expenses consist primarily of store payroll and store operating expenses. Selling and administrative expenses also include long-term incentive plan compensation expense and general office expenses, such as merchandising, procurement, field support, and finance and accounting. Shared-service costs such as human resources, legal, treasury, information technology, and various other corporate level expenses and other governance functions, are not allocated</p>

<p>During the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024, we opened 41 stores and closed 135 stores in the Retail Segment, with estimated net annual sales of $65 million as we pruned some under-performing, less profitable stores, satellite stores, and certain other contracts were awarded to competitors. We have seen many institutions adopt First Day Complete in Fiscal 2024 and plan to continue to scale the number of schools adopting First Day Complete in Fiscal 2025 and beyond.</p>
<p>Generally, sales are impacted by revenue from net new/closed stores, conversion to BNC First Day programs, increased campus traffic, and an increase in the number of on campus activities and events, such as graduations, athletic events, alumni events and prospective student campus tours.</p>

<h2>Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales</h2>
<p>To supplement the Total Sales table presented above, the Company uses Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales as a key performance indicator. Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales includes sales from physical and virtual stores that have been open for an entire fiscal year period and does not include sales from permanently closed stores for all periods presented. For Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales, sales for logo general merchandise fulfilled by Lids, Fanatics and digital agency sales are included on a gross basis in Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales compared to a net basis as commission revenue in our condensed consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p>We believe the current Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales calculation method reflects management's view that such comparable store sales are an important measure of the growth in sales when evaluating how established stores have performed over time. We present this metric as additional useful information about the Company's operational and financial performance and to allow greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by management for operating and financial decision-making. Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales are also referred to as "same-store" sales by others within the retail industry and the method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable store sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies and is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP.</p>
<p>The increase in course material sales was primarily due to the growth of BNC First Day equitable and inclusive access programs (as discussed above), offset by declines in a la carte courseware sales. The decrease in general merchandise sales are primarily related to lower logo product sales, as well as lower trade books and cafe and convenience product sales, offset by higher graduation and supplies product sales.</p>

<p>Our operating loss was $(5.0) million during the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024, compared to $(32.0) million during the 39 weeks ended January 28, 2023. The decrease in operating loss is due to the matters discussed above. For the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024, operating income, excluding the $5.8 million of impairment loss (non-cash) and the $12.3 million of restructuring and other charges, discussed above, was $13.1 million (or 1.0% of sales). For the 39 weeks ended January 28, 2023, operating loss, excluding the $6.0 million of impairment loss (non-cash) and the $4.8 million of restructuring and other charges, discussed above, was $(21.2) million (or (1.6)% of sales).</p>

<p>We recorded an income tax expense of $0.2 million on pre-tax loss of $(9.7) million during the 13 weeks ended January 27, 2024, which represented an effective income tax rate of (2.4)% and we recorded an income tax expense of $0.1 million on a pre-tax loss of $(22.0) million during the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2023, which represented an effective income tax rate of (0.6)%.</p>
<p>We recorded an income tax expense of $0.5 million on pre-tax loss of $(34.5) million during the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024, which represented an effective income tax rate of (1.5)% and we recorded an income tax expense of $0.6 million on a pre-tax loss of $(47.7) million during the 39 weeks ended January 28, 2023, which represented an effective income tax rate of (1.3)%.</p>
<p>The effective tax rate for the 13 weeks ended January 27, 2024 is lower than the prior year comparable period due to immaterial return to provision adjustments recorded in the prior year period.

<p>Adjusted Earnings (non-GAAP) is $(0.7) million during the 13 weeks ended January 27, 2024, compared with $(12.0) million during the 13 weeks ended January 28, 2023. Adjusted Earnings (non-GAAP) is $(16.9) million during the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024, compared with $(37.5) million during the 39 weeks ended January 28, 2023. See Adjusted Earnings (non-GAAP) discussion below.</p>
<h2>Use of Non-GAAP Measures - Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA by Segment, and Free Cash Flow</h2>
<p>To supplement our results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), we use the measure of Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA by Segment, and Free Cash Flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures under Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") regulations. We define Adjusted Earnings as net income from continuing operations adjusted for certain reconciling items that are subtracted from or added to net income (loss) from continuing operations. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) from continuing operations plus (1) depreciation and amortization; (2) interest expense and (3) income taxes, (4) as adjusted for items that are subtracted from or added to net income (loss) from continuing operations. We define Free Cash Flow as Cash Flows from Operating Activities less capital expenditures, cash interest and cash taxes.</p>
<p>To properly and prudently evaluate our business, we encourage you to review our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10Q, the reconciliation of Adjusted Earnings to net income (loss) from continuing operations, the reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated net income (loss) from continuing operations, and the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA by Segment to net income (loss) from continuing operations by segment, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, set forth in the tables below. All of the items included in the reconciliations below are either (i) non-cash items or (ii) items that management does not consider in assessing our on-going operating performance.</p>
<p>These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as substitutes for and should not be considered superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our use of these non-GAAP financial measures may be different from similarly named measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes.</p>
<p>We review these non-GAAP financial measures as internal measures to evaluate our performance at a consolidated level and at a segment level and manage our operations. We believe that these measures are useful performance measures which are used by us to facilitate a comparison of our on-going operating performance on a consistent basis from period-to-period. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than measures under GAAP can provide alone, as they exclude certain items that management believes do not reflect the ordinary performance of our operations in a particular period. Our Board of Directors and management also use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by Segment, at a consolidated and at a segment level, as one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting expected performance, for evaluating on a quarterly and annual basis actual results against such expectations, and as a measure for performance incentive plans. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA by Segment to determine segment capital allocations. We believe that the inclusion of Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA by Segment provides investors useful and important information regarding our operating results, in a manner that is consistent with management's evaluation of business performance. We believe that Free Cash Flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements and assists investors in their understanding of our operating profitability and liquidity as we manage the business to maximize margin and cash flow.</p>

<p>Given the growth of our BNC First Day programs, the timing of cash collection from our school partners may shift to periods subsequent to when the revenue is recognized. When a school adopts our BNC First Day equitable and inclusive access offerings, cash collection from the school generally occurs after the institution's drop/add dates, which is later in the working capital cycle, particularly in our third quarter given the timing of the Spring Term and our quarterly reporting period, as compared to direct-to-student point-of-sale transactions where cash is generally collected during the point-of-sale transaction or within a few days from the credit card processor. As a higher percentage of our sales shift to BNC First Day equitable and inclusive access offerings, we are focused on efforts to better align the timing of our cash outflows to course material vendors with cash inflows collected from schools.</p>

<p>The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern. This presentation contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business and does not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of the uncertainties described below.</p>
<p>Pursuant to ASC 205-40, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern ("ASC 205-40") , management must evaluate whether there are conditions and events, considered in aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that these condensed consolidated financial statements are issued. In accordance with ASC 205-40, management's analysis can only include the potential mitigating impact of management's plans that have not been fully implemented as of the issuance date of these condensed consolidated financial statements if (a) it is probable that management's plans will be effectively implemented on a timely basis, and (b) it is probable that the plans, when implemented, will alleviate the relevant conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.</p>

<p>Our primary sources of cash are net cash flows from operating activities, funds available under our Credit Agreement, Term Loan Agreement, and short-term vendor financing. Our liquidity is highly dependent on the seasonal nature of our business, particularly with respect to course material sales, as sales are generally highest in the second and third fiscal quarters, when college students generally purchase textbooks for the upcoming Fall and Spring semesters, respectively. As of January 27, 2024, we had $15.0 million of cash on hand, including $6.9 million of restricted cash primarily related to segregated funds for commission due to Lids for logo merchandise sales as per the F/L Relationship-related agreements.</p>
<p>Our business was significantly negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during the years ended April 30, 2022 and May 1, 2021, as many schools adjusted their learning models and on-campus activities. Although most academic institutions have since reopened after the COVID-19 pandemic, the lingering impacts of the pandemic have resulted in changes in customer behaviors, lower enrollments, and an evolving educational landscape, including increased competition and disintermediation, which continued to impact our financial results during the year ended April 29, 2023. Some institutions are still providing alternatives to traditional in-person instruction, including online and hybrid learning options and significantly reduced classroom sizes. The impact of COVID-19 store closings, as well as lower earnings during the year ended April 29, 2023, resulted in the loss of cash flows and increased borrowings that we would not otherwise have expected to incur.</p>
<p>We recognized Net Loss from Continuing Operations of $(9.9) million and $(22.1) million for the 13 weeks endedJanua ry 27, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively, and a Net Loss from Continuing Operations of $(35.0) million and $(48.3) million for the 39 weeks ended Januar y 27, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively, and we incurred a Net Loss from Continuing Operations of $(90.1) million, $(61.6) million, and $(133.6) million for the years ended April 29, 2023, April 30, 2022, and May 1, 2021, respectively. Our Cash Flow (Used In) Provided by Operating Activities from Continuing Operations were $(83.2) million and $(21.2) million for the 39 weeks ended J anuary 27, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively, and were $90.5 million, $(16.2) million, and $27.0 million, for the years ended April 29, 2023, April 30, 2022, and May 1, 2021, respectively. Th e tightening of our available credit commitments, including the elimination and repayment of our FILO Facility in fiscal year 2023 of $40.0 million, had a significant impact on our liquidity during fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2024, including our ability to make timely vendor payments and school commission payments.</p>
<p>Our losses and projected cash needs, combined with our current liquidity levels and the maturity of our Credit Facility, which becomes due on December 28, 2024, raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is contingent upon the successful execution of management's plan to improve the Company's liquidity, including (1) raising additional liquidity and (2) continuing to take additional operational restructuring actions to achieve the required levels of liquidity to support the operations of the business.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the July 28, 2023 Credit Agreement amendment, the Board established a committee consisting of three independent directors to explore, consider, solicit expressions of interest or proposals for, respond to any communications, inquiries or proposals regarding, and advise as to all strategic alternatives to effect a "Specified Liquidity Transaction" (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The Board continues its ongoing review of a broad range of strategic alternatives available to the Company, including but not limited to potential capital raises, asset divestitures, a sale of the business, and pursuit of standalone growth plans. The Board has not set a timetable for the conclusion of this review, nor has it made any decisions related to any further actions at this time. There can be no assurance that the review will result in any transaction or other strategic change or outcome.</p>

<h2>Operational restructuring plans</h2>
<p>During Fiscal 2023, we implemented a significant cost reduction program designed to streamline our operations, maximize productivity and drive profitability. We reduced our workforce, eliminated duplicate administrative headcounts at all levels, implemented improved system development processes to reduce maintenance costs, reduced capital expenditures, and evaluated operating contractual obligations for cost savings. Over the course of Fiscal 2024, we have achieved annualized savings of approximately $30 million to $35 million from the Fiscal 2023 cost savings initiatives. Additionally, during Fiscal 2024, Management's plan to implement further cost savings measures, including reduction of gross capital expenditures, amounting to approximately $25 million, of which approximately $18 million has been achieved during the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024. Management believes that these plans are within its control and will be focused on implementing these cost savings measures.</p>

<h2>Sources and Uses of Cash Flow - Continuing Operations</h2>
<p>| | 39 weeks ended | 39 weeks ended |
| --- | --- | --- |

| Net cash flows used in operating activities from continuing operations | $ (83,221) | $ (21,248) |

| Net change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash from continuing operations | $ (34,709) | $ 14,046 |</p>
<p>As of January 27, 2024 and January 28, 2023, we had restricted cash of $6.9 million and $18.3 million, respectively, comprised of $6.0 million and $17.4 million, respectively, in prepaid and other current assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet related to segregated funds for commission due to Lids for logo merchandise sales as per the Lids service provider merchandising agreement and $0.9 million for both periods in other noncurrent assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet related to amounts held in trust for future distributions related to employee benefit plans.</p>
<h2>Cash Flow from Operating Activities from Continuing Operations</h2>
<p>Our business is highly seasonal. For our retail operations, cash flows from operating activities are typically a source of cash in the second and third fiscal quarters, when students generally purchase and rent textbooks and other course materials for the upcoming semesters based on the typical academic semester. Given the growth of our BNC First Day programs, the timing of cash collection from our school partners may shift to periods subsequent to when the revenue is recognized. When a school adopts our BNC First Day equitable and inclusive access offerings, cash collection from the school generally occurs after the institution's drop/add dates, which is later in the working capital cycle, particularly in our third quarter given the timing of the Spring Term and our quarterly reporting period, as compared to direct-to-student pointof-sale transactions where cash is generally collected during the point-of-sale transaction or within a few days from the credit card processor. As a higher percentage of our sales shift to BNC First Day equitable and inclusive access offerings, we are focused on efforts to better align the timing of our cash outflows to course material vendors with cash inflows collected from schools. For our wholesale operations, cash flows from operating activities are typically a source of cash in the second and third fiscal quarters, as payments are received from the summer and winter selling season when our wholesale business sell textbooks and other course materials for retail distribution. For both retail and wholesale, cash flows from operating activities are typically a use of cash in the fourth fiscal quarter, when sales volumes are materially lower than the other quarters. Our quarterly cash flows also may fluctuate depending on the timing of the start of the various school's semesters, as well as shifts in our fiscal calendar dates. These shifts in timing may affect the comparability of our results across periods.</p>
<p>Cash flows used in operating activities from continuing operations during the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024 were $(83.2) million compared to $(21.2) million during the 39 weeks ended January 28, 2023. This increase in cash flows used in operating activities from continuing operations of $62.0 million was primarily due to changes in working capital, including higher accounts receivables of $81.7 million and higher inventory levels of $88.2 million primarily related to our increased adoption of our BNC First Day equitable and inclusive access sales; higher payments for interest expense of $6.2 million; offset</p>
<p>by higher payables of $78.0 million due to delayed payments to vendors for inventory purchases and expenses, as a result of borrowing capacity limitations under our credit facility.</p>
<p>Cash Flow from Investing Activities from Continuing Operations</p>
<p>Cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations during the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024 were $(11.4) million compared to $(21.1) million during the 39 weeks ended January 28, 2023. The decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to lower capital expenditures and contractual capital investments, enhancements to internal systems and websites, and new store construction. Capital expenditures totaled $11.5 million and $21.7 million during the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024 and January 28, 2023, respectively.</p>
<h2>Cash Flow from Financing Activities from Continuing Operations</h2>
<p>Cash flows provided by financing activities from continuing operations during the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024 were $59.9 million compared to $56.4 million during the 39 weeks ended January 28, 2023. This net change of $3.5 million is primarily due to higher net borrowings of $10.0 million, partially offset by higher payments for deferred financing costs of $7.2 million.</p>

The debt issuance costs have been deferred and are presented as a reduction to long-term borrowings in the consolidated balance sheets, and subsequently amortized ratably over the term of the Term Loan Facility.</p>
<h2>July 2023 Term Loan Credit Agreement Amendment</h2>
<p>On July 28, 2023, we amended our Term Loan to (i) extend the maturity date of the Term Loan Agreement to April 7, 2025, (ii) allow for interest to be paid in kind until September 2, 2024, (iii) amend the 1.50% anniversary fee to recur on June 7 of each year that the Term Loan Agreement remains outstanding, with 2024 fee deferred to the earlier of September 2, 2024 and the Termination Date (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement) and (iv) amend certain negative covenants and affirmative and add certain additional covenants. We must pay a fee of $0.05 million to the lenders under the Term Loan Agreement on the earlier of September 2, 2024 and the Termination Date (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement). For additional information, see the Company's Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on July 28, 2023.</p>
<p>During the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024, we incurred debt issuance costs totaling $0.4 million related to the July 2023 Term Loan Credit Agreement amendment. The debt issuance costs have been deferred and are presented as a reduction to long-term borrowings in the consolidated balance sheets, and subsequently amortized ratably over the term of the Term Loan Facility.</p>
<p>The Term Loans accrue interest at a rate equal to 11.25%, payable quarterly. All interest on the Term Loan prior to July 29, 2023 was paid in cash. During the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023 and 13 weeks ended January 27, 2024, all interest on the Term Loan was incurred in kind as permitted under the July 2023 Term Loan Amendment. The Term Loans do not amortize prior to maturity.</p>
<p>The Term Loan Credit Agreement does not contain a financial covenant, but otherwise contains representations and warranties, covenants and events of default that are substantially the same as those in the Credit Agreement, including restrictions on the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to incur additional debt, incur or permit liens on assets, make investments and acquisitions, consolidate or merge with any other company, engage in asset sales and make dividends and distributions. The Term Loan Facility is secured by second-priority liens on all assets securing the obligations under the Credit Agreement, which is all of the assets of the Company and the Guarantors, subject to customary exclusions and limitations set forth in the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the other loan documents executed in connection therewith.</p>
<p>The Credit Agreement amendment permitted us to incur the Term Loan Facility and also provides that, upon repayment of the Term Loan Credit Agreement (and, if applicable, any replacement credit facility thereof), we may incur second lien secured debt in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $75.0 million.</p>
<h2>Deferred Financing Costs</h2>

<h2>Income Tax Implications on Liquidity</h2>
<p>For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022, we filed an application to change our tax year from January to April under the automatic consent provisions. As a result of the tax year-end change, there is no longer a long-term tax payable associated with the LIFO reserve in other long-term liabilities.</p>
<p>As of January 27, 2024, we recognized a current income tax receivable for net operating loss carrybacks in prepaid and other current assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. We received refunds of $7.8 million in Fiscal 2022 and a $15.8 million refund in Fiscal 2023. We received an $8.5 million refund (including $0.9 million in interest) on February 16, 2024 and we expect to receive additional refunds of approximately $2.4 million.</p>
<h2>Share Repurchases</h2>
<p>During the 13 and 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024, we did not repurchase any of our Common Stock under the stock repurchase program. As of January 27, 2024, approximately $26.7 million remains available under the stock repurchase program.</p>
<p>During the 13 and 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024, we repurchased 3,135 and 147,885 of our Common Stock, respectively, outside of the stock repurchase program in connection with employee tax withholding obligations for vested stock awards.</p>

<p>There have been no material changes to the items discussed in Part II - Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2023.</p>
<h2>Item 4: Controls and Procedures</h2>
<h2>Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures</h2>
<p>An evaluation (as required under Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act) was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's "disclosure controls and procedures" (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in the Company's periodic reports. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of January 27, 2024.</p>
<p>Management has not identified any changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.</p>
<h2>PART II - OTHER INFORMATION</h2>
<h2>Item 1. Legal Proceedings</h2>
<p>We are involved in a variety of claims, suits, investigations and proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, including actions with respect to contracts, intellectual property, taxation, employment, benefits, personal injuries and other matters. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Based on our current knowledge, we do not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that the final outcome of any pending or threatened legal proceedings to which we or any of our subsidiaries are a party, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our future financial results. However, legal matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. As such, there can be no assurance that the final outcome of these matters will not materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.</p>
<h2>Item 1A. Risk Factors</h2>
<p>There have been no material changes, except as noted below, during the 39 weeks ended January 27, 2024 to the risk factors discussed in Part I - Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 29, 2023.</p>
<p>We are not in compliance with the NYSE's minimum share price requirement and thus are at risk of the NYSE delisting shares of our Common Stock, which would have an adverse impact on the trading volume, liquidity and market price of shares of our Common Stock.</p>
<p>On February 27, 2024, we received a letter from NYSE notifying us that, for the last 30 consecutive business days, the bid price of our common stock had closed below $1.00 per share, the minimum closing bid price required by the continued listing requirements of Rule 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual. Pursuan t to Rule 802.01C of the NYSE Listed Company Manual, a company will be considered to be below compliance standards if the average closing price of a security fell below $1.00 over a period of 30 consecutive trading days. A company can regain compliance with the minimum share price requirement at any time during the sixmonth cure period if, on the last trading day of any calendar month during the cure period, the company has (i) a closing share price of at least $1.00 and (ii) an average closing share price of at least $1.00 over the 30 trading-day period ending on the last trading day of that month. In the event that at the expiration of the six-month cure period, both a $1.00 closing share price on the last trading day of the cure period and a $1.00 average closing share price over the 30 trading-day period ending on the last trading day of the cure period are not attained, the NYSE will commence suspension and delisting procedures. We intend to take remedial actions to cure such deficiency, including, but not limited to, undertaking a reverse stock split, should such action be necessary, subject to approval of our stockholders. However, we cannot assure you that these remedial actions will be successful and that we will be able to cure this deficiency or comply with other NYSE continued listing standards. A delisting of shares of our Common Stock from the NYSE could negatively impact us as it would likely reduce the liquidity and market price of shares of our Common Stock, reduce the number of investors willing to hold or acquire shares of our Common Stock, and negatively impact our ability to access equity markets and obtain financing.</p>
<h2>Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds</h2>
<h2>Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities</h2>
