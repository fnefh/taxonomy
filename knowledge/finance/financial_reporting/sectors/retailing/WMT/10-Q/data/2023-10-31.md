<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<h2>Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</h2>
<h2>Basis of Presentation</h2>
<p>The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of Walmart Inc. and its subsidiaries ("Walmart" or the "Company") and the accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are unaudited. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been included. Such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, and the accompanying notes, are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") and do not contain certain information included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 ("fiscal 2023"). Therefore, the interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with that Annual Report on Form 10-K.</p>
<p>The Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending January 31 for the United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations. The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag based on a calendar year. There were no significant intervening events during the month of October 2023 related to the consolidated operations using a lag that materially affected the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.</p>
<p>The Company's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as weather patterns. Historically, the Company's highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.</p>
<h2>Use of Estimates</h2>
<p>The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities. Management's estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ materially from those estimates.</p>
<h2>Supplier Financing Program Obligations</h2>
<p>In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations , which enhances the transparency about the use of supplier finance programs for investors and other allocators of capital. The Company adopted this ASU as of February 1, 2023, other than the roll-forward disclosure requirement which the Company will adopt in fiscal 2025.</p>
<p>The Company has supplier financing programs with financial institutions, in which the Company agrees to pay the financial institution the stated amount of confirmed invoices on the invoice due date for participating suppliers. Participation in these programs is optional and solely up to the supplier, who negotiates the terms of the arrangement directly with the financial institution and may allow early payment. Supplier participation in these programs has no bearing on the Company's amounts due. The payment terms that the Company has with participating suppliers under these programs generally range between 30 and 90 days. The Company does not have an economic interest in a supplier's participation in the program or a direct financial relationship with the financial institution funding the program. The Company is responsible for ensuring that participating financial institutions are paid according to the terms negotiated with the supplier, regardless of whether the supplier elects to receive early payment from the financial institution. The outstanding payment obligations to financial institutions under these programs were $6.1 billion, $5.2 billion and $5.4 billion, as of October 31, 2023, January 31, 2023 and October 31, 2022, respectively. These obligations are generally classified as accounts payable within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The activity related to these programs is classified as an operating activity within the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.</p>
<h2>Recent Accounting Pronouncements</h2>
<p>In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , which updates reportable segment disclosure requirements primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Management is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company's disclosures.</p>
<h2>Walmart Inc.</h2>
<h2>Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements</h2>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<h2>Note 2. Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share</h2>
<p>Basic net income (loss) per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share attributable to Walmart is based on the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the relevant period adjusted for the dilutive effect of share-based awards. The Company did not have significant share-based awards outstanding that were anti-dilutive and not included in the calculation of diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023 and the nine months ended October 31, 2022. The calculation of diluted net loss per common share attributable to Walmart for the three months ended October 31, 2022 does not include the effect of share-based payment awards as their inclusion would be anti-dilutive and would reduce the net loss per common share, and such awards were not significant.</p>
<p>The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used to determine basic and diluted net income (loss) per common share attributable to Walmart:</p>

<ul>
<li>· Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;</li>
<li>· Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and</li>
<li>· Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop its own assumptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Company measures the fair value of certain equity investments, including certain immaterial equity method investments where the Company has elected the fair value option, on a recurring basis within other long-term assets in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The amounts of gains and losses included in earnings from fair value changes for these investments are recognized within other gains and losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The fair value of these investments is as follows:</p>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Changes in the fair value of these investments were primarily due to gains and losses resulting from net changes in the underlying stock prices, along with certain other immaterial investment activity. These changes in fair value included net losses of $4.2 billion for both the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, and net losses of $3.6 billion and $4.8 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2022, respectively. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost and adjusted for any observable price changes or impairments within other gains and losses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.</p>
<h2>Derivatives</h2>
<p>The Company also has derivatives recorded at fair value. Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would receive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates. The fair values have been measured using the income approach and Level 2 inputs, which include the relevant interest rate and foreign currency forward curves. As of October 31, 2023 and January 31, 2023, the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows:</p>

<h2>Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements</h2>
<p>In addition to assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges. The Company did not have any material assets or liabilities resulting in nonrecurring fair value measurements as of October 31, 2023 in the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.</p>
<h2>Other Fair Value Disclosures</h2>
<p>The Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term borrowings at cost. The carrying values of these instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities.</p>
<p>The Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost. The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the Company's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The carrying value and fair value of the Company's long-term debt as of October 31, 2023 and January 31, 2023, are as follows:</p>

<h2>Note 6. Contingencies</h2>
<h2>Legal Proceedings</h2>
<p>The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters. The Company records a liability for those legal proceedings and regulatory matters when it determines it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company also discloses when it is reasonably possible that a material loss may be incurred. From time to time, the Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into settlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders.</p>
<p>Unless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the aggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<h2>Settlement Framework Regarding Multidistrict and State or Local Opioid-Related Litigation</h2>
<p>During fiscal 2023, the Company accrued a liability for approximately $3.3 billion for the Settlement Framework (described below) and other previously agreed upon state and tribal settlements. The Settlement Framework includes no admission of wrongdoing or liability by the Company, and the Company continues to believe it has substantial factual and legal defenses to opioids-related litigation. As of October 31, 2023, substantially all of the original approximately $3.3 billion accrued liability for the Settlement Framework and other settlements has been paid.</p>
<p>In December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a wide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, individuals, and third-party payers, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the "MDL") and is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the cases included in the MDL.</p>
<p>On November 15, 2022, the Company announced it had agreed to financial amounts and payment terms to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits filed against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes whether as part of the MDL (excluding, however, a single, two-county trial described further below) or in state court, as well as all potential claims that could be made against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes for up to approximately $3.1 billion (the "Settlement Amount"). The Settlement Amount includes amounts for remediation of alleged harms as well as attorneys' fees and costs and also includes some, but not all, amounts from previously agreed recent settlements by the Company. One settlement framework with corresponding conditions and participation thresholds applies for the states and political subdivisions, and another settlement framework with corresponding conditions and participation thresholds applies for the Native American tribes. Both settlement frameworks are referred to collectively as the "Settlement Framework."</p>
<p>The Settlement Framework, among other applicable conditions, provides that payments to states and political subdivisions are contingent upon the number of states and political subdivisions, including those states and political subdivisions who have not yet sued the Company, that agree to participate in the Settlement Framework or otherwise have their claims foreclosed within a prescribed deadline. On December 20, 2022, the Company announced that it had settlement agreements with all 50 states, including four states that previously settled with the Company, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and three other U.S. territories (the "Settling States"), thus satisfying the initial threshold of required participation by Settling States. On August 22, 2023, the settlement administrator determined that a sufficient number of political subdivisions had agreed to participate in the Settlement Framework, which was a necessary condition for the Settlement Framework to become effective. The Settlement Framework became effective 15 days later, on September 6, 2023. The Company deposited the full portion of the Settlement Amount attributable to the Settling States on October 11, 2023. Although the settlement administrator has determined that sufficient number of political subdivisions have agreed to participate in the Settlement Framework, and thus the Settlement Framework was effective, eligible political subdivisions still have until July 15, 2025, to join the Settlement Framework.</p>
<h2>Other Opioid-Related Litigation</h2>
<p>The Company will continue to vigorously defend against any opioid-related litigation not covered or otherwise resolved by the Settlement Framework, including, but not limited to, each of the matters described below; any other actions filed by healthcare providers, individuals, and third-party payers; and any action filed by a political subdivision or Native American tribe that is not resolved by the Settlement Framework. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued a liability for these opioid-related litigation matters nor can the Company reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these matters. The Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of any of these matters and no assurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected.</p>
<p>Two-County Trial and MDL Bellwethers; Canada; and Other Litigation. The liability phase of a single, two-county trial in one of the MDL cases resulted in a jury verdict on November 23, 2021, finding in favor of the plaintiffs as to the liability of all defendants, including the Company. The abatement phase of the single, twocounty trial resulted in a judgment on August 17, 2022, that ordered all three defendants, including the Company, to pay an aggregate amount of approximately $0.7 billion over fifteen years, on a joint and several liability basis, and granted the plaintiffs injunctive relief. On September 7, 2022, the Company filed an appeal with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The monetary aspect of the judgment is stayed pending appeal, and the injunctive aspect of the judgment went into effect on February 20, 2023. On September 11, 2023, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order of certifying certain questions in the appeal for review by the Supreme Court of Ohio.</p>
<p>The MDL designated five additional single-county cases as bellwethers to proceed through discovery; however, thesefive counties have elected to participate in the Settlement Framework and receive a portion of the Settlement Amount rather than go to trial. On October 25, 2023, the MDL designated four cases brought by thirdparty payers as bellwether cases to proceed through discovery. Additional bellwethers of cases brought by hospitals and other healthcare providers may be designated in the future.</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<p>Wal-Mart Canada Corp. and certain other subsidiaries of the Company have been named as defendants intwo putative class action complaints filed in Canada related to dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids. These matters remain pending.</p>
<p>Similar cases that name the Company also have been filed in state and federal courts by state, local, and tribal governments, healthcare providers, and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs in these cases and in the MDL are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information requests, and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids.</p>
<p>DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation. On December 22, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") filed a civil complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled substances from its pharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies. The complaint alleges that this conduct resulted in violations of the Controlled Substances Act. The DOJ is seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief. The Company initially moved to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. After that motion was fully briefed, the DOJ filed an amended complaint on October 7, 2022. On November 7, 2022, the Company filed a partial motion to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending.</p>
<p>Opioid-Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation. In addition, the Company is the subject of two securities class actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January 20, 2021 and March 5, 2021, purportedly on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. Those cases have been consolidated. On October 8, 2021, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated securities action. After the parties had fully briefed the motion to dismiss, on September 9, 2022, the Court entered an order permitting the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint, which was filed on October 14, 2022, and which revised the applicable putative class of investors to those who acquired Walmart stock from March 31, 2017, through December 22, 2020. On November 16, 2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending.</p>
<p>Derivative actions were also filed by two of the Company's shareholders in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on February 9, 2021 and April 16, 2021, alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain of its current and former directors with respect to oversight of the Company's distribution and dispensing of opioids and also alleging violations of the federal securities laws and other breaches of duty by current directors and two current officers in connection with the Company's opioids disclosures. Those cases have been stayed pending developments in other opioids litigation matters. On September 27, 2021, three shareholders filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that certain members of the Board of Directors and certain former officers breached their fiduciary duties in failing to adequately oversee the Company's prescription opioids business. The defendants moved to dismiss and/or to stay proceedings on December 21, 2021, and the plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. On April 20, 2022, the defendants moved to dismiss and/or to stay proceedings with respect to the amended complaint. In two orders issued on April 12 and 26, 2023, the Court of Chancery granted the defendants' motion to dismiss with respect to claims involving the Company's distribution practices and denied the remainder of the motion, including the Company's request to stay the litigation. On May 5, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") appointed an independent Special Litigation Committee (the "SLC") to investigate the allegations regarding certain current and former officers and directors named in the various derivative proceedings regarding oversight with respect to opioids. The Board has authorized the SLC to retain independent legal counsel and such other advisors as the SLC deems appropriate in carrying out its duties. The derivative matter pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery is stayed until the SLC completes its investigation.</p>
<h2>Other Legal Proceedings</h2>
<p>Asda Equal Value Claims. Asda, formerly a subsidiary of the Company, was and still is a defendant in certain equal value claims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester in the United Kingdom on behalf of current and former Asda store employees, as well as additional claims in the High Court of the United Kingdom (the "Asda Equal Value Claims"). Further claims may be asserted in the future. Subsequent to the divestiture of Asda in February 2021, the Company continues to oversee the conduct of the defense of these claims. While potential liability for these claims remains with Asda, the Company has agreed to provide indemnification with respect to certain of these claims up to a contractually determined amount. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise related to these proceedings. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters.</p>
<p>Money Transfer Agent Services Matters. The Company has responded to grand jury subpoenas issued by the United States Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on behalf of the DOJ seeking documents regarding the Company's consumer fraud prevention program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company's money transfer services, where Walmart is an agent. The most recent subpoena was issued in August 2020. Walmart's responses to DOJ's subpoenas have been complete since 2021. The Company continues to cooperate with and provide information and documents voluntarily in response to supplemental requests from the DOJ. The Company has also responded to civil investigative demands from the</p>
<p>United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") in connection with the FTC's investigation related to money transfers and the Company's anti-fraud program in its capacity as an agent. On June 28, 2022, the FTC filed a complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that Walmart violated the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule regarding its money transfer agent services and is requesting non-monetary relief and civil penalties. On August 29, 2022, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On March 27, 2023, the Court issued an opinion dismissing the FTC's claim under the Telemarketing Sales Rule and denying Walmart's motion to dismiss the claim under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. On April 12, 2023, Walmart filed a motion to certify the Court's March 27, 2023, order for interlocutory appeal. On June 30, 2023, the FTC filed an amended complaint against Walmart again asserting claims under the Federal Trade Commission Act and Telemarketing Sales Rule. On July 20, 2023, the Court denied Walmart's motion to certify the Court's March 27, 2023, order for interlocutory appeal, finding that it would be more orderly to consider a request for interlocutory appeal after a ruling on Walmart's motion to dismiss the amended complaint. Walmart's motion to dismiss the amended complaint was filed on August 11, 2023, and remains pending. The Company intends to vigorously defend these matters. However, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected.</p>
<p>Mexico Antitrust Matter . On October 6, 2023, the Comisión Federal de Competencia Económica of México ("COFECE") notified the main Mexican operating subsidiary of Wal-Mart de México, S.A.B. de C.V. ("Walmex"), a majority owned subsidiary of the Company, that COFECE's Investigatory Authority ("IA") had requested COFECE to initiate a quasi-judicial administrative process against Walmex's subsidiary for alleged relative monopolistic practices in connection with the supply and wholesale distribution of certain consumer goods, retail marketing practices of such consumer goods and related services. The quasi-judicial administrative process is the first opportunity for Walmex's subsidiary to respond to and defend against the IA's allegations before COFECE. While COFECE has the authority to impose monetary relief and/or non-structural conduct measures, such relief and conduct measures would be subject to appeal by Walmex's subsidiary. Walmex's subsidiary intends to defend against the allegations vigorously, both at the quasi-judicial administrative process and, if required, before any courts. Because this process is at an early stage, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these matters, cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise and can provide no assurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected.</p>
<h2>Note 7. Segments and Disaggregated Revenue</h2>
<h2>Segments</h2>
<p>The Company is engaged in the operation of retail and wholesale stores and clubs, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico. The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club. The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources. The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments. It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.</p>
<p>The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchandising concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce, which includes omni-channel initiatives and certain other business offerings such as advertising services through Walmart Connect. The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-channel initiatives. The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com and omni-channel initiatives. Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the Company's segments.</p>
<p>The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by its CODM. When the measurement of a segment significantly changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation.</p>
<p>Net sales by segment are as follows:</p>

<h2>Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations</h2>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This discussion, which presents Walmart Inc.'s ("Walmart," the "Company," "our," or "we") results for periods occurring in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2024 ("fiscal 2024") and the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 ("fiscal 2023"), should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, and the accompanying notes included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the year ended January 31, 2023, the accompanying notes and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2023.</p>
<p>We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors that accounted for those changes. We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company's performance. Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments of our business to provide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as a whole.</p>
<p>Throughout this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures. Management measures the results of the Company's segments using each segment's operating income, including certain corporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker.</p>
<p>Comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs for a particular period from the corresponding prior year period. Walmart's definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and clubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce sales. We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel transactions which are fulfilled through our stores and clubs as well as certain other business offerings that are part of our strategy, such as our Walmart Connect advertising business. Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable sales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store's retail square feet of more than five percent. Sales related to divested businesses are excluded from comparable sales, and sales related to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months. Comparable sales are also referred to as "same-store" sales by others within the retail industry. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.</p>
<p>In discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the operating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars. We calculate the effect of changes in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period's currency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period's currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange rate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months. Throughout our discussion, we refer to the results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Volatility in currency exchange rates may impact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the future.</p>
<p>Each of our segments contributes to the Company's operating results differently. Each, however, has generally maintained a relatively consistent contribution rate to the Company's net sales and operating income in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution rate for the Walmart International segment due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.</p>
<p>We operate in the highly competitive omni-channel retail industry in all of the markets we serve. We face strong sales competition from other discount, department, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, warehouse clubs and supermarkets, as well as eCommerce businesses and companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness, and financial services. Many of these competitors are national, regional or international chains or have a national or international omni-channel or eCommerce presence. We compete with a number of companies for attracting and retaining quality employees ("associates"). We, along with other retail companies, are influenced by a number of factors including, but not limited to: catastrophic events, weather and other risks related to climate change, global health epidemics, competitive pressures, consumer disposable income, consumer debt levels and buying patterns, consumer credit availability, disruptions in supply chain and inventory management, cost and availability of goods, currency exchange rate fluctuations, customer preferences, deflation, inflation, fuel and energy prices, general economic conditions, insurance costs, interest rates, labor availability and costs, tax rates, the imposition of tariffs, cybersecurity attacks and unemployment.</p>
<p>We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. However, like other retail companies, we have experienced continued inflation that impacts our merchandise costs. The impact to our net sales and gross profit margin is influenced in part by our pricing and merchandising strategies in response to cost increases. Those pricing strategies include, but are not limited to: absorbing cost increases instead of passing those cost increases on to our customers and members; reducing prices in certain merchandise categories; focusing on opening price points for certain food categories; and when necessary, passing cost increases on to our customers and members. Merchandising strategies include, but are not limited to: working with our suppliers to reduce product costs and share in absorbing cost increases; focusing on private label brands and smaller pack sizes; earlier-than-usual purchasing and in greater volumes or moderating purchasing in certain categories; and securing ocean carrier and container capacity. These strategies have and may continue to impact gross profit as a percentage of net sales.</p>
<p>Further information on the factors that can affect our operating results and on certain risks to our Company and an investment in our securities can be found herein under " Item 5. Other Information ."</p>
<p>We expect continued uncertainty in our business and the global economy due to pressure from inflation, a challenging macro environment, geopolitical conditions, supply chain disruptions, volatility in employment trends and consumer confidence. For a detailed discussion on results of operations by reportable segment, refer to " Results of Operations " below.</p>
<h2>Company Performance Metrics</h2>
<p>We are committed to helping customers save money and live better through everyday low prices, supported by everyday low costs. At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which we operate. We define our financial priorities as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Growth - serve customers through a seamless omni-channel experience;</li>
<li>· Margin - improve our operating income margin through productivity initiatives as well as category and business mix; and</li>
<li>· Returns - improve our Return on Investment ("ROI") through margin improvement and disciplined capital spend.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Growth</h2>
<p>Our objective of prioritizing growth means we will focus on serving customers and members however they want to shop through our omni-channel business model. This includes increasing comparable store and club sales through increasing membership at Sam's Club and through Walmart+, accelerating eCommerce sales growth and expansion of omni-channel initiatives that complement our strategy.</p>
<p>Comparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous year. The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar). To be consistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases. However, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our fiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. We focus on comparable sales in the U.S. as we believe it is a meaningful metric within the context of the U.S. retail market where there is a single currency, one inflationary market and generally consistent store and club formats from year to year.</p>
<p>Calendar comparable sales, as well as the impact of fuel, for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, were as follows:</p>

<p>Comparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 4.6% and 5.5% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The Walmart U.S. segment had comparable sales growth of 4.9% and 6.1% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, driven by growth in transactions combined with growth in average ticket, including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness. The increases were partially offset by a modest decrease in general merchandise sales. The Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.8% and 2.7% to comparable sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, which was primarily driven by store pickup and delivery.</p>
<p>Comparable sales at the Sam's Club segment increased 2.9% and 2.4% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively. Growth in comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket, including strong sales in</p>
<p>grocery and health and wellness. Comparable sales for the nine months were partially offset by lower fuel sales due to deflation in this category. The Sam's Club segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.4% and 1.6% to comparable sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, which was primarily driven by Curbside Pickup and Ship to Home.</p>
<h2>Margin</h2>
<p>Our objective of prioritizing margin focuses on growth with a focus on incremental margin accretion through a combination of productivity improvements as well as category and business mix. We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, manage inventory, and reduce costs, and we operate with discipline by managing expenses and optimizing the efficiency of how we work. Additionally, we focus on our mix of businesses, including the expansion of connected value streams with higher margins, such as advertising. Our objective is to achieve operating income leverage, which we define as growing operating income at a faster rate than net sales.</p>

<p>Gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit rate") increased 32 and 22 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily due to the timing of Flipkart's The Big Billion Days ("BBD") sales event in the Walmart International segment, which shifted from the third quarter of fiscal 2023 to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, a reduction in inflation related LIFO charges in the Sam's Club segment and a slight improvement in gross profit rate in the Walmart U.S. segment.</p>
<p>Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 182 and 70 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively. The decreases were primarily driven by the lapping of opioid-related legal settlements of $3.3 billion recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.</p>
<p>Operating income as a percentage of net sales increased 211 and 85 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, due to the factors described above.</p>
<h2>Returns</h2>
<p>As we execute our strategic priorities, focusing on high return investments that drive operating leverage, we believe our return on capital will improve over time. We measure return on capital with our return on investment and free cash flow metrics. In addition, we provide returns in the form of share repurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section.</p>
<p>Return on Assets and Return on Investment</p>
<p>We include Return on Assets ("ROA"), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. ("GAAP") and Return on Investment ("ROI") as metrics to assess returns on assets. While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a meaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets. Trends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts. ROA was 6.5% and 3.7% for the trailing twelve months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in ROA was primarily due to an increase in consolidated net income during the trailing twelve month period primarily due to lapping the opioid legal charges incurred in the prior year comparable period. ROI was 14.1% and 12.8% for the trailing twelve months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in ROI was the result of an increase in operating income primarily due to lapping the opioid legal charges incurred in the prior year comparable period, partially offset by an increase in average invested capital primarily due to higher purchases of property and equipment.</p>
<p>We define ROI as operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent expense for the trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period. We consider average invested capital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and amortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period.</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<p>Our calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that exclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. For example, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the numerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in accordance with GAAP most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI. ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net income for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain expense items and adds interest income; and adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, accounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital. Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we believe ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA. Although ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.</p>
<p>The calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP financial measure, is as follows:</p>

<h2>Free Cash Flow</h2>
<p>Free cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which measures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in evaluating the Company's financial performance. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for discussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating activities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.</p>
<p>We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment made in that period. Net cash provided by operating activities was $19.0 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2023, which represents an increase of $3.3 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase is primarily due to timing of certain payments and moderated levels of inventory purchases, partially offset by payment of the remaining accrued opioid legal charges. Free cash flow for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 was $4.3 billion, which represents an increase of $0.7 billion when compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in free cash flow is due to the increase in operating cash flows described above, partially offset by an increase of $2.6 billion in capital expenditures to support our investment strategy.</p>
<p>Walmart's definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations or payments made for business acquisitions. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.</p>
<p>Although other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company's free cash flow. As a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their free cash flow.</p>
<p>The following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by operating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as information regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.</p>

<p>Our total revenues, which are mostly comprised of net sales but also include membership and other income,incre ased $8.0 billion or 5.2% and $27.5 billion or 6.1% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments, which were driven by growth in transactions, combined with growth in average ticket, including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness, along with positive comparable sales in most of our international markets. Net sales were positively impacted by $1.4 billion and $1.7 billion of fluctuations in currency exchange rates for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively.</p>
<p>Gross profit rate increased 32 and 22 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily due to the shift in timing of the BBD sales event in the Walmart International segment, a reduction in inflation related LIFO charges in the Sam's Club segment and a slight improvement in gross profit rate in the Walmart U.S. segment.</p>
<p>Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 182 and 70 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The decreases were primarily driven by the lapping of opioid-related legal settlements of $3.3 billion recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.</p>
<p>Other gains and losses consist of certain non-operating items, such as the change in the fair value of our investments and gains or losses on business dispositions, which by their nature can fluctuate from period to period. The net increase of $1.1 billion and net decrease of $1.5 billion in other losses for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year, were primarily due to changes in the fair value of our equity and other investments driven by changes in their underlying stock prices.</p>
<p>Our effective income tax rate was 29.7% and 26.1% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, compared to (23.5)% and 32.4% for the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increase in effective tax rate for the three months ended October 31, 2023, when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year is primarily due to tax expense on a quarterly pre-tax loss during the third quarter of fiscal 2023, which included charges related to opioid-related legal settlements and net losses in fair value of our investments. The decrease in effective tax rate for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year was primarily due to the tax impact of charges associated with opioid-related legal settlements and net losses in fair value of our investments. Our effective income tax rate may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of factors including changes in our assessment of certain tax contingencies, valuation allowances, changes in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix and size of earnings among our U.S. operations and international operations, which are subject to statutory rates that may be different than the U.S. statutory rate.</p>
<p>As a result of the factors discussed above, consolidated net income increased $2.4 billion and $5.1 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. Additionally, net income attributable to noncontrolling interest increased $0.2 billion and $0.5 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, which included stronger results from our Walmex operations. Accordingly, diluted net income per common share attributable to Walmart was $0.17 and $3.71 for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, which represents respective increases of $0.83 and $1.74 when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.</p>

The increases were due to comparable sales of 4.9% and 6.1% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, driven by growth in transactions combined with growth in average ticket, including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness. The increases were partially offset by a modest decrease in general merchandise sales. The Walmart U.S. segment's eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.8% and 2.7% to comparable sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, which was primarily driven by store pickup and delivery.</p>

<p>Gross profit rate increased 151 and 44 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year, primarily driven by the shift in timing of the BBD sales event, partially offset by ongoing format and channel mix shifts and category mix shifts to food and consumables.</p>
<p>Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 75 basis points for the three months ended October 31, 2023 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily driven by the shift in timing of the BBD sales event, partially offset by format mix shifts in certain markets. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 53 basis points for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to strong sales, format mix shifts and operating efficiencies in most of our markets, partially offset by the timing of the BBD sales event.</p>

<p>Net sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $0.6 billion or 2.8% and $1.4 billion or 2.2% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 2.9% and 2.4% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively. Growth in comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket, including strong sales in grocery and health and wellness. Comparable sales for the nine months were partially offset by lower fuel sales due to deflation in this category. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.4% and 1.6% to comparable sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, which was primarily driven by Curbside Pickup and Ship to Home.</p>
<p>Gross profit rate increased 16 and 64 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increase in gross profit rate for the three months ended October 31, 2023 was primarily due to a reduction in inflation related LIFO charges, partially offset by product mix shifts into lower margin categories and investments in price. The increase in gross profit rate for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 was primarily due to the lapping of elevated supply chain costs and a reduction in inflation related LIFO charges.</p>
<p>Membership and other income increased 4.5% and 5.4% for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year. The increases were due to growth in the membership base, Plus penetration and Plus renewals.</p>
<p>Operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 13 and 57 basis points for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to elevated technology spend and higher facilities costs. In addition, lower fuel sales contributed to the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales during the nine months ended October 31, 2023.</p>
<p>As a result of the factors discussed above, operating income was relatively flat and increased $0.1 billion for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023, respectively, when compared to the same periods in the previous fiscal year.</p>
<h2>Liquidity and Capital Resources</h2>
<h2>Liquidity</h2>
<p>The strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to fund operations, finance our global investment activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>Net cash provided by operating activities was $19.0 billion as compared to $15.7 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase is primarily due to timing of certain payments and moderated levels of inventory purchases, partially offset by payment of the remaining accrued opioid legal charges.</p>
<h2>Cash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit</h2>
<p>Cash and cash equivalents were $12.2 billion and $11.6 billion at October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our working capital deficit was $15.8 billion as of October 31, 2023, which increased when compared to the $13.7 billion working capital deficit as of October 31, 2022, primarily driven by timing of certain payments and an increase in short-term borrowings, partially offset by a decrease in current maturities of long-term debt. We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of cash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of payments of cash dividends and share repurchases.</p>
<p>As of October 31, 2023 and January 31, 2023, cash and cash equivalents of $3.6 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively, may not be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws or other restrictions or are subject to the approval of the noncontrolling interest shareholders.</p>

<p>Net cash used in financing activities generally consists of transactions related to our short-term and long-term debt, dividends paid and the repurchase of Company stock. Transactions with noncontrolling interest shareholders are also classified as cash flows used in financing activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $0.2 billion as compared to $5.6 billion for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities is primarily due to fewer repurchases of Company stock and an increase in short-term borrowings, partially offset by the purchase of certain noncontrolling interests and payments of long-term debt.</p>
<p>In April 2023, the Company renewed and extended its existing 364-day revolving credit facility of $10.0 billion as well as its five-year credit facility of $5.0 billion. In total, we had committed lines of credit in the U.S. of $15.0 billion at October 31, 2023, all undrawn.</p>

Refer to Note 4 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the issuances and repayments of long-term debt.</p>
<h2>Dividends</h2>
<p>Effective February 21, 2023, the Board of Directors approved the fiscal 2024 annual dividend of $2.28 per share, an increase over the fiscal 2023 annual dividend of $2.24 per share. For fiscal 2024, the annual dividend was or will be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.57 per share, according to the following record and payable dates:</p>

<h2>Company Share Repurchase Program</h2>
<p>From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the nine months ended October 31, 2023 were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in November 2022, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases. As of October 31, 2023, authorization for $18.1 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.</p>
<p>We regularly review share repurchase activity and consider several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings, our results of operations and the market price of our common stock. We anticipate that a majority of the ongoing share repurchase program will be funded through the Company's free cash flow. The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, share repurchase information for the nine months ended October 31, 2023 and 2022:</p>

<h2>Purchase and Sale of Subsidiary Stock</h2>
<p>During the nine months ended October 31, 2023, the Company paid $3.5 billion to acquire shares from certain Flipkart noncontrolling interest holders and settle the liability to former noncontrolling interest holders of PhonePe. Additionally, during the nine months ended October 31, 2023, the Company received $0.7 billion related to new rounds of equity funding for the Company's majority-owned PhonePe subsidiary.</p>
<h2>Material Cash Requirements</h2>
<p>Material cash requirements from operating activities primarily consist of inventory purchases, employee related costs, taxes, interest and other general operating expenses, which we expect to be primarily satisfied by our cash from operations. Other material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations include short-term borrowings, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases and purchase obligations.</p>
<h2>Capital Resources</h2>
<p>We believe our cash flows from operations, current cash position, short-term borrowings and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements and contractual obligations, which includes funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases.</p>
<p>We have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. As of October 31, 2023, the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows:</p>

<p>Credit rating agencies review their ratings periodically and, therefore, the credit ratings assigned to us by each agency may be subject to revision at any time. Accordingly, we are not able to predict whether our current credit ratings will remain consistent over time. Factors that could affect our credit ratings include changes in our operating performance, the general economic environment, conditions in the retail industry, our financial position, including our total debt and capitalization, and changes in our business strategy. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency could increase our future borrowing costs or impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper markets with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, potentially requiring us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. The credit rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our commercial paper or debt securities. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Moreover, each credit rating is specific to the security to which it applies.</p>

The foregoing matters and other matters described elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q represent contingent liabilities of the Company that may or may not result in the incurrence of a material liability by the Company upon their final resolution.</p>
<h2>Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk</h2>
<p>Market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and the fair value of certain equity investments. As of October 31, 2023, there were no material changes to our market risks disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023. The information concerning market risk set forth in Part II, Item 7A. of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, as filed with the SEC on March 17, 2023, under the caption "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk," is hereby incorporated by reference into this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.</p>

<h2>Item 4. Controls and Procedures</h2>
<p>We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is required to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion. In designing and evaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Our management is necessarily required to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures. Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities. Since we do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more limited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.</p>
<p>In the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and processes to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, automating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations and increasing monitoring controls. In the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we began implementing a new financial system, including our general ledger, in stages beginning in our U.S. and Canadian markets. This financial system is a significant component of our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to implement other components of our new financial system in stages, and each implementation will impact our internal control over financial reporting.</p>
<p>An evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms. There has been no significant change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2023, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.</p>

<h2>PART II. OTHER INFORMATION</h2>
<h2>Item 1. Legal Proceedings</h2>
<p>I. SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION: The Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters, including responding to subpoenas and requests for information in connection with government investigations. W e discuss certain legal proceedings in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q under the caption "Item 1. Financial Statements," in Note 6 to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, which is captioned "Contingencies," under the sub-caption "Legal Proceedings." We refer you to that discussion for important information concerning those legal proceedings, including the basis for such actions and, where known, the relief sought. We provide the following additional information concerning those legal proceedings, including the name of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, and the date on which the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed.</p>
<p>Prescription Opiate Litigation: In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the "MDL"). The MDL is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and includes over 400 cases as of November 15, 2023. The liability phase of a single, two-county trial in one of the MDL cases against a number of parties, including the Company, regarding opioid dispensing claims resulted in a jury verdict on November 23, 2021, finding in favor of the plaintiffs as to the liability of all defendants, including the Company. The abatement phase of the single, two-county trial resulted in a judgment on August 17, 2022, that ordered all three defendants, including the Company, to pay an aggregate amount of approximately $0.7 billion over fifteen years, on a joint and several liability basis, and granted the plaintiffs injunctive relief. The Company has filed an appeal with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The monetary aspect of the judgment is stayed pending appeal, and the injunctive portion of the judgment went into effect on February 20, 2023. On September 11, 2023, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order certifying certain questions in the appeal for review by the Supreme Court of Ohio. The MDL designated five additional single-county cases as bellwethers to proceed through discovery, though those bellwether plaintiffs have elected to participate in the Settlement Framework. On October 25, 2023, the MDL designated four cases brought by third-party payers as bellwether cases to proceed through discovery. Additional bellwethers of cases brought by hospitals and other healthcare providers may be designated in the future. In addition, there are over 100 other cases pending in state and federal courts throughout the country against the Company as of November 15, 2023, as well as other cases in Canada against Wal-Mart Canada Corp. and certain other subsidiaries of the Company. The case citations and currently scheduled trial dates, where applicable, are listed on Exhibit 99.1 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.</p>
<p>Opioid Settlement Framework: On November 15, 2022, the Company announced that it had agreed to a Settlement Framework to resolve substantially all opioidsrelated lawsuits filed against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes (other than the single, two-county trial on appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals as described above), as described in more detail in Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company now has settlement agreements with all 50 states, including four states that previously settled with the Company, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and three other U.S. territories, that are intended to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits brought by state and local governments against the Company. As described in more detail in Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Settlement Framework became effective on September 6, 2023.</p>
<p>DOJ Opioid Civil Litigation: A civil complaint pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware has been filed by the U.S. Department of Justice (the "DOJ") against the Company, in which the DOJ alleges violations of the Controlled Substances Act related to nationwide distribution and dispensing of opioids. U.S. v. Walmart Inc., et al ., USDC, Dist. of DE, 12/22/20. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. After the parties had fully briefed the Company's motion to dismiss, the DOJ filed an amended complaint on October 7, 2022. On November 7, 2022, the Company filed a partial motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The motion remains pending.</p>
<p>Opioids Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation: Three derivative complaints and two securities class actions drawing heavily on the allegations of the DOJ complaint have been filed in Delaware naming the Company and various current and former directors and certain current and former officers as defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in which the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in connection with oversight of opioids dispensing and distribution and that the defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and are liable for contribution under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act in connection with the Company's disclosures about opioids. Two of the derivative suits have been filed in the U.S. District Court in Delaware and those suits have been stayed pending further developments in other opioids litigation matters. The other derivative suit has been filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The defendants in the derivative suit pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery moved to dismiss and/or to stay that case on December 21, 2021; the plaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. On April 20, 2022, the defendants moved to dismiss and/or stay proceedings on the amended complaint. In two orders issued on April 12 and 26, 2023, the Court of Chancery granted the defendants' motion to dismiss with respect to claims involving the Company' s distribution practices and denied the remainder of the motion, including the Company's request to stay the litigation. On May 5, 2023, the Company's Board of Directors appointed an independent Special Litigation Committee (the "SLC") to investigate the allegations regarding certain current and former officers and directors named in the various proceedings regarding oversight with respect to opioids. The Board has authorized</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<h2>Table of Contents</h2>
<p>the SLC to retain independent legal counsel and such other advisors as the SLC deems appropriate in carrying out its duties. The derivative matter pending in the Delaware Court of Chancery is stayed until the SLC completes its investigation.</p>
<p>The securities class actions, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act regarding the Company's disclosures with respect to opioids, purport to be filed on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016, through December 22, 2020. On May 11, 2021, the U.S. District Court in Delaware consolidated the class actions and appointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel. The defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated securities class action on October 8, 2021. On October 14, 2022, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which revised the applicable putative class of investors to those who acquired Walmart stock from March 31, 2017, through December 22, 2020. On November 16, 2022, the Company moved to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending.</p>

<h2>II. CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS</h2>
<p>Foreign Direct Investment Matters: In July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a show cause notice to Flipkart Private Limited and one of its subsidiaries ("Flipkart"), and to unrelated companies and individuals, including certain current and former shareholders and directors of Flipkart. The notice requests the recipients to show cause as to why further proceedings under India's Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations (the "Rules") should not be initiated against them based on alleged violations during the period from 2009 to 2015, prior to the Company's acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart in 2018. The notice is an initial stage of proceedings under the Rules which could, depending upon the conclusions at the end of the initial stage, lead to a hearing to consider the merits of the allegations described in the notice. If a hearing is initiated and if it is determined that violations of the Rules occurred, the regulatory authority has the authority to impose monetary and/or non-monetary relief. Flipkart has begun the process of responding to the notice and, if the matter progresses to a consideration of the merits of the allegations described in the notice is initiated, Flipkart intends to defend against the allegations vigorously. Due to the fact that this process is in an early stage, the Company is unable to predict whether the notice will lead to a hearing on the merits or, if it does, the final outcome of the resulting proceedings. While the Company does not currently believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result from the notice, the amount of the proceeds the Company may receive in indemnification from individuals and entities that sold shares to the Company under the 2018 agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired its majority stake in Flipkart, and can provide no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse effect to its business or its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements .</p>
<p>III. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS : Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed an applied threshold of $1 million.</p>
<p>In December 2021, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of California filed suit against the Company, bringing enforcement claims regarding Walmart's management of waste consumer products at its California facilities that are alleged to be hazardous. The suit was filed in Superior Court of Alameda County, California, Case No. 21CV004367, People v. Walmart Inc., and a trial date has been scheduled for April 22, 2024. The Company believes it has strong defenses and is vigorously defending this litigation matter. While the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, the potential for penalties or settlement costs could exceed $1 million. Although the Company does not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of this matter and no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse effect to its business or its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.</p>
<p>In October 2023, the Company received a Finding of Violation from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") alleging violations of the Clean Air Act in connection with the Company's refrigeration leak detection and repair program at certain of its facilities. The Company is evaluating the findings and cooperating with the EPA in its investigation. The EPA may seek to impose monetary and non-monetary penalties for the alleged violations of the Clean Air Act. Due to the fact that this process is in an early stage, the Company is unable to predict the final outcome of this matter. Although the Company does not believe this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of this matter and no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse effect to its business or its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.</p>
<h2>Item 1A. Risk Factors</h2>
<p>In addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A, under the caption "Risk Factors," of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, which risks could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. No material change in the risk factors discussed in such Form 10-K has occurred. Such risk factors do not identify all risks that we face because our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally.</p>
<h2>Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds</h2>
<p>From time to time, the Company repurchases shares of our common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the Company's Board of Directors. All repurchases made during the three months ended October 31, 2023 were made under the current $20 billion share repurchase program approved in November 2022, which has no expiration date or other restrictions limiting the period over which the Company can make repurchases. As of October 31, 2023, authorization for $18.1 billion of share repurchases remained under the share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares are constructively retired and returned to an unissued status.</p>
<p>The Company regularly reviews its share repurchase activity and considers several factors in determining when to execute share repurchases, including, among other things, current cash needs, capacity for leverage, cost of borrowings and the market price of its common stock. Share repurchase activity under our share repurchase program, on a trade date basis, for the three months ended October 31, 2023, was as follows:</p>
