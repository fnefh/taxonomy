<h2>FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<h2>NOTE 1. PRESENTATION</h2>
<p>For purposes of this report, "Ford," the "Company," "we," "our," "us," or similar references mean Ford Motor Company, our consolidated subsidiaries, and our consolidated VIEs of which we are the primary beneficiary, unless the context requires otherwise. We also make reference to Ford Motor Credit Company LLC, herein referenced to as Ford Credit. Our consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for interim financial information, instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.</p>
<p>In the opinion of management, these unaudited financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair statement of our results of operations and financial condition for the periods, and at the dates, presented. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the full year. Reference should be made to the financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 ("2023 Form 10-K Report").</p>
<h2>NOTE 2. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS</h2>
<h2>Adoption of New Accounting Standards</h2>
<p>We adopted the following Accounting Standards Updates ("ASUs") during 2024, none of which had a material impact to our consolidated financial statements or financial statement disclosures:</p>
<p>| ASU | | Effective Date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2023-01 | Leases: Common Control Arrangements | January 1, 2024 |
| 2023-02 | Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures - Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method | January 1, 2024 |</p>
<h2>Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Adopted</h2>
<p>ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued a new accounting standard which requires disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") for each reportable segment. In addition to significant segment expenses that are separately disclosed, the standard requires disclosure of an amount for "other segment items" by reportable segment and a description of its composition. The standard also requires all annual disclosures about a reporting segment's profit or loss and assets to be provided on an interim basis. This new standard is effective for our 2024 annual financial statements and interim periods beginning in 2025. We are assessing the effect on our consolidated financial statement disclosures; however, adoption will not impact our consolidated balance sheets or income statements.</p>
<p>ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. In December 2023, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with retrospective application permitted. There will be no impact to our consolidated balance sheets or income statements; however, there will be changes to our consolidated financial statement disclosures, primarily related to the effective tax rate reconciliation and cash paid for income taxes.</p>
<p>All other ASUs issued but not yet adopted were assessed and determined to be not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or financial statement disclosures.</p>

<p>The following tables disaggregate our revenue by major source for the periods ended March 31 (in millions):</p>

| Total revenues | $ 39,890 | $ 2,887 | $ 42,777 |</p>
<p>__________</p>
<p>The amount of consideration we receive and revenue we recognize on our vehicles, parts, and accessories varies with changes in return rights, marketing incentives we offer to our customers and their customers, and other pricing adjustments. Estimates of marketing incentives and other pricing adjustments are based on our expectations of retail and fleet sales volumes, mix of products to be sold, competitor actions, and incentive programs to be offered. Customer acceptance of products and programs, as well as other market conditions, will impact these estimates. As a result of changes in our estimate of variable consideration (e.g., marketing incentives), we recorded a decrease related to revenue recognized in prior periods of $178 million and $707 million in the first quarter of 2023 and 2024, respectively.</p>
<p>We had a balance of $4.8 billion and $4.9 billion of unearned revenue associated primarily with outstanding extended service contracts reported in Other liabilities and deferred revenue at December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively . We expect to recognize approximately $1.2 billion of the unearned amount in the remainder of 2024, $1.3 billion in 2025, and $2.4 billion thereafter. We recognized $380 million and $431 million of unearned amounts from prior years as revenue during the first quarter of 2023 and 2024, respectively.</p>
<p>Amounts paid to dealers to obtain extended service contracts are deferred and recorded as Other assets . We had a balance of $317 million and $321 million in deferred costs as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively. We recognized $26 million of amortization during both the first quarter of 2023 and 2024.</p>

<p>Non-Consumer Portfolio. The credit quality of dealer financing receivables is evaluated based on Ford Credit's internal dealer risk rating analysis. Ford Credit uses a proprietary model to assign each dealer a risk rating. This model uses historical dealer performance data to identify key factors about a dealer that are considered most significant in predicting a dealer's ability to meet its financial obligations. Ford Credit also considers numerous other financial and qualitative factors of the dealer's operations, including capitalization and leverage, liquidity and cash flow, profitability, and credit history with Ford Credit and other creditors.</p>
<p>Dealers are assigned to one of four groups according to risk ratings as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Group I - strong to superior financial metrics;</li>
<li>· Group II - fair to favorable financial metrics;</li>
<li>· Group III - marginal to weak financial metrics; and</li>
<li>· Group IV - poor financial metrics, including dealers classified as uncollectible.</li>

<p>__________</p>
<p>Non-Accrual of Revenue. The accrual of financing revenue is discontinued at the time a receivable is determined to be uncollectible or when it is 90 days past due. Accounts may be restored to accrual status only when a customer settles all past-due deficiency balances and future payments are reasonably assured. For receivables in non-accrual status, subsequent financing revenue is recognized only to the extent a payment is received. Payments are generally applied first to outstanding interest and then to the unpaid principal balance.</p>
<p>Loan Modifications. Consumer and non-consumer receivables that have a modified interest rate and/or a term extension (including receivables that were modified in reorganization proceedings pursuant to the U.S. Bankruptcy Code) are typically considered to be loan modifications. Ford Credit does not grant modifications to the principal balance of the receivables. If a receivable is modified in a reorganization proceeding, all payment requirements of the reorganization plan need to be met before remaining balances are forgiven.</p>
<p>The use of interest rate modifications and term extensions helps Ford Credit mitigate financial loss. Term extensions may assist in cases where Ford Credit believes the customer will recover from short-term financial difficulty and resume regularly scheduled payments. The effect of most loan modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is included in the historical trends used to measure the allowance for credit losses. A loan modification that improves the delinquency status of a borrower reduces the probability of default, which results in a lower allowance for credit losses. At March 31, 2024, an insignificant portion of Ford Credit's total finance receivables portfolio had been granted a loan modification, and these modifications are generally treated as a continuation of the existing loan.</p>

<h2>NOTE 8. FORD CREDIT FINANCE RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES (Continued)</h2>
<h2>Allowance for Credit Losses</h2>
<p>The allowance for credit losses represents an estimate of the lifetime expected credit losses inherent in finance receivables as of the balance sheet date. The adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is assessed quarterly.</p>
<p>Adjustments to the allowance for credit losses are made by recording charges to Ford Credit interest, operating, and other expenses on our consolidated income statements. The uncollectible portion of a finance receivable is charged to the allowance for credit losses at the earlier of when an account is deemed to be uncollectible or when an account is 120 days delinquent, taking into consideration the financial condition of the customer or borrower, the value of the collateral, recourse to guarantors, and other factors .</p>
<p>Charge-offs on finance receivables include uncollected amounts related to principal, interest, late fees, and other allowable charges. Recoveries on finance receivables previously charged off as uncollectible are credited to the allowance for credit losses. In the event Ford Credit repossesses the collateral, the receivable is charged off and the collateral is recorded at its estimated fair value less costs to sell and reported in Other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.</p>
<p>An analysis of the allowance for credit losses related to finance receivables for the periods ended March 31 was as follows (in millions):</p>
<p>| | First Quarter 2023 | First Quarter 2023 | First Quarter 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Provision for credit losses | 91 | (3) | 88 |
| Other (a) | (3) | - | (3) |
| Ending balance | $ 877 | $ 3 | $ 880 |</p>
<p>__________</p>
<p>During the first quarter of 2024, the allowance for credit losses decreased $ 2 million, driven by the impact of improvement in the U.S. macroeconomic outlook assumptions, offset partially by an increase in Ford Credit finance receivables. Net charge-offs increased from a year ago, reflecting continuing normalization from lower levels following the COVID-19 pandemic. While credit performance has remained strong, high inflationary pressure and high interest rates have caused economic uncertainty, which is expected to have an unfavorable impact on future consumer credit losses. Ford Credit will continue to monitor economic trends and conditions and portfolio performance and will adjust the reserve accordingly.</p>

<h2>NOTE 14. EMPLOYEE SEPARATION ACTIONS AND EXIT AND DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES</h2>
<p>We generally record costs associated with voluntary separations at the time of employee acceptance. We record costs associated with involuntary separation programs when management has approved the plan for separation, the affected employees are identified, and it is unlikely that actions required to complete the separation plan will change significantly. Costs associated with benefits that are contingent on the employee continuing to provide service are accrued over the required service period.</p>
<h2>Company Excluding Ford Credit</h2>
<p>Employee separation actions and exit and disposal activities include employee separation costs, facility and other asset-related charges (e.g., impairment, accelerated depreciation), dealer and supplier payments, other statutory and contractual obligations, and other expenses, which are recorded in Cost of sales and Selling, administrative, and other expenses . Below are actions that have been initiated:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Brazil. Exited manufacturing operations in 2021 resulting in the closure of facilities in Camaçari, Taubaté, and Troller. Sales of the Taubaté and Camaçari plants were completed in 2023</li>
<li>· India. Ceased vehicle manufacturing in Sanand in the fourth quarter of 2021 and ceased manufacturing in Chennai in the third quarter of 2022. A sale of the Sanand vehicle assembly and powertrain plants was completed in the first quarter of 2023 (see Note 15)</li>
<li>· Spain. Ceased production of the Mondeo at the Valencia plant in the first quarter of 2022</li>
<li>· China. Ceased development of certain product programs</li>
<li>· Germany. Production of the Focus will cease at our Saarlouis Body and Assembly Plant in 2025. Our plan is to repurpose the facility into a technology center, retaining 1,000 positions.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, we are continuing to reduce our global workforce and take other restructuring actions, including voluntary separation packages offered to our hourly workforce in the first quarter of 2024 as agreed to in our collective bargaining agreements in North America, and the separation of salaried workers, primarily in Europe, as announced in the first quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes the activities for the periods ended March 31, which are recorded in Other liabilities and deferred revenue (in millions):</p>

<p>We recorded costs of $681 million and $608 million in the first quarter of 2023 and 2024, respectively, related to the actions above. We estimate that we will incur about $1 billion in total charges in 2024 related to such actions, primarily attributable to employee separations and supplier settlements; some charges are related to plans that are subject to negotiations with a works council, union, or other social partner. In addition, we continue to review our global businesses and may take additional restructuring actions where a path to sustained profitability is not feasible when considering the capital allocation required for those businesses.</p>
<h2>NOTE 15. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES</h2>
<h2>Company Excluding Ford Credit</h2>
<p>Ford Sales and Service Korea Company ("FSSK"). In the first quarter of 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell 100% of our equity interest in FSSK. Accordingly, as of March 31, 2024, we reported $72 million of held-for-sale assets, including $ 51 million of cash, and $ 49 million of held-for-sale liabilities in Other assets and Other liabilities, respectively. We determined the assets held for sale were not impaired.</p>
<p>Auto Motive Power ("AMP"). On November 1, 2023, we acquired AMP, a California-based energy management startup focused on electric vehicle charging solutions. Assets acquired primarily include goodwill and technology, which are reported in Other assets. The acquisition did not have a material impact on our financial statements.</p>
<p>Sanand, India ("Sanand") Plants. On January 10, 2023, we completed the sale of our Sanand vehicle assembly and powertrain plants to Tata Passenger Electric Mobility Limited, a subsidiary of Tata Motors Limited. Ford continues to operate the powertrain facility by leasing back the associated land and building. As a result of the sale transaction, we derecognized the fixed assets and recognized the powertrain facility operating lease right-of-use asset and related lease liability in the first quarter of 2023. The fair value of the cash consideration received approximated the carrying value of the fixed assets at the time of sale.</p>

<h2>NOTE 17. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES</h2>
<p>Certain of our affiliates are variable interest entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary. Our maximum exposure to any potential losses associated with these unconsolidated affiliates is limited to our equity investments, accounts receivable, loans, and guarantees and was $3.7 billion and $4.6 billion at December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively. Of these amounts, guarantees of $125 million at both December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024 related to certain obligations of our VIEs also are included in Note 18.</p>
<p>On July 13, 2022, Ford, SK On Co., Ltd., and SK Battery America, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of SK On) completed the creation of BlueOval SK, LLC ("BOSK"), a 50/50 joint venture that will build and operate electric vehicle battery plants in Tennessee and Kentucky to supply batteries to Ford and Ford affiliates. BOSK is a variable interest entity of which we are not the primary beneficiary, and we use the equity method of accounting for our investment. As of March 31, 2024, Ford has contributed to BOSK $3.9 billion of its agreed capital contribution of up to $ 6.6 billion through 2026. The total amount of capital contributions is subject to adjustments agreed to by the parties.</p>
<h2>FORD MOTOR COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<h2>NOTE 18. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES</h2>
<p>Commitments and contingencies primarily consist of guarantees and indemnifications, litigation and claims, and warranty and field service actions.</p>
<h2>Guarantees and Indemnifications</h2>
<p>Financial Guarantees. Financial guarantees and indemnifications are recorded at fair value at their inception. Subsequent to initial recognition, the guarantee liability is adjusted at each reporting period to reflect the current estimate of expected payments resulting from possible default events over the remaining life of the guarantee. The maximum potential payments for financial guarantees were $ 535 million and $515 million at December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively. The carrying value of recorded liabilities related to financial guarantees was $59 million and $43 million at December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively.</p>
<p>Our financial guarantees consist of debt and lease obligations of certain joint ventures, as well as certain financial obligations of outside third parties, including suppliers, to support our business and economic growth. Expiration dates vary through 2037, and guarantees will terminate on payment and/or cancellation of the underlying obligation. A payment by us would be triggered by failure of the joint venture or other third party to fulfill its obligation covered by the guarantee. In some circumstances, we are entitled to recover from a third party amounts paid by us under the guarantee.</p>
<p>Non-Financial Guarantees . Non-financial guarantees and indemnifications are recorded at fair value at their inception. We regularly review our performance risk under these arrangements, and in the event it becomes probable we will be required to perform under a guarantee or indemnity, the amount of probable payment is recorded. The maximum potential payments and carrying values of recorded liabilities related to non-financial guarantees were de minimis at both December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024.</p>
<p>In the ordinary course of business, we execute contracts involving indemnifications standard in the industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction, such as the sale of a business. These indemnifications might include and are not limited to claims relating to any of the following: environmental, tax, and shareholder matters; intellectual property rights; power generation contracts; governmental regulations and employment-related matters; dealer, supplier, and other commercial contractual relationships; and financial matters, such as securitizations. Performance under these indemnities generally would be triggered by a breach of contract claim brought by a counterparty, including a joint venture or alliance partner, or a thirdparty claim. While some of these indemnifications are limited in nature, many of them do not limit potential payment. Therefore, we are unable to estimate a maximum amount of future payments that could result from claims made under these unlimited indemnities.</p>

<h2>NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<h2>NOTE 18. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)</h2>
<h2>Litigation and Claims</h2>
<p>Various legal actions, proceedings, and claims (generally, "matters") are pending or may be instituted or asserted against us. These include, but are not limited to, matters arising out of alleged defects in our products; product warranties; governmental regulations relating to safety, emissions, and fuel economy or other matters; government incentives; tax matters, including trade and customs; alleged illegal acts resulting in fines or penalties; financial services; employment-related matters; dealer, supplier, and other contractual relationships; intellectual property rights; environmental matters; shareholder or investor matters; and financial reporting matters. Certain of the pending legal actions are, or purport to be, class actions. Some of the matters involve or may involve claims for compensatory, punitive, or antitrust or other treble damages in very large amounts, or demands for field service actions, environmental remediation programs, sanctions, loss of government incentives, assessments, or other relief, which, if granted, would require very large expenditures.</p>
<p>The extent of our financial exposure to these matters is difficult to estimate. Many matters do not specify a dollar amount for damages, and many others specify only a jurisdictional minimum. To the extent an amount is asserted, our historical experience suggests that in most instances the amount asserted is not a reliable indicator of the ultimate outcome.</p>
<p>We accrue for matters when losses are deemed probable and reasonably estimable. In evaluating matters for accrual and disclosure purposes, we take into consideration factors such as our historical experience with matters of a similar nature, the specific facts and circumstances asserted, the likelihood that we will prevail, and the severity of any potential loss. We reevaluate and update our accruals as matters progress over time.</p>
<p>For the majority of matters, which generally arise out of alleged defects in our products, we establish an accrual based on our extensive historical experience with similar matters. We do not believe there is a reasonably possible outcome materially in excess of our accrual for these matters.</p>
<p>For the remaining matters, where our historical experience with similar matters is of more limited value (i.e., "non-pattern matters"), we evaluate the matters primarily based on the individual facts and circumstances. For non-pattern matters, we evaluate whether there is a reasonable possibility of a material loss in excess of any accrual that can be estimated. Our estimate of reasonably possible loss in excess of our accruals for all material matters currently reflects indirect tax matters, for which we estimate the aggregate risk to be a range of up to about $0.2 billion, a decrease of about $1.2 billion from December 31, 2023, primarily reflecting a customs matter settlement.</p>
<p>As noted, the litigation process is subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of individual matters is not predictable with assurance. Our assessments are based on our knowledge and experience, but the ultimate outcome of any matter could require payment substantially in excess of the amount that we have accrued and/or disclosed.</p>

<h2>Warranty and Field Service Actions</h2>
<p>We accrue the estimated cost of both base warranty coverages and field service actions at the time of sale. We establish our estimate of base warranty obligations using a patterned estimation model, using historical information regarding the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims for each vehicle line by model year. We establish our estimates of field service action obligations using a patterned estimation model, using historical information regarding the nature, frequency, severity, and average cost of claims for each model year. In addition, from time to time, we issue extended warranties at our expense, the estimated cost of which is accrued at the time of issuance. Warranty and field service action obligations are reported in Other liabilities and deferred revenue . We reevaluate the adequacy of our accruals on a regular basis.</p>
<p>We recognize the benefit from a recovery of the costs associated with our warranty and field service actions when specifics of the recovery have been agreed with our supplier and the amount of recovery is virtually certain. Recoveries are reported in Trade and other receivables, net and Other assets.</p>
<p>The estimate of our future warranty and field service action costs, net of estimated supplier recoveries, for the periods ended March 31 was as follows (in millions):</p>
<p>| | First Quarter | First Quarter |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | 2023 | 2024 |
| Beginning balance | $ 9,193 | $ 11,504 |
| Payments made during the period | (990) | (1,391) |

| Foreign currency translation and other | (117) | (61) |
| Ending balance | $ 9,284 | $ 11,540 |</p>
<p>Changes to our estimated costs are reported as changes in accrual related to pre-existing warranties in the table above. Our estimate of reasonably possible costs in excess of our accruals for material field service actions and customer satisfaction actions is a range of up to about $1.3 billion in the aggregate.</p>

<h2>NOTE 19. SEGMENT INFORMATION (Continued)</h2>
<h2>Segment Revenue, Cost, and Asset Principles for Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro</h2>
<p>External vehicle and digital services revenue is generally vehicle-specific and included in the segment responsible for the external vehicle sale. A majority of parts and accessories revenue and cost is attributed to customer sales channels or vehicle lines based on recent end customer sales and is included in the respective segment.</p>
<p>In the normal course of business, Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro transact between segments and cooperate to leverage synergies, including developing and manufacturing vehicles on behalf of another segment. When one segment produces a vehicle that is sold externally by another segment, an intersegment transaction occurs. The producing segment will report intersegment revenue to recoup the costs associated with the unit produced. This includes material cost, labor and overhead (including depreciation and amortization), inbound freight, and an intersegment markup. The intersegment markup amount is set to deliver a competitive return to the producing segment for its manufacturing and distribution service. Costs are reflected in the associated segment externally reporting the vehicle sale, as detailed in the table below:</p>
<p>| Income Statement Elements | Examples | Segment Reporting |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Costs specific to a particular vehicle | Bill of material cost and initial warranty accrual | Reported in the segment externally selling the vehicle |
| Costs identifiable by product line | Manufacturing and logistics costs, depreciation &amp; amortization expense, direct research &amp; development costs | Typically identifiable to the product line or production location. Reported in the segment externally selling the vehicle, based on relative volume |
| Shared costs | Selling, general &amp; administrative expense, and indirect/cross product line research &amp; development costs | Typically shared across all segments, generally based on relative volume. Certain costs clearly linked to a segment are reported in the specific segment |
| Intersegment markup costs for intersegment vehicle transactions | Contract manufacturing and distribution fees | Reported in the segment externally selling the vehicle, for each applicable vehicle transaction |</p>
<p>Assets are reported in each segment, aligned to the appropriate operational responsibility. Manufacturing assets, e.g., our plants and the machinery and equipment therein, are included in our Ford Blue and Ford Model e segments. Manufacturing assets producing only, or primarily, EVs and related components are reflected in Ford Model e. Manufacturing assets that support the production of ICE and hybrid vehicles, including those producing ICE and electric in the same facility, are included in Ford Blue. Vendor tooling dedicated to producing EV parts is reported in Ford Model e. There are no Ford manufacturing or vendor tooling assets reported in Ford Pro. Regardless of the segment reporting the asset, depreciation and amortization expense is reflected on the basis of production volume and reported in the segment that reports the external vehicle sale.</p>
<p>Equity in net income/(loss) of affiliated companies is included in Income/(Loss) before income taxes , based primarily on which segment the entity supports or has the majority of the entity's purchases or sales. The table below shows the segment reporting for our most significant unconsolidated entities:</p>
<p>| Ford Blue | Ford Model e | Ford Pro |

<h2>ITEM 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.</h2>
<h2>RECENT DEVELOPMENTS</h2>
<h2>Electric Vehicle Market</h2>
<p>Although we continue to invest in our electric vehicle strategy, we have observed lower-than-anticipated industrywide electric vehicle adoption rates and near-term pricing pressures, which has led us, and may in the future lead us, to adjust our spending, production, and/or product launches to better match the pace of electric vehicle adoption. As a result, we have incurred, and may continue to incur, expenses related to payments to our electric vehicle-related suppliers (battery, raw material, or otherwise), inventory adjustments, or other matters. Further, significant unexpected changes in the EV demand environment have led, and may in the future lead, to incremental competitive pricing actions. These market dynamics may continue to occur, which could have a substantial impact on our business.</p>
<p>As a result, in the first quarter of 2024, we recorded about $0.4 billion of expenses and about $0.3 billion of adjustments related to revenue recognized in prior periods. In addition, slower-than-anticipated development of the electric vehicle market may impact our strategy to comply with regulatory standards, and, in some cases, we plan to utilize credits purchased from third parties to demonstrate regulatory compliance or we may need to modify our product offerings. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K Report and as updated by our subsequent filings with the SEC for a discussion of the risks related to lower-than-anticipated electric vehicle volumes and our planned transition to a greater mix of electric vehicles.</p>

<h2>RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</h2>
<p>In the first quarter of 2024, the net income attributable to Ford Motor Company was $1,332 million, and Company adjusted EBIT was $2,763 million.</p>
<p>Net income/(loss) includes certain items ("special items") that are excluded from Company adjusted EBIT. These items are discussed in more detail in Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements. We report special items separately to allow investors analyzing our results to identify certain infrequent significant items that they may wish to exclude when considering the trend of ongoing operating results. Our pre-tax and tax special items were as follows (in millions):</p>

| Total EBIT Special Items | $ (912) | $ (873) |
| Provision for/(Benefit from) tax special items (a) | $ (144) | $ (220) |</p>
<p>__________</p>
<p>We recorded $873 million of pre-tax special item charges in the first quarter of 2024, driven primarily by restructuring actions in Europe, the extended duration of the EV program changeover at Oakville, and buyouts for hourly employees in North America.</p>
<p>In Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, special items are reflected as a separate reconciling item, as opposed to being allocated among our segments. This reflects the fact that management excludes these items from its review of operating segment results for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources.</p>

<p>__________</p>
<p>The year-over-year decrease of $425 million in net income and $616 million in Company adjusted EBIT in the first quarter of 2024 was driven by lower Ford Blue and Model e EBIT, offset partially by higher Ford Pro EBIT.</p>

| First Quarter 2024 EBIT | $ 905 |</p>
<p>In the first quarter of 2024, Ford Blue's wholesales decreased 11% from a year ago, driven primarily by lower F-150 volume due to the new model launch in the quarter and ceasing production of the Fiesta in Europe. First quarter 2024 revenue decreased 13%, driven by lower wholesales and unfavorable mix, offset partially by higher currency-related pricing in South America.</p>
<p>Ford Blue's first quarter 2024 EBIT was $905 million, a decrease of $1.7 billion from a year ago, with an EBIT margin of 4.2%. The lower EBIT was driven by lower wholesales and unfavorable mix (primarily fewer F-150s due to the new model launch). Higher costs reflected primarily material cost for new products and higher warranty costs, offset partially by lower structural costs.</p>

<p>In the first quarter of 2024, Ford Model e's wholesales decreased 20% from a year ago to 10,000 units. First quarter 2024 revenue decreased 84%, primarily driven by the accrual impacts for units in dealer stock at December 31, 2023 (about $0.3 billion) as well as lower net pricing.</p>
<p>Ford Model e's first quarter 2024 EBIT loss was $1.3 billion, a $598 million higher loss than a year ago. The lower EBIT was primarily driven by lower net pricing and exchange. Favorable cost performance included lower battery raw materials and engineering expense, offset partially by volume-related obligations of about $90 million for batteries and certain other commodities and higher manufacturing costs ahead of the upcoming Explorer EV launch in Europe.</p>

<p>In the first quarter of 2024, Ford Pro's wholesales increased 21% from a year ago, driven by a full quarter of the all new Super Duty truck, which launched in the first quarter of 2023, and higher sales of the Transit range of vans. First quarter 2024 revenue increased 36%, driven by higher wholesales, favorable mix, and higher net pricing.</p>
<p>Ford Pro's first quarter 2024 EBIT was $3.0 billion, an increase of $1.6 billion from a year ago, with an EBIT margin of 16.7%. The improvement in EBIT was driven by higher volume, favorable mix, and higher net pricing. Higher cost was a partial offset, including material costs (primarily new productrelated and inflationary increases), higher growth-related structural costs (including engineering and manufacturing), and higher warranty costs.</p>
<p>Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)</p>
<p>Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro Causal Factors</p>
<p>In general, we measure year-over-year change in Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro segment EBIT using the causal factors listed below, with net pricing and cost variances calculated at present-period volume and mix and exchange:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Market Factors (exclude the impact of unconsolidated affiliate wholesale units):</li>
<li>· Volume and Mix - primarily measures EBIT variance from changes in wholesale unit volumes (at prior-year average contribution margin per unit) driven by changes in industry volume, market share, and dealer stocks, as well as the EBIT variance resulting from changes in product mix, including mix among vehicle lines and mix of trim levels and options within a vehicle line</li>
<li>· Net Pricing - primarily measures EBIT variance driven by changes in wholesale unit prices to dealers and marketing incentive programs such as rebate programs, low-rate financing offers, special lease offers, and stock adjustments on dealer inventory</li>
</ul>

<li>· Contribution Costs - primarily measures EBIT variance driven by per-unit changes in cost categories that typically vary with volume, such as material costs (including commodity and component costs), warranty expense, and freight and duty costs</li>
<li>· Structural Costs - primarily measures EBIT variance driven by absolute change in cost categories that typically do not have a directly proportionate relationship to production volume. Structural costs include the following cost categories:</li>
<li>▪ Manufacturing, Including Volume-Related - consists primarily of costs for hourly and salaried manufacturing personnel, plant overhead (such as utilities and taxes), and new product launch expense. These costs could be affected by volume for operating pattern actions such as overtime, line-speed, and shift schedules</li>
<li>▪ Engineering and Connectivity - consists primarily of costs for vehicle and software engineering personnel, prototype materials, testing, and outside engineering and software services</li>
<li>▪ Spending-Related - consists primarily of depreciation and amortization of our manufacturing and engineering assets, but also includes asset retirements and operating leases</li>
<li>▪ Advertising and Sales Promotions - includes costs for advertising, marketing programs, brand promotions, customer mailings and promotional events, and auto shows</li>
<li>▪ Administrative, Information Technology, and Selling - includes primarily costs for salaried personnel and purchased services related to our staff activities, information technology, and selling functions</li>
<li>· Exchange - primarily measures EBIT variance driven by one or more of the following: (i) transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the relevant entities, (ii) effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars, (iii) effects of remeasuring monetary assets and liabilities of the relevant entities in currencies other than their functional currency, or (iv) results of our foreign currency hedging</li>
<li>· Other - includes a variety of items, such as parts and services earnings, royalties, government incentives, and compensation-related changes</li>

<p>Ford Credit's total net receivables of $136 billion were 10% higher than a year ago, reflecting the impact of increased consumer and non-consumer financing, offset partially by a smaller lease portfolio. The first quarter 2024 U.S. loss-to-receivables ("LTR") ratio of 47 basis points increased from a year ago, but remained low by historical standards. U.S. auction values in the first quarter of 2024 were lower compared to a year ago.</p>
<p>Ford Credit's first quarter 2024 EBT of $326 million was $23 million higher than a year ago, explained primarily by higher financing margin and favorable volume and mix, offset partially by unfavorable lease residual performance.</p>

<h2>Definitions and Information Regarding Ford Credit Causal Factors</h2>
<p>In general, we measure year-over-year changes in Ford Credit's EBT using the causal factors listed below:</p>
<h2>· Volume and Mix:</h2>
<ul>
<li>· Volume primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by changes in average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period financing margin yield (defined below in financing margin) at prior period exchange rates. Volume changes are primarily driven by the volume of new and used vehicles sold and leased, the extent to which Ford Credit purchases retail financing and operating lease contracts, the extent to which Ford Credit provides wholesale financing, the sales price of the vehicles financed, the level of dealer inventories, Ford-sponsored special financing programs available exclusively through Ford Credit, and the availability of cost-effective funding</li>
<li>· Mix primarily measures changes in net financing margin driven by period-over-period changes in the composition of Ford Credit's average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses by product within each region</li>
</ul>
<h2>· Financing Margin:</h2>
<ul>
<li>· Financing margin variance is the period-over-period change in financing margin yield multiplied by the present period average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. This calculation is performed at the product and country level and then aggregated. Financing margin yield equals revenue, less interest expense and scheduled depreciation for the period, divided by average net receivables excluding the allowance for credit losses for the same period</li>
<li>· Financing margin changes are driven by changes in revenue and interest expense. Changes in revenue are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, cost assumptions in pricing, mix of business, and competitive environment. Changes in interest expense are primarily driven by the level of market interest rates, borrowing spreads, and asset-liability management</li>
</ul>
<h2>· Credit Loss:</h2>
<ul>
<li>· Credit loss is the change in the provision for credit losses at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes, management splits the provision for credit losses into net charge-offs and the change in the allowance for credit losses</li>
<li>· Net charge-off changes are primarily driven by the number of repossessions, severity per repossession, and recoveries. Changes in the allowance for credit losses are primarily driven by changes in historical trends in credit losses and recoveries, changes in the composition and size of Ford Credit's present portfolio, changes in trends in historical used vehicle values, and changes in forward looking macroeconomic conditions. For additional information, refer to the "Critical Accounting Estimates - Allowance for Credit Losses" section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2023 Form 10-K Report</li>
</ul>
<h2>· Lease Residual:</h2>
<ul>
<li>· Lease residual measures changes to residual performance at prior period exchange rates. For analysis purposes, management splits residual performance primarily into residual gains and losses, and the change in accumulated supplemental depreciation</li>
<li>· Residual gain and loss changes are primarily driven by the number of vehicles returned to Ford Credit and sold, and the difference between the auction value and the depreciated value (which includes both base and accumulated supplemental depreciation) of the vehicles sold. Changes in accumulated supplemental depreciation are primarily driven by changes in Ford Credit's estimate of the expected auction value at the end of the lease term and changes in Ford Credit's estimate of the number of vehicles that will be returned to it and sold. Depreciation on vehicles subject to operating leases includes early termination losses on operating leases due to customer default events. For additional information, refer to the "Critical Accounting Estimates - Accumulated Depreciation on Vehicles Subject to Operating Leases" section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2023 Form 10-K Report</li>
</ul>
<h2>· Exchange:</h2>
<ul>
<li>· Reflects changes in EBT driven by the effects of converting functional currency income to U.S. dollars</li>
</ul>
<h2>· Other:</h2>
<ul>
<li>· Primarily includes operating expenses, other revenue, insurance expenses, and other income/(loss) at prior period exchange rates</li>
<li>· Changes in operating expenses are primarily driven by salaried personnel costs, facilities costs, and costs associated with the origination and servicing of customer contracts</li>
<li>· In general, other income/(loss) changes are primarily driven by changes in earnings related to market valuation adjustments to derivatives (primarily related to movements in interest rates) and other miscellaneous items</li>
</ul>
<p>Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)</p>
<p>In addition, the following definitions and calculations apply to Ford Credit when used in this Report:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Cash (as shown in the Funding Structure and Liquidity tables) - Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash, excluding amounts related to insurance activities</li>
<li>· Debt (as shown in the Key Metrics and Leverage tables) - Debt on Ford Credit's balance sheets. Includes debt issued in securitizations and payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements. Ford Credit holds the right to receive the excess cash flows not needed to pay the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions</li>
<li>· Earnings Before Taxes ("EBT") - Reflects Ford Credit's income before income taxes</li>
<li>· Loss-to-Receivables ("LTR") Ratio - LTR ratio is calculated using net charge-offs divided by average finance receivables, excluding unearned interest supplements and the allowance for credit losses</li>
<li>· Return on Equity ("ROE" ) (as shown in the Key Metrics table) - Reflects return on equity calculated by annualizing net income for the period and dividing by monthly average equity for the period</li>
<li>· Securitization and Restricted Cash (as shown in the Liquidity table) - Securitization cash is held for the benefit of the securitization investors (for example, a reserve fund). Restricted cash primarily includes cash held to meet certain local governmental and regulatory reserve requirements and cash held under the terms of certain contractual agreements</li>
<li>· Securitizations (as shown in the Public Term Funding Plan table) - Public securitization transactions, Rule 144A offerings sponsored by Ford Credit, and widely distributed offerings by Ford Credit Canada</li>
<li>· Term Asset-Backed Securities ("ABS") (as shown in the Funding Structure table) - Obligations issued in securitization transactions that are payable only out of collections on the underlying securitized assets and related enhancements</li>
<li>· Total Net Receivables (as shown in the Key Metrics table) - Includes finance receivables (retail financing and wholesale) sold for legal purposes and net investment in operating leases included in securitization transactions that do not satisfy the requirements for accounting sale treatment. These receivables and operating leases are reported on Ford Credit's balance sheets and are available only for payment of the debt issued by, and other obligations of, the securitization entities that are parties to those securitization transactions; they are not available to pay the other obligations of Ford Credit or the claims of Ford Credit's other creditors</li>
</ul>
<p>Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)</p>
<h2>Corporate Other</h2>
<p>Corporate Other primarily includes corporate governance expenses, past service pension and OPEB income and expense, interest income (excluding Ford Credit interest income and interest earned on our extended service contract portfolio) and gains and losses from our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (excluding gains and losses on investments in equity securities), and foreign exchange derivatives gains and losses associated with intercompany lending. Corporate governance expenses are primarily administrative, delivering benefit on behalf of the global enterprise, that are not allocated to operating segments. These include expenses related to setting and directing global policy, providing oversight and stewardship, and promoting the Company's interests. In the first quarter of 2024, Corporate Other had a $147 million EBIT loss, unchanged from a year ago.</p>
<h2>Interest on Debt</h2>
<p>Interest on Debt, which consists of interest expense on Company debt excluding Ford Credit, was $278 million in the first quarter of 2024, $30 million lower than a year ago.</p>
<h2>Taxes</h2>
<p>Our Provision for/(Benefit from) income taxes for the first quarter of 2024 was a provision of $278 million, resulting in an effective tax rate of 17.2%.</p>
<p>Our first quarter 2024 adjusted effective tax rate, which excludes special items, was 20.0%.</p>
<p>We regularly review our organizational structure and income tax elections for affiliates in non-U.S. and U.S. tax jurisdictions, which may result in changes in affiliates that are included in or excluded from our U.S. tax return. Any future changes to our structure, as well as any changes in income tax laws in the countries that we operate, could cause increases or decreases to our deferred tax balances and related valuation allowances.</p>

<h2>LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES</h2>
<p>At March 31, 2024, total balance sheet cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash, including Ford Credit and entities held for sale, was $34.7 billion.</p>
<p>We consider our key balance sheet metrics to be: (i) Company cash, which includes cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash, including cash held for sale, excluding Ford Credit's cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash; and (ii) Company liquidity, which includes Company cash, less restricted cash, and total available committed credit lines, excluding Ford Credit's total available committed credit lines.</p>

<p>__________</p>
<p>Liquidity . Our key priority is to maintain a strong balance sheet to withstand potential stress scenarios, while having resources available to invest in and grow our business. At March 31, 2024, we had Company cash of $25.1 billion and liquidity of $42.6 billion. At March 31, 2024, about 86% of Company cash was held by consolidated entities domiciled in the United States.</p>
<p>To be prepared for an economic downturn and other stress scenarios, we target an ongoing Company cash balance at or above $20 billion plus significant additional liquidity above our Company cash target. We expect to have periods when we will be above or below this amount due to: (i) future cash flow expectations, such as for investments in future opportunities, capital investments, debt maturities, pension contributions, or restructuring requirements, (ii) short-term timing differences, and (iii) changes in the global economic or operating environment.</p>
<p>Our Company cash investments primarily include U.S. Department of Treasury obligations, federal agency securities, bank time deposits with investment-grade institutions, investment-grade corporate securities, investment-grade commercial paper, and debt obligations of a select group of nonU.S. governments, non-U.S. governmental agencies, and supranational institutions. The average maturity of these investments is approximately one year and adjusted based on market conditions and liquidity needs. We monitor our Company cash levels and average maturity on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)</p>
<p>Material Cash Requirements. Our material cash requirements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Capital expenditures (for additional information, see the "Changes in Company Cash" section below) and other payments for engineering, software, product development, and implementation of our plans for electric vehicles</li>
<li>· Purchase of raw materials and components to support the manufacturing and sale of vehicles (including electric vehicles), parts, and accessories (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table and the accompanying description of our "Purchase obligations" in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company Excluding Ford Credit" section in Item 7 of our 2023 Form 10-K Report)</li>
<li>· Marketing incentive payments to dealers</li>
<li>· Payments for warranty and field service actions (for additional information, see Note 18 of the Notes to the Financial Statements herein)</li>
<li>· Debt repayments (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company Excluding Ford Credit" section in Item 7 and Note 19 of the Notes the Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K Report)</li>
<li>· Discretionary and mandatory payments to our global pension plans (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company Excluding Ford Credit" section in Item 7 of our 2023 Form 10-K Report, the "Changes in Company Cash" section below, and Note 11 of the Notes to the Financial Statements herein)</li>
<li>· Employee wages, benefits, and incentives</li>
<li>· Operating lease payments (for additional information, see the Aggregate Contractual Obligations table in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources Company Excluding Ford Credit" section in Item 7 and Note 18 of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K Report)</li>
<li>· Cash effects related to the restructuring of our business</li>
<li>· Strategic acquisitions and investments to grow our business, including electrification</li>
</ul>
<p>Subject to approval by our Board of Directors, shareholder distributions in the form of dividend payments and/or a share repurchase program (including share repurchases to offset the anti-dilutive effect of increased share-based compensation) may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash. We target shareholder distributions of 40% to 50% of adjusted free cash flow. Moreover, we may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and other matters.</p>
<p>We plan to utilize our liquidity (as described above) and our cash flows from business operations to fund our material cash requirements.</p>
<p>Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)</p>
<p>Changes in Company Cash. In managing our business, we classify changes in Company cash into operating and non-operating items. Operating items include: Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit EBT, capital spending, depreciation and tooling amortization, changes in working capital, Ford Credit distributions, interest on debt, cash taxes, and all other and timing differences (including timing differences between accrual-based EBIT and associated cash flows). Non-operating items include: restructuring costs, changes in Company debt excluding Ford Credit, contributions to funded pension plans, shareholder distributions, and other items (including gains and losses on investments in equity securities, acquisitions and divestitures, equity investments, and other transactions with Ford Credit).</p>
<p>With respect to "Changes in working capital," in general, the Company excluding Ford Credit carries relatively low trade receivables compared with our trade payables because the majority of our wholesales are financed (primarily by Ford Credit) immediately upon the sale of vehicles to dealers, which generally occurs shortly after being produced. In contrast, our trade payables are based primarily on industry-standard production supplier payment terms of about 45 days. As a result, our cash flow deteriorates if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) decrease while trade payables continue to become due. Conversely, our cash flow improves if wholesale volumes (and the corresponding revenue) increase while new trade payables are generally not due for about 45 days. For example, the suspension of production at most of our assembly plants and lower industry volumes due to COVID-19 in early 2020 resulted in an initial deterioration of our cash flow, while the subsequent resumption of manufacturing operations and return to pre-COVID-19 production levels at most of our assembly plants resulted in a subsequent improvement of our cash flow. Even in normal economic conditions, however, these working capital balances generally are subject to seasonal changes that can impact cash flow. For example, we typically experience cash flow timing differences associated with inventories and payables due to our annual shutdown periods when production, and therefore inventories and wholesale volumes, are usually at their lowest levels, while payables continue to come due and be paid. The net impact of this typically results in cash outflows from changes in our working capital balances during these shutdown periods.</p>
<p>Our finished product inventory at March 31, 2024 was higher than at December 31, 2023, primarily reflecting new vehicle launches and units awaiting final quality review.</p>
<p>In response to, or in anticipation of, supplier disruptions, we may stockpile certain components or raw materials to help prevent disruption in our production of vehicles. Such actions could have a short-term adverse impact on our cash and increase our inventory. Moreover, in order to secure critical materials for production of electric vehicles, we have entered into and we may, in the future, enter into offtake agreements with raw material suppliers and make investments in certain raw material and battery suppliers, including contributing up to a maximum of $6.6 billion in capital to BlueOval SK, LLC over a five-year period ending in 2026. Our actual capital outlay could vary significantly based on the final project costs and potential financing opportunities. Such investments could have an additional adverse impact on our cash in the near-term.</p>
<p>The terms of the offtake agreements we have entered into, and those we may enter into in the future, vary by transaction, though they generally obligate us to purchase a certain percentage or minimum amount of output produced by the counterparty over an agreed upon period of time. The purchase price mechanism included in the offtake agreement is typically based on the market price of the material at the time of delivery. The terms may also include conditions to our obligation to purchase the materials, such as quality or minimum output. Subject to satisfaction of those conditions, we will be obligated to purchase the materials at the cost determined by the purchase price mechanism. As of March 31, 2024, our estimated expenditures for the maximum quantity that we are committed to purchase under these offtake agreements through 2035, subject to certain conditions, consist of approximately $3.9 billion of purchase obligations and approximately $6.9 billion of contingent purchase obligations based on our present forecast; however, our forecast could fluctuate from period to period based on market prices, which could result in significant increases or decreases in our estimate. The actual price paid for these materials will be recorded on our balance sheet at the time of purchase. In addition, as market conditions dictate, we may enter into additional offtake agreements with raw material suppliers or seek to renegotiate existing agreements. Based on the offtake agreements we have entered into thus far, the earliest date by which we could be obligated to purchase any output, subject to satisfaction of the applicable conditions, will be in the second half of 2024. See Item 1A. Risk Factors in our 2023 Form 10-K Report and as updated by our subsequent filings with the SEC for a discussion of the risks related to our offtake agreements and other long-term purchase contracts.</p>
<p>Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)</p>
<p>Financial institutions participate in a supply chain finance ("SCF") program that enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their Ford receivables (i.e., our payment obligations to the suppliers) to the financial institutions on a non-recourse basis in order to be paid earlier than our payment terms provide. Our suppliers' voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms, the amounts we pay, or our liquidity. We have no economic interest in a supplier's decision to participate in the SCF program, and we do not provide any guarantees in connection with it. As of March 31, 2024, the outstanding amount of Ford receivables that suppliers elected to sell to the SCF financial institutions was $213 million. The amount settled through the SCF program during the first quarter of 2024 was $383 million.</p>
<p>Changes in Company cash excluding Ford Credit are summarized below (in billions):</p>

<p>__________</p>
<p>Our first quarter 2024 Net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities was positive $1.4 billion, $1.4 billion lower than a year ago (see page 60 for additional information). The decrease reflects higher inventory and lower net income, offset partially by higher accounts payable as reflected on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Company adjusted free cash flow was negative $0.5 billion, $1.2 billion lower than a year ago. The decrease was primarily driven by lower Company adjusted EBIT excluding Ford Credit and higher capital spending.</p>
<p>Capital spending was $2.1 billion in the first quarter of 2024, an increase of $0.3 billion from a year ago. We now expect full year 2024 capital spending to be in the range of $8 billion to $9 billion.</p>
<p>First quarter 2024 working capital impact was $1.2 billion negative, driven by higher inventory, offset partially by higher trade payables, each compared to December 31, 2023. All other and timing differences were negative $0.2 billion. Timing differences include differences between accrualbased EBIT and the associated cash flows (e.g., marketing incentive and warranty payments to dealers, JV equity income, compensation payments, and pension and OPEB income or expense).</p>
<p>In the first quarter of 2024, we contributed $550 million to our global funded pension plans. We continue to expect to contribute about $1 billion to our global funded pension plans in 2024.</p>
<p>Shareholder distributions were $1.3 billion in the first quarter of 2024, all of which was attributable to our regular and supplemental dividend.</p>
<p>Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)</p>
<p>Available Credit Lines . Total Company committed credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, at March 31, 2024 were $19.4 billion, consisting of $13.5 billion of our corporate credit facility, $2.0 billion of our supplemental revolving credit facility, $1.8 billion of our 364-day revolving credit facility, and $2.2 billion of local credit facilities. At March 31, 2024, the utilized portion of the corporate credit facility was $18 million, representing amounts utilized for letters of credit. In addition, $1.7 billion of committed Company credit lines, excluding Ford Credit, was utilized under local credit facilities for our affiliates as of March 31, 2024.</p>
<p>Our corporate, supplemental, and 364-day revolving credit facilities were amended as of April 22, 2024 to extend the maturity dates of the commitments under each facility and increase the size of our 364-day revolving credit facility. Following the corporate credit facility amendment, $25 million of commitments mature on April 26, 2026, $3.4 billion of commitments mature on April 22, 2027, $0.1 billion of commitments mature on April 26, 2028, and $10.0 billion of commitments mature on April 20, 2029. Following the supplemental revolving credit facility amendment, $2.0 billion of commitments mature on April 22, 2027. Following the 364-day revolving credit facility amendment, $2.5 billion of commitments mature on April 21, 2025.</p>
<p>The corporate, supplemental, and 364-day credit agreements include certain sustainability-linked targets, pursuant to which the applicable margin and facility fees may be adjusted if Ford achieves, or fails to achieve, the specified targets related to global manufacturing facility greenhouse gas emissions, carbon-free electricity consumption, and Ford Europe CO tailpipe emissions. 2</p>
<p>The corporate credit facility is unsecured and free of material adverse change conditions to borrowing, restrictive financial covenants (for example, interest or fixed-charge coverage ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, and minimum net worth requirements), and credit rating triggers that could limit our ability to obtain funding or trigger early repayment. The corporate credit facility contains a liquidity covenant that requires us to maintain a minimum of $4 billion in aggregate of domestic cash, cash equivalents, and loaned and marketable securities and/or availability under the corporate credit facility, supplemental revolving credit facility, and 364-day revolving credit facility. If our senior, unsecured, long-term debt does not maintain at least two investment grade ratings from Fitch, Moody's, and S&amp;P, the guarantees of certain subsidiaries will be required. The terms and conditions of the supplemental and 364-day revolving credit facilities are consistent with our corporate credit facility. Ford Credit has been designated as a subsidiary borrower under the corporate credit facility and the 364-day revolving credit facility.</p>
<p>Debt. As shown in Note 12 of the Notes to the Financial Statements, at March 31, 2024, Company debt excluding Ford Credit was $20.2 billion. This balance is $0.2 billion higher than at December 31, 2023.</p>
<p>Leverage. We manage Company debt (excluding Ford Credit) levels with a leverage framework that targets investment grade credit ratings through a normal business cycle. The leverage framework includes a ratio of total Company debt (excluding Ford Credit), underfunded pension liabilities, operating leases, and other adjustments, divided by Company adjusted EBIT (excluding Ford Credit EBT), and further adjusted to exclude depreciation and tooling amortization (excluding Ford Credit).</p>
<p>Ford Credit's leverage is calculated as a separate business as described in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Ford Credit Segment" section of Item 2. Ford Credit is self-funding and its debt, which is used to fund its operations, is separate from our Company debt excluding Ford Credit.</p>

<p>Liquidity. The following table shows Ford Credit's liquidity sources and utilization (in billions):</p>
<p>| | March 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 | March 31, 2024 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Liquidity Sources (a) | | | |
| Cash | $ 10.3 | $ 10.9 | $ 8.9 |
| Committed asset-backed facilities | 40.5 | 42.9 | 42.6 |
| Other unsecured credit facilities | 2.5 | 2.4 | 2.3 |
| Total liquidity sources | $ 53.3 | $ 56.2 | $ 53.8 |
| Utilization of Liquidity (a) | | | |
| Securitization and restricted cash | $ (3.0) | $ (2.8) | $ (3.4) |
| Committed asset-backed facilities | (24.0) | (27.5) | (23.3) |
| Other unsecured credit facilities | (0.4) | (0.4) | (0.4) |
| Total utilization of liquidity | $ (27.4) | $ (30.7) | $ (27.1) |
| Available Liquidity | $ 25.9 | $ 25.5 | $ 26.7 |
| Other adjustments | 0.2 | 0.2 | 0.3 |
| Net liquidity available for use | $ 26.1 | $ 25.7 | $ 27.0 |</p>
<p>__________</p>
<p>Ford Credit's net liquidity available for use will fluctuate quarterly based on factors including near-term debt maturities, receivable growth and decline, and timing of funding transactions. At March 31, 2024, Ford Credit's net liquidity available for use was $27.0 billion, $1.3 billion higher than yearend 2023, reflecting strong access to public funding markets. At March 31, 2024, Ford Credit's liquidity sources, including cash, committed asset-backed facilities, and unsecured credit facilities, totaled $53.8 billion, down $2.4 billion from year-end 2023.</p>
<p>Material Cash Requirements. Ford Credit's material cash requirements include: (1) the purchase of retail financing and operating lease contracts from dealers and providing wholesale financing for dealers to finance new and used vehicles; and (2) debt repayments (for additional information on debt, see the "Aggregate Contractual Obligations" table in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources - Company Excluding Ford Credit" section in Item 7 and Note 19 of the Notes to the Financial Statements in our 2023 Form 10-K Report). In addition, subject to approval by Ford Credit's Board of Directors, shareholder distributions may require the expenditure of a material amount of cash. Moreover, Ford Credit may be subject to additional material cash requirements that are contingent upon the occurrence of certain events, e.g., legal contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and other matters.</p>
<p>Ford Credit plans to utilize its liquidity (as described above) and its cash flows from business operations to fund its material cash requirements.</p>
<p>Funding and Liquidity Risks. Ford Credit's funding plan is subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond its control, including disruption in the capital markets, that could impact both unsecured debt and asset-backed securities issuance and the effects of regulatory changes on the financial markets. Refer to the "Liquidity - Ford Credit Segment - Funding and Liquidity Risks" section of Item 7 of Part II of our 2023 Form 10-K Report for more information.</p>

<p>Leverage. Ford Credit uses leverage, or the debt-to-equity ratio, to make various business decisions, including evaluating and establishing pricing for finance receivable and operating lease financing, and assessing its capital structure.</p>
<p>The table below shows the calculation of Ford Credit's financial statement leverage (in billions):</p>
<p>| | March 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 | March 31, 2024 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Leverage Calculation | | | |
| Debt | $ 119.6 | $ 129.3 | $ 129.3 |
| Equity (a) | 12.2 | 13.4 | 13.5 |
| Financial statement leverage (to 1) | 9.8 | 9.7 | 9.6 |</p>
<p>__________</p>
<p>Ford Credit plans its leverage by considering market conditions and the risk characteristics of its business. At March 31, 2024, Ford Credit's financial statement leverage was 9.6:1. Ford Credit targets financial statement leverage in the range of 9:1 to 10:1.</p>

<h2>Total Company</h2>
<p>Pension Plans - Funded Balances. As of March 31, 2024, our total Company pension underfunded status reported on our consolidated balance sheets was $1.7 billion and reflects the net funded status at December 31, 2023, updated for: service and interest cost; expected return on assets; curtailments, settlements, and associated interim remeasurement (where applicable); separation expense; actual benefit payments; and cash contributions. For plans without interim remeasurement, the discount rate and rate of expected return assumptions are unchanged from year-end 2023.</p>
<p>Return on Invested Capital ("ROIC"). We analyze total Company performance using an adjusted ROIC financial metric based on an after-tax, rolling four-quarter average. The following table contains the calculation of our ROIC for the periods shown (in billions):</p>

<h2>CREDIT RATINGS</h2>
<p>Our short-term and long-term debt is rated by four credit rating agencies designated as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations ("NRSROs") by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission: DBRS, Fitch, Moody's, and S&amp;P.</p>
<p>In several markets, locally recognized rating agencies also rate us. A credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the credit risk associated with a corporate entity or particular securities issued by that entity. Rating agencies' ratings of us are based on information provided by us and other sources. Credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating agency may have different criteria for evaluating company risk and, therefore, ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency.</p>
<p>There have been no rating actions taken by these NRSROs since the filing of our 2023 Form 10-K Report.</p>
<p>The following table summarizes certain of the credit ratings and outlook presently assigned by these four NRSROs:</p>
<p>| | NRSRO RATINGS | NRSRO RATINGS | NRSRO RATINGS | NRSRO RATINGS | NRSRO RATINGS | NRSRO RATINGS | NRSRO RATINGS |

<h2>OUTLOOK</h2>
<p>We provided 2024 Company guidance in our earnings release furnished on Form 8-K dated April 24, 2024. The guidance is based on our expectations as of April 24, 2024, and assumes no material change to our current assumptions for inflation, logistics issues, production, or macroeconomic conditions. Our actual results could differ materially from our guidance due to risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including those set forth in "Risk Factors" in Item 1A of our 2023 Form 10-K Report and as updated by our subsequent filings with the SEC.</p>
<p>| | 2024 Guidance |

<li>· Ford Model e EBIT loss of $5 billion to $5.5 billion, driven by continued pricing pressure and investments in new vehicles</li>
<li>Ford Credit EBT of about $1.5 billion</li>
</ul>
<p>Our outlook for 2024 assumes:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Flat to modest U.S. industry growth at 16 million to 16.5 million</li>
<li>· Full year of all-new Super Duty, which drives positive pricing and mix in Ford Pro</li>
<li>· Lower industry pricing</li>
<li>· $2 billion of cost reductions in material, freight, and manufacturing</li>

It is to be expected that there may be differences between projected and actual results.

<h2>NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT SUPPLEMENT GAAP MEASURES</h2>
<p>We use both generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and non-GAAP financial measures for operational and financial decision making, and to assess Company and segment business performance. The non-GAAP measures listed below are intended to be considered by users as supplemental information to their equivalent GAAP measures, to aid investors in better understanding our financial results. We believe that these nonGAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying operating results and trends, and a means to compare our period-over-period results. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in items or events being adjusted.</p>
<ul>
<li>· Company Adjusted EBIT (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Income/(Loss) Attributable to Ford) - Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) excludes interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), taxes, and pre-tax special items. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it focuses on underlying operating results and trends, and improves comparability of our period-over-period results. Our management ordinarily excludes special items from its review of the results of the operating segments for purposes of measuring segment profitability and allocating resources. Our categories of pre-tax special items and the applicable significance guideline for each item (which may consist of a group of items related to a single event or action) are as follows:</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pre-Tax Special Item</h2>
<h2>Significance Guideline</h2>
<ul>
<li>$_{∘}$ Pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses</li>
<li>$_{∘}$ No minimum</li>
<li>$_{∘}$ Gains and losses on investments in equity securities</li>
<li>$_{∘}$ No minimum</li>
<li>$_{∘}$ Personnel expenses, supplier- and dealer-related costs, and facility-related charges stemming from our efforts to match production capacity and cost structure to market demand and changing model mix</li>
<li>$_{∘}$ Other items that we do not necessarily consider to be indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities</li>
<li>$_{∘}$ $500 million or more for individual field service actions; generally $100 million or more for other items</li>
<li>When we provide guidance for adjusted EBIT, we do not provide guidance on a net income basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty, including gains and losses on pension and OPEB remeasurements and on investments in equity securities.</li>
<li>· Company Adjusted EBIT Margin (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Company Net Income/(Loss) Margin) - Company Adjusted EBIT margin is Company adjusted EBIT divided by Company revenue. This non-GAAP measure is useful to management and investors because it allows users to evaluate our operating results aligned with industry reporting.</li>
<li>· Adjusted Earnings/(Loss) Per Share (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Earnings/(Loss) Per Share) - Measure of Company's diluted net earnings/(loss) per share adjusted for impact of pre-tax special items (described above), tax special items, and restructuring impacts in noncontrolling interests. The measure provides investors with useful information to evaluate performance of our business excluding items not indicative of earnings from ongoing operating activities. When we provide guidance for adjusted earnings/(loss) per share, we do not provide guidance on an earnings/(loss) per share basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses.</li>
<li>· Adjusted Effective Tax Rate (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Effective Tax Rate) - Measure of Company's tax rate excluding pre-tax special items (described above) and tax special items. The measure provides an ongoing effective rate which investors find useful for historical comparisons and for forecasting. When we provide guidance for adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide guidance on an effective tax rate basis because the GAAP measure will include potentially significant special items that have not yet occurred and are difficult to predict with reasonable certainty prior to year-end, including pension and OPEB remeasurement gains and losses.</li>
<li>$_{∘}$ Generally $100 million or more</li>
</ul>
<p>Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)</p>
<ul>
<li>· Company Adjusted Free Cash Flow (Most Comparable GAAP Measure: Net Cash Provided By/(Used In) Operating Activities) - Measure of Company's operating cash flow excluding Ford Credit's operating cash flows. The measure contains elements management considers operating activities, including Company excluding Ford Credit capital spending, Ford Credit distributions to its parent, and settlement of derivatives. The measure excludes cash outflows for funded pension contributions, restructuring actions, and other items that are considered operating cash flows under U.S. GAAP. This measure is useful to management and investors because it is consistent with management's assessment of the Company's operating cash flow performance. When we provide guidance for Company adjusted free cash flow, we do not provide guidance for net cash provided by/(used in) operating activities because the GAAP measure will include items that are difficult to quantify or predict with reasonable certainty, including cash flows related to the Company's exposures to foreign currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices (separate from any related hedges), Ford Credit's operating cash flows, and cash flows related to special items, including separation payments, each of which individually or in the aggregate could have a significant impact to our net cash provided by/(used in) our operating activities.</li>
<li>· Adjusted ROIC - Calculated as the sum of adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax from the last four quarters, divided by the average invested capital over the last four quarters. Adjusted Return on Invested Capital ("Adjusted ROIC") provides management and investors with useful information to evaluate the Company's after-cash tax operating return on its invested capital for the period presented. Adjusted net operating profit/(loss) after cash tax measures operating results less special items, interest on debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), and certain pension/OPEB costs. Average invested capital is the sum of average balance sheet equity, debt (excl. Ford Credit Debt), and net pension/OPEB liability.</li>

<h2>ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET ADOPTED</h2>
<p>For a discussion of recent accounting standards, see Note 2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.</p>
<h2>ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.</h2>
<h2>Company Excluding Ford Credit</h2>
<p>Foreign Currency Risk. The net fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts (including adjustments for credit risk) as of March 31, 2024, was a liability of $84 million, compared with a liability of $319 million as of December 31, 2023. The potential change in the fair value from a 10% change in the underlying exchange rates, in U.S. dollar terms, would have been $3 billion at March 31, 2024, compared with $3.1 billion at December 31, 2023.</p>
<p>Commodity Price Risk. The net fair value of commodity forward contracts (including adjustments for credit risk) as of March 31, 2024, was a liability of $28 million, compared with a liability of $9 million at December 31, 2023. The potential change in the fair value from a 10% change in the underlying commodity prices would have been $197 million at March 31, 2024, compared with $203 million at December 31, 2023.</p>
<h2>Ford Credit Segment</h2>
<p>Interest Rate Risk . To provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its pre-tax cash flow to changes in interest rates, Ford Credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous decrease or increase of one percentage point in all interest rates across all maturities (a "parallel shift"), as well as a base case that assumes that all interest rates remain constant at existing levels. Maturing assets and liabilities are also instantaneously reinvested, capturing 100% of any hypothetical change in interest rates. The differences in pre-tax cash flow between these scenarios and the base case over a 12-month period represent an estimate of the sensitivity of Ford Credit's pre-tax cash flow . Under this model, Ford Credit estimates that at March 31, 2024, all else constant, such a decrease in interest rates would decrease its pre-tax cash flow by $87 million over the next 12 months, compared with a decrease of $78 million at December 31, 2023 . In reality, new assets and liabilities may not immediately capture changes in interest rates, and interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous, parallel, or move exactly the one percentage point assumed in Ford Credit's analysis. As a result, the actual impact to pre-tax cash flow could be higher or lower than the results detailed above.</p>
<h2>ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures.</h2>
<p>Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. James D. Farley, Jr., our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), and John T. Lawler, our Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), have performed an evaluation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures, as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"), as of March 31, 2024, and each has concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the CEO and CFO to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.</p>
<p>Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.</p>
<h2>ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings.</h2>
<h2>ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS</h2>
<p>Any legal proceeding arising under any federal, state, or local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or primarily for the purpose of protecting the environment, in which (i) a governmental authority is a party, and (ii) we believe there is the possibility of monetary sanctions (exclusive of interest and costs) in excess of $1,000,000 is described on page 35 of our 2023 Form 10-K Report.</p>
<h2>OTHER MATTERS</h2>
<p>Brazilian Tax Matters (as previously reported on page 35 of our 2023 Form 10-K Report). One Brazilian state (São Paulo) and the Brazilian federal tax authority currently have outstanding substantial tax assessments against Ford Motor Company Brasil Ltda. ("Ford Brazil") related to state and federal tax incentives Ford Brazil received for its operations in the Brazilian state of Bahia. The São Paulo assessment is part of a broader conflict among various states in Brazil. The federal legislature enacted laws designed to encourage the states to end that conflict, and in 2017 the states reached an agreement on a framework for resolution. Ford Brazil continues to pursue a resolution under the framework and expects the amount of any remaining assessments by the states to be resolved under that framework. The federal assessments are outside the scope of the legislation.</p>
<p>All of the outstanding assessments have been appealed to the relevant administrative court of each jurisdiction. To proceed with an appeal within the judicial court system, an appellant may be required to post collateral. To date, we have not been required to post any collateral. If we are required to post collateral, which could be in excess of $1 billion, we expect it to be in the form of fixed assets, surety bonds, and/or letters of credit, but we may be required to post cash collateral. Although the ultimate resolution of these matters may take many years, we consider our overall risk of loss to be remote.</p>
<p>Transit Connect Customs Penalty Notice (as previously reported on page 36 of our 2023 Form 10-K Report) . U.S. Customs and Border Protection ("CBP") ruled in 2013 that Transit Connects imported as passenger wagons and later converted into cargo vans are subject to the 25% duty applicable to cargo vehicles, rather than the 2.5% duty applicable to passenger vehicles. We filed a challenge in the U.S. Court of International Trade ("CIT"), and CIT ruled in our favor in 2017. CBP subsequently filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which ruled in favor of CBP. Following the U.S. Supreme Court's denial of our petition for a writ of certiorari in 2020, we paid the increased duties for certain prior imports, plus interest, and disclosed that CBP might assert a claim for penalties. Subsequently, CBP issued a penalty notice to us dated July 22, 2021, and on November 18, 2021, CBP assessed against us a monetary penalty of $1.3 billion and additional duties of $181 million, plus interest. On March 11, 2024, Ford entered into a settlement agreement for this matter, which included a payment of $365 million to the United States.</p>
<h2>ITEM 5. Other Information.</h2>
<p>During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, no director or officer of the Company adopted, modified, or terminated a "Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement" or a "non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement" as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.</p>
