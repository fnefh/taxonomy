<h2>BLUE BIRD CORPORATION</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<p>(Unaudited)</p>
<h2>1. Nature of Business and Basis of Presentation</h2>
<h2>Nature of Business</h2>
<p>Blue Bird Body Company ("BBBC"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Blue Bird Corporation, was incorporated in 1958 and has manufactured, assembled and sold school buses to a variety of municipal, federal and commercial customers since 1927. The majority of BBBC's sales are made to an independent dealer network, which in turn sells buses to ultimate end users. References in these notes to condensed consolidated financial statements to "Blue Bird," the "Company," "we," "our," or "us" relate to Blue Bird Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, unless the context specifically indicates otherwise. We are headquartered in Macon, Georgia.</p>
<h2>Basis of Presentation</h2>
<p>The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.</p>
<p>The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial reporting and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. The Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30 with its quarters consisting of thirteen weeks in most years. The fiscal years ending September 27, 2025 ("fiscal 2025") and ended September 28, 2024 ("fiscal 2024") consist or consisted of 52 weeks. The first quarters of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 both included 13 weeks.</p>
<p>In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of financial results have been made. Such adjustments consist of only those of a normal recurring nature. Operating results for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.</p>
<p>The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet data as of September 28, 2024 was derived from the Company's audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. For additional information, including the Company's significant accounting policies, refer to the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes as of and for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024 as set forth in the Company's fiscal 2024 Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on November 25, 2024.</p>
<h2>Impacts of Supply Chain Constraints on Our Business</h2>
<p>The global automotive industry supply chain constraints that arose subsequent to the novel coronavirus pandemic known as "COVID-19" and that were further exacerbated by additional stress resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 continued to impact our business and operations during the first quarters of fiscal 2024 and 2025. Specifically, they continued to result in higher purchasing costs, including freight costs incurred to deliver critical components, to procure the raw materials inventory needed to produce buses to fulfill sales orders. Additionally, there were still occasional shortages of certain critical components that limited the number and/or mix of school buses that we could produce and sell. Nonetheless, ongoing improvements in manufacturing operations that have resulted in the consistent production of buses, when coupled with periodic pricing actions taken to ensure that the increased sales prices charged for buses keep pace with increased costs to procure inventory to produce buses, have resulted in the Company reporting gross profit and gross margin in the first quarters of fiscal 2025 and 2024 that exceeded those reported in pre-pandemic fiscal years.</p>
<p>Significant uncertainty still exists concerning the magnitude and duration of the ongoing supply chain constraints and accordingly, precludes any prediction as to the ultimate severity of the adverse impacts on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.</p>
<h2>Use of Estimates and Assumptions</h2>
<p>The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. At the date of the financial statements, these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, and during the reporting period, these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. For example, significant management judgments are required in determining excess, obsolete, or</p>
<p>unsalable inventory; the allowance for doubtful accounts; potential impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets; and the accounting for self-insurance reserves, warranty reserves, pension obligations, income taxes, environmental liabilities and contingencies. Future events, including the extent and duration of continued supply chain constraints and their related economic impacts, and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty, and, accordingly, the Company's accounting estimates require the exercise of judgment. The accounting estimates used in the preparation of the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements may change as new events occur, as more experience is acquired, as additional information is obtained and as the Company's operating environment changes. The Company evaluates and updates its assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in the Company's evaluations. Actual results could differ from the estimates that the Company has used.</p>
<h2>2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recently Issued Accounting Standards</h2>
<p>The Company's significant accounting policies are described in the Company's fiscal 2024 Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on November 25, 2024. Our senior management has reviewed these significant accounting policies and related disclosures and determined that there were no significant changes in our critical accounting policies in the three months ended December 28, 2024.</p>
<h2>Recently Issued Accounting Standards</h2>
<p>ASU 2023-07 On November 27, 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures , which requires public business entities ("PBEs") to disclose information about their reportable segments' significant expenses on an interim and annual basis. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.</p>
<p>ASU 2023-09 On December 14, 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures , which requires entities to disclose more detailed information in their reconciliation of their statutory tax rate to their effective tax rate. PBEs are required to provide this incremental detail in a numerical, tabular format. The ASU also requires entities to disclose more detailed information about income taxes paid, including by jurisdiction; pretax income (or loss) from continuing operations; and income tax expense (or benefit). The ASU is effective for PBEs in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.</p>
<p>ASUs 2024-03 &amp; 2025-01 On November 4, 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses , which requires PBEs to disclose disaggregated information about certain income statement expense line items. On January 6, 2025, the FASB issued ASU 2025-01, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Clarifying the Effective Date , to clarify the effective date of ASU 2024-03, which is for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027.</p>
<p>The new ASUs will not impact amounts recorded in the financial statements but instead, will require more detailed disclosures in the footnotes to the financial statement. The Company plans to provide the updated disclosures required by the ASUs in the periods in which they are effective.</p>

</table>
<p>Term loan borrowings are recognized on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at the unpaid principal balance, and are not subject to fair value measurement; however, given the variable rates on the loans, the Company estimates that the unpaid principal balance approximates fair value. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, the term loans would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. At December 28, 2024 and September 28, 2024, $ 95.0 million and $96.3 million, respectively, were outstanding on the term loans.</p>
<p>At December 28, 2024 and September 28, 2024, the stated interest rates on the term loans were6.4% and 6.9%, respectively. At December 28, 2024 and September 28, 2024, the weighted-average annual effective interest rates for the term loans were 7.0% and 8.2%, respectively, which include amortization of the deferred financing costs.</p>
<p>At December 28, 2024, $6.7 million of letters of credit were outstanding, which reduces the availability on the revolving line of credit. There wereno borrowings outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility; therefore, the Company would have been able to borrow $143.3 million on the revolving line of credit.</p>
<p>Interest expense on all indebtedness was $1.9 million and $3.6 million for the three months ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively.</p>

<h2>5. Income Taxes</h2>
<p>Income tax provisions for interim periods are based on estimated annual income tax rates, adjusted to reflect the effects of any significant infrequent or unusual items that are required to be discretely recognized within the current interim period. The effective tax rates in the periods presented are largely based upon the annual forecasted pre-tax earnings mix and allocation of certain expenses in various taxing jurisdictions where the Company conducts its business, primarily in the United States of America ("U.S."). In periods where our pre-tax income approximates or is equal to break-even, the effective tax rates for quarter-to-date and full-year periods may not be meaningful due to discrete period items.</p>
<h2>Three Months</h2>
<p>The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 28, 2024 was24.4% and differed from the statutory federal income tax rate of21%. The increase was primarily due to the impacts from state taxes and certain permanent items on the federal rate, which were partially offset by the impacts from federal and state tax credits (net of valuation allowances) and discrete period items during the quarter.</p>
<p>The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 30, 2023 was25.9% and differed from the statutory federal income tax rate of21%. The increase was primarily due to the impacts from state taxes and certain permanent items on the federal rate, which were partially offset by the impacts from federal and state tax credits (net of valuation allowances) and discrete period items during the quarter.</p>
<h2>6. Guarantees, Commitments and Contingencies</h2>
<h2>Litigation</h2>
<p>At December 28, 2024, the Company had a number of product liability and other cases pending. Management believes that, considering the Company's insurance coverage and its intention to vigorously defend its positions, the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial statements.</p>
<h2>Environmental</h2>
<p>The Company is subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials used in its manufacturing processes. Failure by the Company to comply with present and future regulations could subject it to future liabilities. In addition, such regulations could require the Company to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations. The Company is currently not involved in any material environmental proceedings and therefore, management believes that the resolution of pending environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial statements.</p>
<h2>7. Segment Information</h2>
<p>We manage our business in two operating segments: (i) the Bus segment, which includes the manufacturing and assembly of buses to be sold to a variety of customers across the U.S., Canada and in certain limited international markets; and (ii) the Parts segment, which consists primarily of the purchase of parts from third parties to be sold to dealers within the Company's network and certain large fleet customers. Management evaluates the segments based primarily upon revenues and gross profit, which are reflected in the tables below for the periods presented:</p>

<h2>11. Stockholder Transaction Costs</h2>
<p>On December 14, 2023, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with BofA Securities, Inc. and Barclays Capital Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters and American Securities LLC ("Selling Stockholder"), pursuant to which the Selling Stockholder agreed to sell 2,500,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $25.10 per share ("Offering").</p>
<p>The Offering was conducted pursuant to a prospectus supplement, dated December 14, 2023, to the prospectus dated December 22, 2021 included in the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-261858) that was initially filed with the SEC on December 23, 2021.</p>
<p>The Offering closed on December 19, 2023. Although the Company did not sell any shares or receive any proceeds from the Offering, it was required to pay certain expenses in connection with the transaction that totaled approximately $1.2 million for the three months ended December 30, 2023. The $1.2 million of expense is included within other income (expense), net on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended December 30, 2023. No such expense was incurred in the three months ended December 28, 2024.</p>
<h2>12. Equity Investment in Affiliates</h2>
<p>The Company has made investments in the below entities and utilizes the equity method of accounting to record its interest in them as it does not have control to direct the activities that most significantly impact their financial performance based on the shared powers of the venture partners. The carrying amount of the equity method investments is adjusted for any contribution that the Company makes to them as well as for the Company's proportionate share of net earnings or losses and any dividends received.</p>
<h2>Micro Bird Holdings, Inc.</h2>
<p>The Company holds a 50% equity interest in Micro Bird Holdings, Inc. ("Micro Bird"), our unconsolidated Canadian joint venture that produces Blue Bird Micro Bird by Girardin Type A buses in Drummondville, Quebec.</p>
<p>In recognizing the Company's 50% portion of Micro Bird's net income or loss, the Company recorded $2.1 million and $2.0 million in equity in net income of nonconsolidated affiliates on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended December 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively.</p>
<p>In December 2023, Micro Bird paid dividends to all common stockholders, with the Company's proportionate share totaling $3.0 million, gross of required withholding taxes. The dividend was recorded as a reduction in the balance of equity investment in affiliates on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and is presented as a cash inflow in the operating section of the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. No dividends were paid in the three months ended December 28, 2024.</p>
<p>At December 28, 2024 and September 28, 2024, the carrying value of the Company's investment in Micro Bird included within equity investment in affiliates on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets was $26.6 million and $24.4 million, respectively.</p>

<p>During the three months ended December 28, 2024, the Company made a $0.5 million cash contribution to CBS and during the three months ended December 30, 2023, the Company recorded the $7.4 million fair value of warrants it issued to the joint venture partner as its initial investment in CBS, both of which increased the balance of equity investment in affiliates on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.</p>
<p>In recognizing the Company's 50% portion of CBS' net income or loss, the Company recorded $(0.3) million (a loss) in equity in net income of non-consolidated affiliates on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three months ended December 28, 2024, while no amount was recorded in the three months ended December 30, 2023. CBS paid no dividends in either period.</p>
<p>At December 28, 2024 and September 28, 2024, the carrying value of the Company's investment in CBS included within equity investment in affiliates on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets was $7.8 million and $7.7 million, respectively.</p>
<h2>13. Stockholders' Equity</h2>
<h2>Share Repurchase Program and Common Stock Retirement</h2>
<p>On January 31, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized and approved a share repurchase program for up to $60 million of outstanding shares of the Company's common stock over a period of 24 months, expiring January 31, 2026. Under the share repurchase program, the Company may repurchase shares through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase transactions, block purchases or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.</p>

<h2>Executive Overview</h2>
<p>Blue Bird is the leading independent designer and manufacturer of school buses. Our longevity and reputation in the school bus industry have made Blue Bird an iconic American brand. We distinguish ourselves from our principal competitors by dedicating our focus to the design, engineering, manufacture and sale of school buses, and related parts. As the only principal manufacturer of chassis and body production specifically designed for school bus applications in the United States of America ("U.S."), Blue Bird is recognized as an industry leader for school bus innovation, safety, product quality/reliability/durability, efficiency, and lower operating costs. In addition, Blue Bird is the market leader in alternative powered product offerings with its propane powered, gasoline powered and all-electric powered school buses.</p>
<p>Blue Bird sells its buses and parts through an extensive network of U.S. and Canadian dealers that, in their territories, are exclusive to Blue Bird on Type C and Type D school buses. Blue Bird also sells directly to major fleet operators, the U.S. Government, state governments, and authorized dealers in certain limited foreign countries.</p>
<p>Throughout this Report, we refer to the fiscal year ending September 27, 2025 as "fiscal 2025," the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024 as "fiscal 2024," the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 as "fiscal 2023," the fiscal year ended October 1, 2022 as "fiscal 2022" and the fiscal year ended October 2, 2021 as "fiscal 2021." There will be or were 52 weeks in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024. The first quarters of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 both included 13 weeks.</p>
<h2>Impacts of Supply Chain Constraints on Our Business</h2>
<p>During the second half of fiscal 2021, the Company, and automotive industry as a whole, began experiencing significant supply chain constraints that arose subsequent to the novel coronavirus pandemic known as "COVID-19." Additionally, the already challenged global supply chain for automotive parts was further impacted, including continuing escalating inventory purchase costs, by additional stress resulting from Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. These supply chain disruptions had a significant adverse impact on our operations and results during the second half of fiscal 2021 and all of fiscal 2022. Specifically, they resulted in higher purchasing costs, including freight costs incurred to expedite receipt of critical components, increased manufacturing inefficiencies and our inability to complete the production of buses to fulfill sales orders, that outpaced the sales prices that we charged for the buses we sold during these periods.</p>
<p>During fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, there were slight improvements in the supply chain's ability to deliver the parts and components necessary to support our production operations, resulting in increased (i) manufacturing efficiencies and (ii) production of buses to fulfill sales orders. However, the higher costs charged by suppliers to procure inventory continued over these same periods and adversely impacted our operations and results. However, the cumulative increases in sales prices we charged for our buses outpaced the higher costs we paid to procure inventory, resulting in gross profit and gross margin in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024 that were consistent with, or better than, historic levels experienced prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Supply chain disruptions continued into the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as there were still occasional shortages of certain critical components as well as ongoing increases in raw materials costs, both of which impacted our business and operations by limiting the number and/or mix of school buses that we could produce and sell as well as increasing the costs to manufacture buses. Nonetheless, the lessons learned, and resulting actions taken, by management over the past three fiscal years allowed the Company to better navigate these supply chain challenges and consistently produce buses to fulfill sales orders. Ongoing improvements in manufacturing operations, when coupled with periodic pricing actions taken by the Company to ensure that the increased sales prices charged for buses keep pace with increased costs to procure inventory to produce the buses, allowed the Company to report gross profit and gross margin that are materially consistent with those reported in fiscal 2024.</p>
<p>New bus orders during fiscal 2024 and continuing into fiscal 2025 remained robust, primarily due to a combination of (i) pent-up demand resulting from the cumulative effect of the COVID-19 pandemic when many school systems conducted virtual learning and (ii) the challenged global supply chain for automotive parts that hindered the school bus industry's ability to produce and sell buses as discussed previously above. Accordingly, the Company's backlog remained strong at approximately 4,800 units and 4,400 units as of September 28, 2024 and December 28, 2024, respectively, despite it selling 9,000 units in fiscal 2024 and over 2,100 units in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.</p>
<p>In general, management believes that supply chain disruptions, including those resulting from current or future military conflicts, could continue in future periods and could materially impact our results if we are unable to i) obtain parts and supplies in sufficient quantities to meet our production needs and/or ii) pass along rising costs to our customers. They have resulted, and could continue to result, in significant economic disruption and have adversely affected our business. They could adversely impact our business for the remainder of fiscal 2025 and perhaps beyond. Significant uncertainty exists concerning the magnitude of the impact and duration of ongoing supply chain constraints and their potential impact on the overall economy, both within the U.S and globally. Accordingly, the magnitude and duration of any production and supply chain disruptions and their related financial impacts on our business cannot be estimated at this time.</p>
<p>The impacts from supply chain constraints on the Company's business and operations beginning during the second half of fiscal 2021 and continuing into fiscal 2025 negatively affected our inventory procurement costs, gross profit, income and cash flows. We continue to monitor and assess the ability of suppliers to maintain operations and to provide parts and supplies in sufficient quantities to meet our production needs and our ability to maintain continuous production during the remainder of fiscal 2025 and beyond. See PART I, Item 1.A. "Risk Factors," of our fiscal 2024 Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on November 25, 2024, for a discussion of the material risks we believe we face particularly related to supply chain disruptions and related constraints.</p>
<h2>Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates, Recent Accounting Pronouncements</h2>
<p>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Blue Bird evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis, based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.</p>
<p>The Company's accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are described in the Company's fiscal 2024 Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on November 25, 2024, under the caption "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates," which description is incorporated herein by reference. Our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures and determined that there were no significant changes in our critical accounting policies during the three months ended December 28, 2024.</p>
<h2>Recent Accounting Pronouncements</h2>
<p>See Note 2 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report for a discussion of new and/or recently adopted accounting pronouncements, as applicable.</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<h2>Factors Affecting Our Revenues</h2>
<p>Our revenues are driven primarily by the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Property tax revenues . Property tax revenues are one of the major sources of funding for school districts, and therefore new school buses. Property tax revenues are a function of land and building prices, relying on assessments of property value by state or county assessors and millage rates voted by the local electorate.</li>
<li>· Student enrollment and delivery mechanisms for learning. Increases or decreases in the number of school bus riders have a direct impact on school district demand. Evolving protocols for public health concerns and/or continued technological advancements could shift the future form of educational delivery away from in-person learning on a more permanent basis, with increased remote learning reasonably expected to decrease the number of school bus riders.</li>
<li>· Revenue mix . We are able to charge more for certain of our products (e.g., Type C propane powered school buses, electric powered buses, Type D buses, and buses with higher option content) than other products. The mix of products sold in any fiscal period can directly impact our revenues for the period.</li>
<li>· Strength of the dealer network . We rely on our dealers, as well as a small number of major fleet operators, to be the direct point of contact with school districts and their purchasing agents. An effective dealer is capable of expanding revenues within a given school district by matching that district's needs to our capabilities, offering options that would not otherwise be provided to the district.</li>
<li>· Pricing . Our products are sold to school districts throughout the U.S. and Canada. Each state and each Canadian province has its own set of regulations that governs the purchase of products, including school buses, by their school districts. We and our dealers must navigate these regulations, purchasing procedures, and the districts' specifications in order to reach mutually acceptable price terms. Pricing may or may not be favorable to us, depending upon a number of factors impacting purchasing decisions. Additionally, in certain cases, prices originally quoted with dealers and school districts may have become less favorable, or more unfavorable, to us given increasing inventory costs between the time the sales order was contractually agreed upon and the bus is built and delivered as a result of ongoing supply chain disruptions and general inflationary pressures.</li>
<li>· Buying patterns of major fleets . Major fleets regularly compete against one another for existing accounts. Fleets are also continuously trying to win the business of school districts that operate their own transportation services. These activities can have either a positive or negative impact on our sales, depending on the brand preference of the fleet that wins the business. Major fleets also periodically review their fleet sizes and replacement patterns due to funding availability as well as the profitability of existing routes. These actions can impact total purchases by fleets in a given year.</li>
<li>· Seasonality. In the fiscal years preceding the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, our sales were subject to seasonal variation based on the school calendar with the peak season during our third and fourth fiscal quarters. Sales during the third and fourth fiscal quarters were typically greater than the first and second fiscal quarters due to the desire of municipalities to have any new buses that they ordered available to them at the beginning of the new school year. Since 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic impacting the demand for Company products and the impact of the subsequent supply chain constraints hindering the Company's ability to produce and sell buses as discussed previously above, seasonality has become unpredictable. Seasonality and variations from historical seasonality have impacted the comparison of results between fiscal periods.</li>
<li>· Inflation. As discussed previously above, supply chain disruptions developing subsequent to the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine have significantly increased our inventory purchase costs, including freight costs incurred to deliver critical components, reflected in cost of goods sold during all of fiscal 2022 and continuing, to a lesser extent, into fiscal 2023, fiscal 2024 and the first quarter of fiscal 2025. In response, the Company announced a number of sales price increases over this same period that applied to new sales orders and, in one limited circumstance, partially applied to backlog orders that were both intended to mitigate the impact of rising purchase costs on our operations and results. These cumulative price increases have had a significant, positive impact on sales and gross profit during fiscal 2023, fiscal 2024 and continuing into the first quarter of fiscal 2025.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Factors Affecting Our Expenses and Other Items</h2>
<p>Our expenses and other line items on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations are principally driven by the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>· Cost of goods sold . The components of our cost of goods sold consist of material costs (principally powertrain components, steel and rubber, as well as aluminum and copper) including freight costs, labor expense, and overhead. Our cost of goods sold may vary from period to period due to changes in sales volume and/or mix, efforts by certain suppliers to pass through the economics associated with key commodities, fluctuations in freight costs, design changes with respect to specific components, design changes with respect to specific bus models, wage increases for plant labor, productivity of plant labor, delays in receiving materials and other logistical problems, and the impact of overhead items such as utilities.</li>
<li>· Selling, general and administrative expenses . Our selling, general and administrative expenses include costs associated with our selling and marketing efforts, engineering, centralized finance, human resources, purchasing, information technology services, along with other administrative matters and functions. In most instances, other than direct costs associated with sales and marketing programs, the principal component of these costs is salary expense. Changes from period to period are typically driven by the number of our employees, as well as by merit increases provided to experienced personnel.</li>
<li>· Interest expense . Our interest expense relates to costs associated with our debt instruments and reflects both the amount of indebtedness and the interest rate that we are required to pay on our debt. Interest expense also includes unrealized gains or losses from interest rate hedges, if any, and changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships, if any, as well as expenses related to debt guarantees, if any.</li>
<li>· Income taxes . We make estimates of the amounts to recognize for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. In addition, provisions are established for withholding taxes related to the transfer of cash between jurisdictions and for uncertain tax positions taken, if any.</li>
<li>· Other expense/income, net. This balance includes periodic pension expense or income as well as gains or losses on foreign currency, if any. Other amounts not associated with operating expenses may also be included in this balance.</li>
<li>· Equity in net income or loss of non-consolidated affiliates . We include in this line item our 50% share of net income or loss from our investments in Micro Bird Holdings, Inc. and Clean Bus Solutions, LLC, our unconsolidated joint ventures.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Non-GAAP Financial Measures We Use to Evaluate Our Performance</h2>
<p>The condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Report in Item 1. "Financial Statements (Unaudited)" are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. This Report also includes the following financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP ("non-GAAP"): "Adjusted EBITDA;" "Adjusted EBITDA Margin;" and "Free Cash Flow." Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow are financial metrics that are utilized by management and the Board of Directors, as and when applicable, to determine (a) the annual cash bonus payouts, if any, to be made to certain employees based upon the terms of the Company's Management Incentive Plan, and (b) whether the performance criteria have been met for the vesting of certain equity awards granted annually to certain members of management based upon the terms of the Company's Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan. Additionally, consolidated EBITDA, which is an adjusted EBITDA metric defined by our Credit Agreement (defined below) that could differ from Adjusted EBITDA discussed above as the adjustments to the calculations are not uniform, is used to determine the Company's ongoing compliance with several financial covenant requirements, including being utilized in the denominator of the calculation of the Total Net Leverage Ratio ("TNLR"), which is also utilized in determining the interest rate we pay on borrowings under our Credit Agreement (defined below). Accordingly, management views these non-GAAP financial metrics as key for the above purposes and as a useful way to evaluate the performance of our operations as discussed further below.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income or loss prior to interest income; interest expense including the component of operating lease expense (which is presented as a single operating expense in selling, general and administrative expenses in our U.S. GAAP financial statements) that represents interest expense on lease liabilities; income taxes; and depreciation and amortization including the component of operating lease expense (which is presented as a single operating expense in selling, general and administrative expenses in our U.S. GAAP financial statements) that represents amortization charges on right-of-use lease assets; as adjusted for certain non-cash charges or credits that we may record on a recurring basis such as share-based compensation expense and unrealized gains or losses on certain derivative financial instruments as well as certain charges such as (i) transaction related costs or (ii) discrete expenses related to major cost cutting and/or operational transformation initiatives. While certain of the charges that are added back in the Adjusted EBITDA calculation, such as transaction related costs and major cost cutting and/or operational transformation initiatives, represent operating expenses that may be recorded in more than one annual period, the significant project or transaction giving rise to such expenses is not considered to be indicative of the Company's normal operations. Accordingly, we believe that</p>
<p>these, as well as the other credits and charges that comprise the amounts utilized in the determination of Adjusted EBITDA described above, should not be used in evaluating the Company's ongoing annual operating performance.</p>
<p>We define Adjusted EBITDA Margin as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not measures of performance defined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The measures are used as a supplement to U.S. GAAP results in evaluating certain aspects of our business, as described below.</p>
<p>We believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are useful to investors in evaluating our performance because the measures consider the performance of our ongoing operations, excluding decisions made with respect to capital investment, financing, and certain other significant initiatives or transactions as outlined in the preceding paragraphs. We believe the non-GAAP measures offer additional financial metrics that, when coupled with the U.S. GAAP results and the reconciliation to U.S. GAAP results, provide a more complete understanding of our results of operations and the factors and trends affecting our business.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin should not be considered as alternatives to net income or loss as an indicator of our performance or as alternatives to any other measure prescribed by U.S. GAAP as there are limitations to using such non-GAAP measures. Although we believe that Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin may enhance an evaluation of our operating performance based on recent revenue generation and product/overhead cost control because they exclude the impact of prior decisions made about capital investment, financing, and certain other significant initiatives or transactions, (i) other companies in Blue Bird's industry may define Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin differently than we do and, as a result, they may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in Blue Bird's industry, and (ii) Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin exclude certain financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance.</p>
<p>We compensate for these limitations by providing disclosure of the differences between Adjusted EBITDA and U.S. GAAP results, including providing a reconciliation to U.S. GAAP results, to enable investors to perform their own analysis of our ongoing operating results.</p>
<p>Our measure of Free Cash Flow is used in addition to and in conjunction with results presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and it should not be relied upon to the exclusion of U.S. GAAP financial measures. Free Cash Flow reflects an additional way of evaluating our liquidity that, when viewed with our U.S. GAAP results, provides a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our cash flows. We strongly encourage investors to review our financial statements and publiclyfiled reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.</p>
<p>We define Free Cash Flow as total cash provided by/used in operating activities as adjusted for net cash paid for the acquisition of fixed assets and intangible assets. We use Free Cash Flow, and ratios based on Free Cash Flow, to conduct and evaluate our business because, although it is similar to cash flow from operations, we believe it is a more conservative measure of cash flow since purchases of fixed assets and intangible assets are a necessary component of ongoing manufacturing operations. Accordingly, we expect Free Cash Flow to be less than operating cash flows.</p>
<h2>Our Segments</h2>
<p>We manage our business in two operating segments, which are also our reportable segments: (i) the Bus segment, which involves the design, engineering, manufacture and sale of school buses and extended warranties; and (ii) the Parts segment, which includes the sale of replacement bus parts. Financial information is reported on the basis that it is used internally by the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") in evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments. The President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company has been identified as the CODM. Management evaluates the segments based primarily upon revenues and gross profit.</p>

<p>Net sales . Net sales were $313.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, a decrease of $3.8 million, or 1.2%, compared to $317.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in net sales is primarily due to Bus customer and product mix changes that were partially offset by a slight increase in Parts sales.</p>
<p>Bus sales decreased $5.3 million, or 1.8%, reflecting a1.9% decrease in average sales price per unit. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, 2,130 units were booked compared to 2,129 units booked for the same period in fiscal 2024. The small decrease in unit price for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the same period in fiscal 2024 was primarily due to customer and product mix changes, although both quarters were negatively impacted by supply chain constraints that limited the Company's ability to produce and deliver buses due to shortages of critical components.</p>
<p>Parts sales increased $1.5 million, or 6.2%, for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. This increase is primarily attributed to price increases, driven by ongoing inflationary pressures, as well as higher fulfillment volumes and slight variations due to product and channel mix.</p>
<p>Cost of goods sold . Total cost of goods sold was $253.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, a decrease of $0.5 million, or 0.2%, compared to $254.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. As a percentage of net sales, total cost of goods sold increased from 80.0% to 80.8%, primarily due to the impact of ongoing inflationary pressures relating to the procurement of inventory as well as finalizing the union contract in May 2024, which increased the labor costs for our covered production and supply chain employees.</p>
<p>Bus segment cost of goods sold decreased $1.2 million, or 0.5%, for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the same period in fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by customer and product mix changes as the average cost of goods sold per unit for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was 0.5% lower compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. However, such decrease was partially offset by increases in manufacturing costs attributable to a) increased raw materials costs resulting from ongoing inflationary pressures, b) ongoing supply chain disruptions that resulted in higher purchase costs for components and c) higher labor costs resulting from finalizing the union contract in May 2024.</p>
<p>The $0.6 million, or 5.2%, increase in Parts segment cost of goods sold for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024 was primarily due to increased purchased parts costs, driven by ongoing inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions, as well as slight variations due to product and channel mix.</p>
<p>Operating profit . Operating profit was $33.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, a decrease of $4.9 million compared to operating profit of $38.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Profitability was primarily impacted by a decrease of $3.2 million in gross profit as outlined in the revenue and cost of goods sold discussions above. It was also impacted by an increase of $1.7 million in selling, general and administrative expenses, primarily due to an increase in labor costs.</p>
<p>Interest expense . Interest expense was $1.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, a decrease of $1.7 million, or 47.3%, compared to $3.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the stated term loan interest rate from 8.5% at December 30, 2023 to 6.4% at December 28, 2024, as well as lower outstanding borrowings in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024.</p>
<p>Other income (expense), net. Other income, net was $2.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, an increase of $4.1 million, or 338.8%, compared to $1.2 million of other expense, net for the same period in fiscal 2024.</p>
<p>During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company recorded pension income of approximately $0.4 million compared with pension expense of less than $0.1 million for the same period in fiscal 2024.</p>
<p>Additionally, during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company sold certain state emissions credits that it was not projecting to use for approximately $2.6 million, with no similar income recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The proceeds from this sale were recorded in other income (expense), net in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations as this transaction is not indicative of our normal revenue generating activities.</p>
<p>Finally, on December 14, 2023, the Company entered into an underwriting agreement with BofA Securities, Inc. and Barclays Capital Inc., as representatives of the several underwriters and American Securities LLC ("Selling Stockholder"), pursuant to which the Selling Stockholder agreed to sell 2,500,000 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $25.10 per share ("Offering"). The Offering was conducted pursuant to a prospectus supplement, dated December 14, 2023, to the prospectus, dated December 22, 2021, included in the Company's registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-261858) that was initially filed with the SEC on December 23, 2021.</p>
<p>The Offering closed on December 19, 2023. Although the Company did not sell any shares or receive any proceeds from the Offering, it was required to pay certain expenses in connection with the transaction that totaled approximately $1.2 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. There was no similar expense recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2025,</p>
<p>Income taxes . Income tax expense was $8.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to $8.4 million for the same period in fiscal 2024.</p>
<p>The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 28, 2024 was 24.4% and differed from the statutory federal income tax rate of 21%. The increase was primarily due to the impacts from state taxes and certain permanent items on the federal rate, which were partially offset by the impacts from federal and state tax credits (net of valuation allowances) and discrete period items during the quarter.</p>
<p>The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 30, 2023 was 25.9% and differed from the statutory federal income tax rate of 21%. The increase was primarily due to the impacts from state taxes and certain permanent items on the federal rate, which were partially offset by the impacts from federal and state tax credits (net of valuation allowances) and discrete period items during the quarter.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA . Adjusted EBITDA was $45.8 million, or 14.6% of net sales, for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, a decrease of $1.9 million, or 3.9%, compared to $47.6 million, or 15.0% of net sales, for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease primarily relates to the $4.9 million decrease in operating profit as a result of the factors discussed above, which was partially offset by the $2.9 million of other income, net recorded during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 discussed above.</p>

<h2>Liquidity and Capital Resources</h2>
<p>The Company's primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from its operations, available cash and cash equivalents and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. At December 28, 2024, the Company had $136.1 million of available cash (net of outstanding checks) and $143.3 million of additional borrowings available under the revolving line of credit portion of its credit facility. The Company's revolving line of credit is available for working capital requirements, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.</p>
<h2>Credit Agreement</h2>
<p>On November 17, 2023 (the "Closing Date"), Blue Bird Body Company ("Borrower"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Blue Bird Corporation, executed a $250.0 million five-year credit agreement with Bank of Montreal, acting as administrative agent and an issuing bank; several joint lead arranger partners and issuing banks, including Bank of America; and a syndicate of other lenders (the "Credit Agreement").</p>
<p>The credit facilities provided for under the Credit Agreement consist of a term loan facility in an aggregate initial principal amount of $100.0 million (the "Term Loan Facility") and a revolving credit facility with aggregate commitments of $150.0 million. The revolving credit facility includes a $25.0 million letter of credit sub-facility and $5.0 million swingline sub-facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility," and together with the Term Loan Facility, each a "Credit Facility" and collectively, the "Credit Facilities").</p>
<p>A minimum of $100.0 million of additional term loans and/or revolving credit commitments may be incurred under the Credit Agreement, subject to certain limitations as set forth in the Credit Agreement, and which additional loans and/or commitments would require further commitments from existing lenders or from new lenders.</p>
<p>Borrower has the right to prepay the loans outstanding under the Credit Facilities without premium or penalty (subject to customary breakage costs, if applicable). Additionally, proceeds from asset sales, condemnation, casualty insurance and/or debt issuances (in certain circumstances) are required to be used to prepay borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facilities. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, which were made at the Closing Date, may not be reborrowed once they are repaid while borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility may be repaid and reborrowed from time to time at our election.</p>
<p>The Term Loan Facility is subject to amortization of principal, payable in equal quarterly installments on the last day of each fiscal quarter, which commenced on March 30, 2024, with 5.0% of the $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of all initial term loans outstanding at the Closing Date payable each year prior to the maturity date of the Term Loan Facility. The remaining initial</p>
<p>aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Term Loan Facility, as well as any outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, will be payable on the November 17, 2028 maturity date of the Credit Agreement.</p>
<p>The Credit Facilities are guaranteed by all of the Company's wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries (subject to customary exceptions) and are secured by a security agreement which pledges a lien on virtually all of the assets of Borrower, the Company and the Company's other wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries, other than any owned or leased real property and subject to customary exceptions.</p>
<p>The $100.0 million of Term Loan Facility proceeds and $36.2 million of Revolving Credit Facility proceeds that were borrowed on the Closing Date were used to pay (i) the $131.8 million of term loan indebtedness outstanding under the previous credit agreement ("Amended Credit Agreement"), (ii) interest and commitment fees accrued under the Amended Credit Agreement through the Closing Date and (iii) transaction costs associated with the consummation of the Credit Agreement.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, Borrower, the Company and the Company's other wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default for facilities of this type (with customary grace periods, as applicable, and lender remedies).</p>
<p>Borrowings under the Credit Facilities bear interest, at our option, at (i) base rate ("ABR") or (ii) the Secured Overnight Financing Rate as administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ("SOFR") plus 0.10%, plus an applicable margin depending on the TNLR (which is defined in the Credit Agreement as the ratio of consolidated net debt to consolidated EBITDA on a trailing four quarter basis) of the Company as follows:</p>

<p>Pricing on the Closing Date was set at Level III until receipt of the financial information and related compliance certificate for the first fiscal quarter ending after the Closing Date, with pricing as of December 28, 2024 set at Level I.</p>
<p>Borrower is also required to pay lenders an unused commitment fee of between 0.25% and 0.45% per annum on the undrawn commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility, depending on the TNLR, quarterly in arrears.</p>
<p>The Credit Agreement also includes a requirement that the Company comply with the following financial covenants on the last day of each fiscal quarter through maturity: (i) a pro forma TNLR of not greater than 3.00:1.00 and (ii) a pro forma fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not less than 1.20:1.00.</p>
<p>Detailed descriptions of the Amended Credit Agreement are set forth under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources" contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024, filed with the SEC on November 25, 2024.</p>
<p>At December 28, 2024, Borrower and the guarantors under the Credit Agreement were in compliance with all covenants.</p>
<h2>Short-Term and Long-Term Liquidity Requirements</h2>
<p>Our ability to make principal and interest payments on borrowings under our Credit Facilities, as applicable, and our ability to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future, which, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other conditions. Based on the current level of operations, we believe that our existing cash balances and expected cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next 12 months.</p>
<p>To increase our liquidity in future periods, we could pursue raising additional capital via an equity or debt offering utilizing a currently effective "shelf" registration statement. However, we can offer no assurance that we would be successful in raising this additional capital, which could also lead to increased expense and larger upfront fees when compared with our historical financial statements.</p>
<h2>Seasonality</h2>
<p>Historically, our business has been highly seasonal with school districts buying their new school buses so that they will be available for use on the first day of the school year, typically in mid-August to early September. This has, in fiscal years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in our third and fourth fiscal quarters representing our two busiest quarters from a sales and production perspective,</p>
<p>the latter ending on the Saturday closest to September 30. Our quarterly results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity have historically been, and are likely to be in future periods, impacted by seasonal patterns. Working capital has historically been a significant use of cash during the first fiscal quarter due to planned shutdowns and a significant source of cash generation in the fourth fiscal quarter. With the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent supply chain constraints, seasonality and working capital trends have become unpredictable. Seasonality and variations from historical seasonality have impacted the comparison of working capital and liquidity results between fiscal periods.</p>

<h2>Total cash provided by operating activities</h2>
<p>Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $26.4 million for the three months ended December 28, 2024, an increase of $26.2 million from the $0.2 million of cash flows provided by operating activities during the three months ended December 30, 2023.</p>
<p>The increase primarily resulted from the effect of net changes in operating assets and liabilities that positively impacted operating cash flows by $30.7 million during the three months ended December 28, 2024 when compared with the three months ended December 30, 2023. The primary drivers in this category were favorable changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable of $43.6 million and $17.6 million, respectively, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>· A shift in our customer mix resulted in an increase in the accounts receivable balance at the end of fiscal 2024 when compared with the end of fiscal 2023. Specifically, we had a significant increase in fleet revenue towards the end of fiscal 2024 relating to school buses that were delivered to coincide with the start of the new school year, with such revenue representing the majority of sales we make on credit. During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the accounts receivable balances relating to fiscal 2024 fleet revenue were collected, representing a significant cash inflow (a large source of cash). There was no similar activity during the first quarter of fiscal 2024.</li>
<li>· During fiscal 2023, inflationary pressures and supply chain disruptions significantly increased our purchase costs for components and freight, which, when coupled with increased production and sales volumes during the fiscal year, resulted in a significant increase in the accounts payable balance at the end of fiscal 2023. Although inflationary pressures continued during the first quarter of fiscal 2024, they were smaller when compared to fiscal 2023. This factor, when coupled with our production and sales volumes largely stabilizing during the period, resulted in a significant decrease in the accounts payable balance as of December 30, 2023 when compared with the end of fiscal 2023 (a large use of cash). Although inflationary pressures continued into the first quarter of fiscal 2025, they were relatively small when compared to fiscal 2024. This factor, when coupled with our production and sales volumes remaining relatively consistent in the first quarters of fiscal 2025 and 2024, resulted in a small decrease in the accounts payable balance as of December 28, 2024 when compared with the end of fiscal 2024, representing a significantly smaller use of cash when compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2024.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above favorable changes were partially offset by unfavorable changes in inventory and other assets of $28.2 million and $6.1 million, respectively, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>· We had a large increase in the balance of our inventory during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 when compared with the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (an increase in the use of cash). Specifically, the bus orders that we produced during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 contained a higher mix of units for certain customers, primarily fleet and specific governmental customers, for which the sales cycle is longer when compared with sales to dealers, resulting in a significant increase in units in finished goods inventory as of December 28, 2024 when compared with December 30, 2023. Additionally, at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we elected to strategically acquire larger quantities of certain critical components that have longer lead times and could impact our production schedule in future periods if not manufactured by our suppliers and delivered to us in a timely manner, with no similar activity in the first quarter of fiscal 2024. This purchasing activity resulted in a large increase in our</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>raw materials inventory as of December 28, 2024 when compared with December 30, 2023. There was not a corresponding increase in accounts payable for this activity in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as we had not received the inventory as of the end of the quarter as our manufacturing and supply chain operations were closed for planned maintenance the last week in December, so we recorded the obligation relating to the purchase of this inventory within accrued expenses. Additionally, there was not a corresponding large increase in accrued expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 as the increase for the strategic acquisition of inventory discussed above was largely offset by other activity, including a decrease in the balance of bonuses accrued as of the end of fiscal 2024 that were paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.</p>
</li>
<li>· The changes in other assets were primarily driven by larger increases in certain prepaid assets (a use of cash), including prepaid software contracts and insurance premiums, in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2024 given the continued increases in the costs of these services.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Total cash used in investing activities</h2>
<p>Cash flows used in investing activities totaled $5.1 million for the three months ended December 28, 2024 as compared to $2.9 million for the three months ended December 30, 2023. The $2.2 million increase was primarily due to an increase in spending on fixed assets, as increasing recent profitability has allowed for more capital spending.</p>
<h2>Total cash (used in) provided by financing activities</h2>
<p>Cash flows used in financing activities totaled $12.9 million for the three months ended December 28, 2024 as compared to $1.0 million provided by financing activities for the three months ended December 30, 2023. The $13.9 million decrease between fiscal periods was primarily attributable to $10.0 million in purchases of Company stock in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, with no similar activity in the same period in fiscal 2024. Additionally, as a result of executing the Credit Agreement in the three months ended December 30, 2023 with no similar activity in three months ended December 28, 2024, there was a $5.7 million net decrease in proceeds from borrowings under the Credit Agreement, which was partially reduced by the $3.1 million of costs we incurred in completing the debt refinancing in the first quarter of fiscal 2024.</p>
<h2>Free cash flow</h2>
<p>Management believes the non-GAAP measurement of Free Cash Flow, defined as net cash provided by operating activities less cash paid for fixed assets and acquired intangible assets, fairly represents the Company's ability to generate surplus cash that could fund activities not in the ordinary course of business. See "Key Non-GAAP Financial Measures We Use to Evaluate Our Performance" for further discussion. The following table sets forth the calculation of Free Cash Flow for the periods presented:</p>

</table>
<p>Free Cash Flow for the three months ended December 28, 2024 was $24.5 million higher than for the three months ended December 30, 2023 due to a $26.2 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities and a $1.7 million increase in cash paid for fixed assets, both as discussed above.</p>
<h2>Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements</h2>
<p>We had outstanding letters of credit totaling $6.7 million at December 28, 2024, the majority of which secure our self-insured workers compensation program, the collateral for which is regulated by the State of Georgia.</p>
<h2>Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Mar ket Risk.</h2>
<p>There have not been any material changes to our interest rate, commodity or currency risks previously disclosed in Part II, Item 7A of the Company's fiscal 2024 Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Item 4. Controls and Procedures.</h2>
<h2>Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures</h2>
<p>The Company maintains a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in its reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including, as appropriate, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.</p>
<p>Based on their evaluations, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 28, 2024.</p>
<h2>Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting</h2>
<p>There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended December 28, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<h2>PART II - OTHER INFORMATION</h2>
<h2>Items required under Part II not specifically shown below are not applicable.</h2>
<h2>Item 1. Legal Proceedings.</h2>
<p>Blue Bird is engaged in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of its business. Although no assurances can be given about the final outcome of pending legal proceedings, at the present time management does not believe that the resolution or outcome of any of Blue Bird's pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.</p>
<h2>Item 1A. Risk Factors.</h2>
<p>In addition to the other information set forth in this Report, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's fiscal 2024 Form 10-K. Such risk factors are expressly incorporated herein by reference and they, and the risk factors included below, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or operating results.</p>
<h2>Our costs to produce, and our ability to sell, our products may be negatively impacted by changes in trade policies and tariffs</h2>
<p>Recently proposed trade policies and tariffs could increase the cost of components we and/or our suppliers purchase from Canada, China and Mexico, which would increase our cost to produce buses and purchase parts for resale. These discussed trade policies and tariffs could expand to other foreign countries in future periods. We can provide no assurance that we would be able to successfully pass along part or all of our increased costs to our customers, particularly for those customers for which we have executed a contract containing a fixed bus price. Additionally, our ability to increase the sales price we charge for our products could impact customer buying decisions in future periods, resulting in them buying less, or none, of our products. We can provide no assurance that our ability to sell our products at reasonable margins, or at all, would not be impaired by the imposition of changes in trade policies and tariffs that may make it more difficult or expensive for us to purchase inventory, which could result in reduced sales, profitability and cash flows.</p>
<h2>Changes in laws, regulations or governmental policies and programs involving grants, subsidies and/or other incentives may negatively impact our sale of alternative powered school buses</h2>
<p>Our production plans and financial projections incorporate federal and state programs supporting adoption of clean fuel technologies into existing school bus fleets by offering grants, subsidies and/or other incentives to partially, or fully, offset the higher price of alternative powered school buses. Changes in government programs and support for these products could impact customer buying decisions in future periods, resulting in them buying less, or none, of our alternative powered products. While we manage our product development and production operations to support all power options we offer to our customers, which include diesel, gasoline, propane and allelectric powered school buses, our materials ordering and sales projections incorporate assumptions that the mix of school buses we will produce and sell in future periods will be impacted by customers taking advantage of assistance programs offered by federal and state governments. Changes in such programs could impact customer ordering practices, which could result in sales and/or gross profit amounts varying, potentially significantly, from our original estimates of such amounts.</p>
<p>The risks described in the fiscal 2024 Form 10-K and above are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and/or operating results.</p>
<h2>Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.</h2>
<h2>Issuer Repurchase of Equity Securities</h2>
<p>On January 31, 2024, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized and approved a share repurchase program for up to $60 million of outstanding shares of the Company's common stock over a period of 24 months, expiring January 31, 2026. Under the share repurchase program, the Company may repurchase shares through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase transactions, block purchases or otherwise in accordance with applicable federal securities laws, including Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors also authorized the Company to enter into written trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Adopting a trading plan that satisfies the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 allows a company to repurchase its shares at times when it might otherwise be prevented from doing so due to self-imposed trading blackout periods or</p>
<p>pursuant to insider trading laws. The Company may from time to time enter into Rule 10b5-1 trading plans to facilitate the repurchase of its common stock pursuant to its share repurchase program.</p>
<p>The timing, manner, price, and number of shares to be repurchased will be at the discretion of Company management. The repurchase program does not obligate Blue Bird to acquire any specific amount of securities and can be modified or terminated at any time without notice. Repurchases under this program are expected to be funded from one or a combination of existing cash balances, future free cash flow, or indebtedness.</p>
