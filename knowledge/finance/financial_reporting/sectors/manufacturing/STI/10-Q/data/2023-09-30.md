<h2>NUBIA BRAND INTERNATIONAL CORP.</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<h2>NOTE 1 - DESCRIPTION OF ORGANIZATION, BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND GOING CONCERN</h2>
<p>Nubia Brand International Corp. was incorporated in Delaware on June 14, 2021 andNubia Merger Sub, Inc., an Ohio corporation, (collectively, the Company") The Company was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the "Business Combination"). The Company is not limited to a particular industry or sector for purposes of consummating a Business Combination. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies.</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2023, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from June 14, 2021 (inception) through September 30, 2023 relates to the Company's formation and the initial public offering ("Initial Public Offering" or "IPO"), which is described below. The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering. The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end.</p>
<p>On February 16, 2023, the Company entered into a Merger Agreement (the "Merger Agreement") by and among Honeycomb Battery Company, an Ohio corporation (the "Honeycomb"), the Company, and Nubia Merger Sub, Inc., an Ohio corporation ("Merger Sub") and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into Honeycomb (the "Merger") with Honeycomb as the surviving corporation of the Merger and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. In connection with the Merger, the Company will change its name to "Honeycomb Battery Company" or such other name designated by Honeycomb by notice to the Company, which is referred to herein as the "Combined Company." The board of directors of the Company (the "Nubia Board") has unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby (collectively, the "Transactions") and (ii) resolved to recommend approval of the Merger Agreement and related matters by the stockholders of the Company.</p>
<p>The Merger Agreement provides that the Company will issue to the Honeycomb shareholders aggregate consideration of 70,000,000 shares of the Combined Company's common stock (the "Closing Merger Consideration Shares") at the effective time of the Merger Agreement (the "Effective Time"), plus up to an additional 22,500,000 shares of the Combined Company's common stock (the "Earnout Shares") upon the occurrence of the following events (or earlier upon a change of control of the Combined Company but subject to (and only to the extent that) the valuation of the Combined Company's common stock implied by such change of control transaction meeting the respective volume weighted average price ("VWAP"), as defined in the Merger Agreement, thresholds set forth below):</p>
<ul>
<li>(i) 5,000,000 Earnout Shares if, over any ten (10) trading days within any thirty (30) trading day period from and after the date that is thirty (30) days following the closing date of the Transactions (the "Closing Date") until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, the VWAP of the shares of the Combined Company's Class A common stock is greater than or equal to $12.50 per share (subject to any adjustment pursuant to the Merger Agreement);</li>
<li>(ii) 7,500,000 Earnout Shares if, over any ten (10) trading days within any thirty (30) trading day period from and after the date that is one hundred eighty (180) days following the Closing Date until the date that is forty-two (42) months following the Closing Date, the VWAP of the shares of Combined Company's Class A common stock is greater than or equal to $15.00 per share (subject to any adjustment pursuant to the Merger Agreement); and</li>
<li>(iii) 10,000,000 Earnout Shares if over any ten (10) trading days within any thirty (30) trading day period from and after the date that is one hundred eighty (180) days following the Closing Date until the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, the VWAP of the shares of Combined Company's Class A common stock is greater than or equal to $25.00 per share (subject to any adjustment pursuant to the Merger Agreement).</li>
</ul>
<p>The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of the parties.</p>
<p>The Merger is expected to be accounted for as a reverse recapitalization with Honeycomb as the accounting acquirer.</p>
<p>The registration statement for the Company's Initial Public Offering was declared effective on March 10, 2022. On March 15, 2022, the Company consummated the Initial Public Offering of 11,000,000 units ("Units" and, with respect to the shares of common stock included in the Units being offered, the "Public Shares"), generating gross proceeds of $110,000,000, which is described in Note 3.</p>
<p>Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the private sale (the "Private Placement") of an aggregate of5,000,000 warrants (the "Private Placement Warrants") to Mach FM Acquisitions LLC (the "Sponsor") at a purchase price of $ 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company in the amount of $5,000,000.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>On March 15, 2022, the underwriters purchased an additional1,350,000 Units pursuant to the partial exercise of the over-allotment option. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating additional gross proceeds to the Company of $13,500,000. Also, in connection with the partial exercise of the overallotment option, the Sponsor and the underwriter purchased an additional 405,000 Private Placement Warrants at a purchase price of $1.00 per warrant generating additional gross proceeds to the Company of $405,000.</p>
<p>The Company's ability to commence operations is contingent upon obtaining adequate financial resources through its Initial Public Offering of12,350,000 Units (including a partial exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option) at $10.00 per Unit, which is discussed in Note 3, and the sale of5,405,000 Private Placement Warrants (including a partial exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option) at a price of $ 1.00 per Private Placement Warrant in private placements to the Sponsor that will close simultaneously with the Initial Public Offering.</p>
<p>The Company's management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of Private Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company must complete one or more initial Business Combinations</p>
<p>with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account (as defined below) (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the Trust Account). The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target business sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company Act"). Upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, management agreed that an amount equal to at least $10.20 per Unit sold in the Initial Public Offering, including proceeds of the Private Placement Warrants, will be held in a trust account ("Trust Account"), located in the United States and invested only in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting certain conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds held in the Trust Account, as described below.</p>
<p>The Company will provide the holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the "Public Stockholders") with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer in connection with the Business Combination. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company. The Public Stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially to be $10.20 per Public Share, plus any pro rata interest then in the Trust Account, net of taxes payable). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company's warrants. The Public Shares subject to redemption were recorded at a redemption value and classified as temporary equity upon the completion of the Initial Public Offering in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 480 " Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ."</p>
<p>If the Company seeks stockholder approval of the Business Combination, the Company will proceed with a Business Combination if a majority of the outstanding shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination, or such other vote as required by law or stock exchange rule. If a stockholder vote is not required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the "Certificate of Incorporation"), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each Public Stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares without voting, and if they do vote, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company seeks stockholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Certificate of Incorporation will provide that a Public Stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a "group" (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company.</p>
<p>The holders of the Founder Shares have agreed (a) to waive their redemption rights with respect to the Founder Shares and Public Shares held by them in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (b) not to propose an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of the Company's obligation to allow redemptions in connection with a Business Combination or to redeem 100% of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period (as defined below) or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders' rights or pre-business combination activity, unless the Company provides the Public Stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares in conjunction with any such amendment.</p>
<p>On June 14, 2023, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the "Special Meeting"). At the Special Meeting, stockholders approved to amend the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to allow the Company to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination (the "Extension") on a monthly basis up to six times from June 15, 2023 (the date that is 15 months from the closing date of the Company's initial public offering of units) to December 15, 2023 (the date that is 21 months from the closing date of the IPO).</p>
<p>Stockholders elected to redeem an aggregate 8,430,383 or shares of Common Stock in connection with the Special Meeting. As such, $89,038,493 was withdrawn from the Trust.</p>
<p>In connection with the redemption, the Company recorded an excise tax liability and equity adjustment of $0.9 million. To the extent the Company issues shares during the year ended December 31, 2023, including in connection with the business combination noted above, it likely will reduce the excise tax liability.</p>
<p>If the Company does not complete a business combination with Honeycomb or another target business by September 15, 2023 (or up to December 15, 2023 if the Company has extended the deadline for completing the business combination on a monthly basis up to six times by contributing $125,000 per month for each extension to the Company's trust account in accordance with the current certificate of incorporation), the Company must redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a pershare price, payable in cash, equal to the amount then held in the trust account divided by the number of outstanding public shares. The Sponsor and the Insiders have no redemption rights in the event a business combination is not effected in the completion window, and, accordingly, their founder shares will be worthless. Additionally, in the event of such liquidation, there will be no distribution with respect to the Company's outstanding warrants. Accordingly, the warrants will be worthless. On March 13, 2023, in accordance with the current certificate of incorporation, the Company contributed an aggregate of $1,235,000 (or $0.10 per share for each outstanding public share) to the trust account and extended the time to complete a business combination from March 15, 2023 to June 15, 2023. On June 14, 2023, the Company held a special meeting of stockholders (the "Extension Special Meeting"), at which the stockholders approved a proposal to amend our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "First Charter Amendment") to allow the Company to extend the date by which the Company must consummate a business combination from June 15, 2023 (the date that is 15 months from the closing date of the the Company IPO) to December 15, 2023 (the date that is 21 months from the closing date of the the Company IPO) (the "Amended Date") by depositing the lesser of (a) $125,000 and (b) $0.045 per share per month for each one-month extension. the Company's stockholders elected to redeem an aggregate of 8,430,383 public shares, or 68.26% of the outstanding 12,350,000 public shares, in connection with the Extension Special Meeting. The redemption price was approximately $10.56 per share and amounted to a total of $89,038,493. As of June 12, 2023, after giving effect to the redemptions, there was $41,397,501 remaining in the Company's trust account. On June 15, 2023, the Company deposited $125,000 into the trust account to extend the business combination period to July 15, 2023 in accordance with the First Charter Amendment. On July 15, 2023, the Company deposited $125,000 into the trust account to extend the business combination period to August 15, 2023 in accordance with the First Charter Amendment. On August 15, 2023, the Company deposited $ 125,000 into the trust account to extend the business combination period to September 15, 2023 in accordance with the First Charter Amendment. On September 15, 2023, the Company deposited $125,000 into the trust account to extend the business combination period to October 15, 2023 in accordance with the First Charter Amendment. On October 13, 2023, the Company deposited $125,000 into the trust account to extend the business combination period to November 15, 2023 in accordance with the First Charter Amendment.</p>
<p>If the Company has not completed a Business Combination within the specified period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to pay taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholders' rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company's remaining stockholders and the Company's board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company's obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There are no redemption rights or liquidating</p>
<p>distributions with respect to the Company's Units, which will expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>The holders of the Founders Shares have agreed to waive their liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the holders of Founder Shares acquire Public Shares in or after the Initial Public Offering, such Public Shares are entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission (see Note 6) held in the Trust Account in the event the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the other funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00).</p>
<p>In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below (i) $10.20 per Public Share or (ii) such lesser amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.20 per public Share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account and except as to any claims under the Company's indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except for the Company's independent registered accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.</p>
<h2>Going Concern Consideration</h2>
<p>At September 30, 2023, the Company had cash outside of trust of $1,553 and working capital deficit of $4,139,640. Further, the Company has incurred and expects to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans. In connection with the Company's assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-15, "Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern," management has determined that these liquidity risks, as well as liquidation risk through a windup of the business if the Company is unsuccessful in consummating an initial business combination by November 15, 2023 (or December 15, 2023 if the Company deposits an additional $125,000 into the trust account, in accordance with the Company's charter), raises substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the issuance of this filing. The balance sheets do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("US GAAP"), which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern.</p>
<p>8</p>
<h2>Risks and Uncertainties</h2>
<p>The IR Act imposes a 1% excise tax on the fair market value of stock repurchases made by covered corporations after December 31, 2022. The total taxable value of shares repurchased is reduced by the fair market value of and newly issued shares during the taxable year. Redemption rights are ubiquitous to nearly all SPACs. Shareholders have the ability to require the SPAC to repurchase their shares prior to the merger in what is known as a redemption right, essentially getting their money back. The Company recorded an excise tax liability and equity adjustment of $0.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023 in connection with Special Meeting redemptions.</p>
<p>In February 2022, the Russian Federation and Belarus commenced a military action with the country of Ukraine. As a result of this action, various nations, including the United States, have instituted economic sanctions against the Russian Federation and Belarus. Further, the impact of this action, related sanctions on the world economy and the ongoing hostilities in the Middle East are not determinable as of the date of these financial statements. The specific impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows is also not determinable as of the date of these financial statements.</p>
<p>Management is currently evaluating the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Company's financial position, results of its operations, close of the Initial Public Offering and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.</p>
<h2>NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES</h2>
<h2>Basis of Presentation</h2>
<p>The accompanying unaudited financial statements are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (" US GAAP ") and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.</p>
<p>Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP have been condensed. As such, the information included in these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements as of December 31, 2022 filed with the SEC on Form 10-K. In the opinion of the Company's management, these condensed financial statements include all adjustments, which are only of a normal and recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of the Company's financial position as of September 30, 2023 and the Company's results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2023.</p>
<p>The consolidated financial statements include the Company entities. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated for consolidation purposes.</p>
<h2>Emerging Growth Company</h2>
<p>The Company is an "emerging growth company," as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended (the "JOBS Act"), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder</p>
<p>Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company's financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.</p>
<h2>Use of Estimates</h2>
<p>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires the Company's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period.</p>
<p>Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the balance sheet which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates.</p>
<h2>Cash and cash equivalents</h2>
<p>The Company considers all short-term investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.</p>
<h2>Investments held in Trust Account</h2>
<p>At September 30, 2023 and December 2022, the Company had $42.5 million and $127.8 million in investments held in the Trust Account, respectively. The funds held in Trust are invested only in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with a maturity of 185 days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected by the Company meeting certain conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act, as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds held in the Trust Account. All of the Company's investments held in the Trust Account are classified as trading securities. Trading securities are presented on the balance sheet at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Gains and losses resulting from the change in fair value of investments held in Trust Account are included in Income earned on Investments held in Trust Account in the accompanying statements of operations. The estimated fair value of investments held in Trust Account are determined using available market information.</p>
<p>10</p>
<h2>Offering Costs associated with an Initial Public Offering</h2>
<p>The Company complies with the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") ASC 340-10-S99-1 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin ("SAB") Topic 5A, " Expenses of Offering." Offering costs were allocated to the separable financial instruments issued in the Initial Public Offering based on a relative fair value basis, compared to total proceeds received. Upon completion of the Initial Public Offering, offering costs associated with the shares of Class A Common Stock were allocated between temporary equity and the Public Warrants by the relative fair value method. Total offering costs at the close of the Initial Public Offering were $6,951,081. Other costs of $597,334 consisted principally of costs, such as professional, legal and other fees, incurred in connection with preparation for the Initial Public Offering. These offering costs, together with the underwriter fees of $5,557,500 (of which 4,322,500 is deferred until successful initial Business Combination), were allocated between temporary equity in a relative fair value method upon completion of the Initial Public Offering. In addition, the Company recorded the fair value of $776,815 for representative shares issued upon close of the Public Offering as well as the fair value of the remaining over-allotment option of $19,432 as offering costs.</p>
<h2>Class A ordinary shares subject to possible redemption</h2>
<p>The Company accounts for its Class A common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance enumerated in ASC 480 " Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity ". Common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company's control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders' equity (deficit). The Company's Class A common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered by the Company to be outside of the Company's control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the shares of Class A common stock subject to possible redemption in the amount of $42,452,196 and $127,242,983 are presented as temporary equity, outside of the shareholders' equity section of the Company's balance sheets.</p>
<p>The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable Class A common stock to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Immediately upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering, the Company recognized a measurement adjustment from initial book value to redemption amount value. The change in the carrying value of redeemable Class A ordinary shares resulted in charges against additional paidin capital and accumulated deficit of approximately $12.9 million. The valuation of common stock subject to redemption includes the Company's estimate of interest held in the Trust Account that is available for payment of taxes, and excludes dissolution expense of up to $ 100,000 since it is only taken into account in the event of the Company's liquidation.</p>
<p>At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Class A common stock subject to possible redemption reflected in the balance sheet is reconciled in the following table:</p>

<h2>Income Taxes</h2>
<p>The Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes under ASC 740, " Income Taxes ." Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.</p>

<p>Our effective tax rate was446% and 54% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, and49% and 121% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate of 21.0% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, due to changes in the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets and certain nondeductible expenses.</p>
<p>ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation from its position. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception.</p>
<p>While ASC 740 identifies usage of the effective annual tax rate for purposes of an interim provision, it does allow for estimating individual elements in the current period if they are significant unusual or infrequent. Computing the ETR for the Company is complicated due to the potential impact of the Company's change in fair value of warrants for any other change in fair value of a complex financial instrument), the timing of any potential Business Combination expenses and the actual interest income that will be recognized during the year. The Company has taken a position as to the calculation of income tax expenses in the current period based on 740-27025-3 which states, "if an entity is unable to estimate a part of its ordinary income (or loss) or the related tax (or benefit) but is otherwise able to make a reliable estimate, the tax (or benefit) applicable to the item that cannot be estimated shall be reported in the interim period in which the item is reported." The Company believes its calculation to be a reliable estimate and allows it to properly take into account the unusual elements that can impact its annualized book income and its impact on ETR. As such, the Company is computing its taxable income (loss) and associated income tax provision based on actual results through September 30, 2023.</p>
<h2>Net Income (Loss) per Common Stock</h2>
<p>The Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, " Earnings Per Share. " Net income (loss) per share of common stock is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The Company applies the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. The remeasurement adjustment associated with the redeemable shares of Class A Common Stock is excluded from income (loss) per share as the redemption value approximates fair value.</p>
<p>The calculation of diluted income (loss) per share of common stock does not consider the effect of the warrants issued in connection with the (i) Initial Public Offering and (ii) the Private Placement since the exercise of the warrants is contingent upon the occurrence of future events. As of September 30, 2023, the warrants are exercisable to purchase 11,580,000 shares of Class A common stock in the aggregate. As a result, diluted income (loss) per share of common stock is the same as basic income (loss) per common stock for the periods presented. On March 10, 2022, the Company effectuated a 1.1-for-1 share split on the Class B common stock, resulting in an aggregate of 3,162,500 founder shares outstanding (up to412,500 shares of which were subject to forfeiture, of which75,000 were forfeited, resulting in337,500 common stock shares outstanding subsequent to March 10, 2022). Basic net income per share of common stock excludes the 337,500 shares subject to forfeiture from weighted average shares outstanding between January 1, 2022 through March 10, 2022 due to the contingency with forfeiture. Diluted net income per share of common stock weighted average shares outstanding considers the 337,500 shares subject to forfeiture as outstanding during the entire three and nine months ended September 30, 2022.</p>
<p>12</p>

<h2>Concentration of Credit Risk</h2>
<p>Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist of a cash account in a financial institution, which, at times, may exceed the Federal Depository Insurance Coverage of $250,000. The Company has not experienced losses on this account.</p>
<p>13</p>
<h2>Fair Value of Financial Instruments</h2>
<p>Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for sale of an asset or paid to transfer of a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. US GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). See Note 8.</p>
<h2>Convertible Notes</h2>
<p>The Company accounts for convertible notes as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the convertible notes' specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, and FASB ASC 815, "Derivatives and Hedging" ("ASC 815"). The assessment considers whether the conversion feature is freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the convertible notes meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the conversion feature are indexed to the Company's own common shares. The Company has concluded that the convertible notes qualify for equity treatment.</p>
<h2>Warrants</h2>
<p>The Company accounts for warrants as either equity-classified or liability-classified instruments based on an assessment of the warrant's specific terms and applicable authoritative guidance in ASC 480, and FASB ASC 815, "Derivatives and Hedging" ("ASC 815"). The assessment considers whether the warrants are freestanding financial instruments pursuant to ASC 480, meet the definition of a liability pursuant to ASC 480, and whether the warrants meet all of the requirements for equity classification under ASC 815, including whether the warrants are indexed to the Company's own common shares and whether the warrant holders could potentially require "net cash settlement" in a circumstance outside of the Company's control, among other conditions for equity classification. This assessment is conducted at the time warrant issuance and as of each subsequent quarterly period end date while the warrants are outstanding.</p>
<p>For issued or modified warrants that meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital at the time of issuance. For issued or modified warrants that do not meet all of the criteria for equity classification, the warrants are required to be recorded at their initial fair value on the date of issuance, and each balance sheet date thereafter. The Company accounts for outstanding warrants as equity-classified instruments.</p>
<h2>Recent Accounting Standards</h2>
<p>Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.</p>
<h2>NOTE 3 - INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING</h2>
<p>Pursuant to the Initial Public Offering, the Company sold11,000,000 Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one-half of one redeemable warrant ("Public Warrant"). Each whole Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (see Note 7).</p>
<p>On March 15, 2022, the underwriters purchased an additional1,350,000 Units pursuant to the partial exercise of the over-allotment option. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating additional gross proceeds to the Company of $13,500,000.</p>
<h2>NOTE 4 - PRIVATE PLACEMENTS</h2>
<p>The Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 5,000,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds of $5,000,000, from the Company in private placements that occurred simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering. Each Private Placement Warrant is exercisable to purchase one share of Common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment (see Note 7). The proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants were added to the net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering held in the Trust Account. If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds from the sale of the Private Placement Warrants held in the Trust Account will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law) and the Private Placement Warrants will expire worthless. The Private Placement Warrants (including the Common stock issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Warrants) will not be transferable, assignable or saleable until 30 days after the completion of an Initial Business Combination, subject to certain exceptions.</p>
<p>On March 15, 2022, in connection with the exercise of the over-allotment option, the Sponsor and the underwriter purchased an additional405,000 Private Placement Warrants at a purchase price of $1.00 per warrant generating additional gross proceeds to the Company of $405,000.</p>
<h2>NOTE 5 - RELATED PARTIES</h2>
<h2>Founder Shares</h2>
<p>On August 17, 2021, the Sponsor received 2,875,000 of the Company's Class B common stock (the "Founder Shares") for $25,000 paid for Company deferred offering costs. On March 10, 2022, the Company effectuated a 1.1-for-1 share split, resulting in an aggregate of 3,162,500 Founder Shares outstanding (see Note 7). All share</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<p>amounts have been adjusted to reflect the share split. The Founder Shares include an aggregate of up to 412,500 shares subject to forfeiture to the extent that the underwriters' over-allotment is not exercised in full or in part, so that the number of Founder Shares equals, on an as-converted basis, approximately 20% of the Company's issued and outstanding shares of common stock after the Initial Public Offering. During the year ended December 31, 2022, as a result of the partial exercise of the over-allotment option, the remaining 75,000 shares subject to forfeiture expired.</p>
<p>The holders of the Founder Shares have agreed, subject to limited exceptions, not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Founder Shares until the earlier to occur of: (A) one year after the completion of a Business Combination and (B) subsequent to a Business Combination, (x) if the last reported sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $12.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock capitalizations, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing at least 150 days after a Business Combination, or (y) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, capital stock exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of the Public Stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property.</p>
<h2>Promissory Note - Sponsor</h2>
<p>On July 27, 2021, the Sponsor issued an unsecured promissory note to the Company (the "Promissory Note"), pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $300,000. The Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of (i) March 31, 2022 or (ii) the consummation of the Initial Public Offering (the "Original Maturity Date"). On May 20, 2022, the Company and the Sponsor amended and restated the Promissory Note (the "Amended Note") (i) to extend the Original Maturity Date to a new maturity date which shall be upon the earlier of the closing of the Company's initial business combination or the Company's liquidation, and (ii) to permit the holder of the Amended Note, in its sole discretion, to convert any or all of the unpaid principal under the Amended Note into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant, upon consummation of the Company's initial business combination. On May 17, 2023, the Sponsor issued an unsecured promissory note to the Company (the "Note"), pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000. The Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of the closing of the Company's initial business combination or the Company's liquidation, and to permits the holder of the Note, in its sole discretion, to convert any or all of the unpaid principal under the Amended Note into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant, upon consummation of the Company's initial business combination.</p>

<p>15</p>
<h2>General and Administrative Services</h2>
<p>Commencing on the date of the Initial Public Offering, the Company has agreed to pay the Sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support for up to 18 months. Upon completion of the Initial Business Combination or the Company's liquidation, the Company will cease paying these monthly fees. During the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded $30,000 and $30,000 of expenses related to the agreement, respectively.

<h2>Related Party Loans</h2>
<p>In order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or an affiliate of the Sponsor, or certain of the Company's officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required ("Working Capital Loans"). Such Working Capital Loans would be evidenced by promissory notes. The notes may be repaid upon completion of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender's discretion, up to $1,500,000 of the notes may be converted upon completion of a Business Combination into Warrants at a price of $1.00 per Warrant. Such Units would be identical to the Private Placement Warrants. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were no amounts outstanding under the Working Capital Loans.</p>
<h2>NOTE 6 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES</h2>
<h2>Registration Rights</h2>
<p>The holders of the Founder Shares, Private Placement Warrants that may be issued upon conversion of Working Capital Loans (and any shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Private Placement Warrants or warrants issued upon conversion of the Working Capital Loans and upon conversion of the Founder Shares) are entitled to registration rights pursuant to a registration rights agreement to be signed prior to or on the effective date of Initial Public Offering requiring the Company to register such securities for resale (in the case of the Founder Shares, only after conversion to shares of Class A common stock). The holders of these securities are entitled to make up to three demands, excluding short form registration demands, that the Company register such securities. In addition, the holders have certain "piggy-back" registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to completion of a Business Combination and rights to require the Company to register for resale such securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. However, the registration rights agreement provides that the Company will not be required to effect or permit any registration or cause any registration statement to become effective until the securities covered thereby are released from their lock-up restrictions. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.</p>
<h2>Underwriting Agreement</h2>
<p>The Company granted the underwriters a 45-day option from the date of Initial Public Offering to purchase up to1,650,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any, at the Initial Public Offering price less the underwriting discounts and commissions.</p>
<p>The underwriters were paid a cash underwriting discount of $0.10 per Unit, or $1,235,000 upon the closing of the Initial Public Offering. EF Hutton, division of Benchmark Investments, LLC, which is the representative of the underwriters in the Initial Public Offering, also received 123,500 shares of Class A common stock as compensation in connection with the closing of the Initial Public Offering (the "Representative Shares"). In addition, the underwriters are entitled to a deferred fee of $0.35 per Unit, or $4,322,500, which includes the additional deferred fee from the exercise of the over-allotment option. The deferred fee will become payable to the</p>
<p>underwriters from the amounts held in the Trust Account solely in the event that the Company completes a Business Combination, subject to the terms of the underwriting agreement.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>On March 15, 2022, the underwriters purchased an additional1,350,000 Units pursuant to the partial exercise of the over-allotment option. The Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit, generating additional gross proceeds to the Company of $13,500,000. The Company recorded the fair value of the remaining overallotment option of $19,432 as a liability on accordance with ASC 815-50 on March 15, 2022. On April 29, 2022, the remaining over-allotment option expired and the liability was written off to the statements of operations. Upon consummation of the Initial Public Offering, the Company used a modified Black-Scholes model to value the over-allotment option. See Note 8.</p>
<p>The Representative Shares have been deemed compensation by FINRA and are therefore subject to a lock-up for a period of 180 days immediately following the date of the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part pursuant to Rule 5110(e)(1) of the FINRA Manual. Upon close of the Initial Public Offering, the Company recorded additional stock issuance costs of $776,815, the grant date fair value of the shares.</p>
<h2>Promissory note</h2>
<p>On September 29, 2023, the Company issued an unsecured, non-interest bearing promissory note (the " Note ") to Embark Holdings, LLC in the aggregate principal amount of $565,000. The maturity date of the Note shall be upon the closing of a Repayment/Conversion Trigger Event, as such term is defined below, and (ii) the holder of the Note, in its sole discretion, may convert any or all of the unpaid principal under the Note into the shares of the Company's Class A common stock, at a price of $10.00 per share, upon consummation of the Company's initial business combination. "Repayment/Conversion Trigger Event" means:</p>
<ul>
<li>(i) the closing of a merger, consolidation or other business combination pursuant to which the Company acquires an entity for its initial business combination; or</li>
<li>(ii) the liquidation of the Company on or before the expiration of the time permitted for the Company to consummate a business combination under the Company's charter, or such later liquidation date as may be approved by the Company's stockholders, that occurs while the Note is outstanding or any time thereafter prior to the repayment of the Note.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, upon the closing of the Company's initial business combination, the Company shall issue 565,000 shares of Class A common stock to the holder of the Note for no consideration in proportion to the amount drawn down by the Company under the Note.</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there was $565,000 and $0 outstanding under the Promissory Note.</p>
<h2>NOTE 7 - STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT</h2>
<p>Preferred Stock - The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>Class A Common Stock - The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of Class A common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. Holders of Class A common stock are entitled to one vote for each share. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were123,500 shares of Class A common stock issued and outstanding, respectively. In addition, there were 3,919,617 and 12,350,000 shares of Class A common stock in temporary equity on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.</p>
<p>Class B Common Stock - The Company is authorized to issue 10,000,000 shares of Class B common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. Holders of Class B common stock are entitled to one vote for each share. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there were3,087,500 shares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding. At issuance, the Class B common stock included an aggregate of up to 412,500 shares of Class B common stock originally subject to forfeiture to the extent that the underwriters' over-allotment option is not exercised in full or in part so that the number of Founder Shares will equal 20% of the Company's issued and outstanding common stock after the Initial Public Offering. Upon the partial exercise of the over-allotment option, there were 75,000 shares which were forfeited during the year ended December 31, 2022 when the remaining over-allotment option expired.</p>
<p>Only holders of the Class B common stock will have the right to vote on the election of directors prior to the Business Combination. Holders of Class A common stock and holders of Class B common stock will vote together as a single class on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders except as otherwise required by law. In connection with our initial business combination, we may enter into a stockholders agreement or other arrangements with the stockholders of the target or other investors to provide for voting or other corporate governance arrangements that differ from those in effect upon completion of this offering.</p>
<p>The shares of Class B common stock will automatically convert into Class A common stock at the time of a Business Combination, or earlier at the option of the holder, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment. In the case that additional shares of Class A common stock, or equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts issued in the Initial Public Offering and related to the closing of a Business Combination, the ratio at which shares of Class B common stock shall convert into shares of Class A common stock will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common stock agree to waive such adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of all shares of Class B common stock will equal, in the aggregate, on an as converted basis, 20% of the sum of the total number of all shares of common stock outstanding upon the completion of Initial Public Offering plus all shares of Class A common stock and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with a Business Combination (net of the number of shares of Class A common stock redeemed in connection with a Business Combination), excluding any shares or equity-linked securities issued or issuable to any seller of an interest in the target to us in a Business Combination.</p>
<p>Warrants - As of September 30, 2023, there were11,580,000 warrants outstanding (5,405,000 Private warrants and 6,175,000 Public Warrants). Public Warrants may only be exercised for a whole number of shares. No fractional warrants will be issued upon separation of the Units and only whole warrants will trade. The Public Warrants will become exercisable on the later of (a) 30 days after the completion of a Business Combination and (b) 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. The Public Warrants will expire five years after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the issuance of the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants is then effective and a current prospectus relating to those shares of Class A common stock is available, subject to the Company satisfying its obligations with respect to registration, or a valid exemption from registration is available. No warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and the Company will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of residence of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration is available.</p>
<p>The Company has agreed that as soon as practicable after the closing of a Business Combination the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to file, and within 90 days following a Business Combination to have declared effective, a registration statement covering the issuance of the shares of Class A common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and to maintain a current prospectus relating to those shares of Class A common stock until the warrants expire or are redeemed. Notwithstanding the above, if the Class A common stock is at the time of any exercise of a warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a "covered security" under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act, the Company may, at its option, require holders of Public Warrants who exercise their warrants to do so on a "cashless basis" in accordance with Section 3(a) (9) of the Securities Act and, in the event the Company so elects, the Company will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement, but will use its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available.</p>
<p>Redemption of Warrants When the Price per Share of Class A Common Stock Equals or Exceeds $ 18.00 - Once the warrants become exercisable, the Company may redeem the outstanding Public Warrants:</p>
<ul>
<li>● in whole and not in part;</li>
<li>● at a price of $0.01 per Public Warrant;</li>
<li>● upon a minimum of 30 days' prior written notice of redemption, or the 30-day redemption period to each warrant holder; and</li>
<li>● if, and only if, the last reported sale price of the Class A common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganization, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the Company sends the notice of redemption to warrant holders.</li>
</ul>
<p>If and when the warrants become redeemable by the Company, the Company may exercise its redemption right even if it is unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws.</p>
<p>If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, as described above, its management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a "cashless basis," as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, extraordinary dividend or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, except as described below, the Public Warrants will not be adjusted for issuances of common stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the Public Warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of Public Warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their Public Warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company's assets held outside of the Trust Account with respect to such Public Warrants. Accordingly, the Public Warrants may expire worthless.</p>
<p>The Private Placement Warrants are identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units being sold in the Initial Public Offering.</p>
<h2>NOTE 8 - FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS</h2>
<p>The Company follows the guidance in ASC 820 for its financial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period and nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are re-measured and reported at fair value at least annually.</p>
<p>The fair value of the Company's financial assets and liabilities reflects management's estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities). The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities:</p>
<p>Level 1 -quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>Level 2 -observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.</p>
<p>Level 3 -unobservable inputs based on our assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.</p>
<p>The following table presents information about the Company's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at June 30, 2023, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation inputs the Company utilized to determine such fair value:</p>

<h2>ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</h2>
<p>The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the notes related thereto which are included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain information contained in the discussion and analysis set forth below includes forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of many factors, including those set forth under "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the "Initial Business Combination").</p>
<p>We intend to effectuate an Initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of our initial public offering (the "Public Offering") that closed on March 15, 2022 (the "Closing Date") and the private placement warrants sold in a private placement (the "Private Placement Warrants") that closed on the Closing Date and from additional issuances, if any, of, our capital stock and our debt, or a combination of cash, stock and debt.</p>
<p>Our business activities from inception to September 30, 2023 consisted primarily of our preparation for our Public Offering that was completed on March 15, 2022 and, since the Closing Date, identification and evaluation of prospective acquisition targets for an Initial Business Combination.</p>
<p>On February 16, 2023, we entered into a Merger Agreement (the "Merger Agreement") by and among Honeycomb Battery Company, an Ohio corporation ("Honeycomb"), we, and Nubia Merger Sub, Inc., an Ohio corporation ("Merger Sub") and our wholly-owned subsidiary, pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into Honeycomb (the "Merger") with Honeycomb as the surviving corporation of the Merger and becoming our wholly-owned subsidiary. In connection with the Merger, we will change its name to "Honeycomb Battery Company" or such other name designated by Honeycomb by notice to us, which is referred to herein as the "Combined Company." Our board of directors has unanimously (i) approved and declared advisable the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated thereby (collectively, the "Transactions") and (ii) resolved to recommend approval of the Merger Agreement and related matters by our stockholders.</p>
<p>The Merger Agreement provides that we will issue to the Honeycomb shareholders aggregate consideration of 70,000,000 shares of the Combined Company's common stock (the "Closing Merger Consideration Shares") at the effective time of the Merger Agreement (the "Effective Time"), plus up to an additional 22,500,000 shares of the Combined Company's common stock (the "Earnout Shares") upon the occurrence of the following events (or earlier upon a change of control of the Combined Company but subject to (and only to the extent that) the valuation of the Combined Company's common stock implied by such change of control transaction meeting the respective VWAP (as defined below) thresholds set forth below):</p>
<ul>
<li>(i) 5,000,000 Earnout Shares if, over any ten (10) trading days within any thirty (30) trading day period from and after the date that is thirty (30) days following the closing date of the Transactions (the "Closing Date") until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, the VWAP of the shares of the Combined Company's Class A common stock is greater than or equal to $12.50 per share (subject to any adjustment pursuant to the Merger Agreement);</li>
<li>(ii) 7,500,000 Earnout Shares if, over any ten (10) trading days within any thirty (30) trading day period from and after the date that is one hundred eighty (180) days following the Closing Date until the date that is forty-two (42) months following the Closing Date, the VWAP of the shares of Combined Company's Class A common stock is greater than or equal to $15.00 per share (subject to any adjustment pursuant to the Merger Agreement); and</li>
<li>(iii) 10,000,000 Earnout Shares if over any ten (10) trading days within any thirty (30) trading day period from and after the date that is one hundred eighty (180) days following the Closing Date until the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date, the VWAP of the shares of Combined Company's Class A common stock is greater than or equal to $25.00 per share (subject to any adjustment pursuant to the Merger Agreement).</li>
</ul>
<p>For purposes of the foregoing, "VWAP" means, for any security as of any date(s), the dollar volume-weighted average price for such security on the principal securities exchange or securities market on which such security is then traded during the period beginning at 9:30:01 a.m., New York time, and ending at 4:00:00 p.m., New York time, as reported by Bloomberg through its "HP" function (set to weighted average) or, if the foregoing does not apply, the dollar volume-weighted average price of such security in the over-the-counter market on the electronic bulletin board for such security during the period beginning at 9:30:01 a.m., New York time, and ending at 4:00:00 p.m., New York time, as reported by Bloomberg, or, if no dollar volume-weighted average price is reported for such security by Bloomberg for such hours, the average of the highest closing bid price and the lowest closing ask price of any of the market makers for such security as reported by OTC Markets Group Inc. If the VWAP cannot be calculated for such security on such date(s) on any of the foregoing bases, the VWAP of such security on such date(s) shall be the fair market value per share on such date(s) as reasonably determined by us.</p>
<p>In accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, each share of Honeycomb's common stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive its allocable portion of the Closing Merger Consideration Shares and the Earnout Shares, if any.</p>
<p>The Business Combination will require the approval of our shareholders and the shareholders of Honeycomb and is subject to other customary closing conditions, including a proxy statement being filed with and cleared by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Transactions is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2023.</p>
<p>At September 30, 2023, we had cash of $1,553 and working capital deficit of $4,139,640. Further, we expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans. We cannot assure you that our plans to complete an Initial Business Combination will be successful.</p>

<h2>Going Concern Considerations, Liquidity and Capital Resources</h2>
<p>On March 15, 2022, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 11,000,000 Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit, which includes the exercise by the underwriters of the over-allotment option to purchase an additional 1,350,000 Units, generating gross proceeds of $123,500,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering and exercise of the over-allotment option, we consummated the sale of 5,405,000 Private Placement Warrants at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to our Sponsor, generating gross proceeds of $5,405,000.</p>
<p>Following the Initial Public Offering, the exercise of the over-allotment option by the underwriters' and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants, a total of $125,970,000 was placed in the Trust Account and as of September 30, 2023, we had $1,553 of cash held outside of the Trust Account, after payment of costs related to the Initial Public Offering, and available for working capital purposes. Transaction costs amounted to $6,951,081 consisting of $1,235,000 of underwriting fees, $4,322,500 of deferred underwriting fees payable and $597,334 of other offering costs. In addition, the Company recorded the fair value of $776,815 for representative shares issued upon close of the Public Offering as well as the fair value of the remaining over-allotment option of $19,432 as offering costs.</p>
<p>For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used in operating activities was $2,144,959, which consisted of net income of $582,121, interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $3,351,292, and changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $624,212 of cash from operating activities.</p>
<p>For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash provided by investing activities was $88,639,691, primarily related to inflow of funds from the Trust account related to redemptions.</p>
<p>For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, cash used by financing activities was $87,038,834, primarily related to redemptions, partially offset by proceeds from notes.</p>
<p>For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, cash used in operating activities was $696,397 which consisted of a net loss of $21,849, interest earned on marketable securities held in the Trust Account of $747,311, the gain on the change in fair value of the over-allotment liability of $19,432 and changes in operating assets and liabilities provided $92,195 of cash from operating activities.</p>
<p>For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, the Company used cash of $125,970,000 in investing activities for the purchase of investments in the Trust Account following the Initial Public Offering, the exercise of the over-allotment option by the underwriters' and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants.</p>
<p>For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, cash from financing activities provided $127,240,757. The Company received gross proceeds of $128,905,000 from the Initial Public Offering, the exercise of the over-allotment option by the underwriters' and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants. These increases were offset by payment of the underwriting fees and offering costs of $1,235,000 and $429,243, respectively.</p>
<p>As of September 30, 2023, we had investments held in the Trust Account of $42,494,483 principally invested in U.S. government securities. Interest income on the balance in the Trust Account may be used by us to pay taxes, and to pay up to $100,000 of any dissolution expenses.</p>
<p>At September 30, 2023, the Company had cash outside of trust of $1,553 and working capital deficit of $4,139,640. Further, the Company has incurred and expects to</p>
<p>continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of its financing and acquisition plans. In connection with the Company's assessment of going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-15, "Disclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern," management has determined that these liquidity risks, as well as liquidation risk through a windup of the business if the Company is unsuccessful in consummating an initial business combination by November 15, 2023 (or December 15, 2023 if the Company deposits an additional $125,000 into the trust account, in accordance with the Company's charter), raises substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the issuance of this filing. The balance sheets do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("US GAAP"), which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>We intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the Trust Account, including any amounts representing interest earned on the Trust Account, excluding the deferred underwriting commissions, to complete an initial business combination. To the extent that capital stock or debt is used, in whole or in part, as consideration to complete an initial business combination, the remaining proceeds held in the Trust Account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses, make other acquisitions and pursue growth strategies. If an initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the Trust Account to pay the purchase price or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the Trust Account to meet such requirements or arrange for third-party financing.</p>
<p>We completed the sale of 12,350,000 units (the "Public Units") at an offering price of $10.00 per unit in the Public Offering including 1,350,000 units at the initial public offering price less the underwriting discounts and commissions pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option. On the Closing Date, simultaneously with the consummation of the Public Offering, the Company consummated the private sale (the "Private Placement") of an aggregate of 5,000,000 warrants (the "Private Placement Warrants") to our Sponsor at a purchase price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating gross proceeds to the Company in the amount of $5,000,000.</p>
<p>Each Public Unit consists of one share of our Class A common stock, $0.0001 par value (each a "Public Share"), and one-half of one redeemable warrant, with each whole warrant exercisable for one share of Class A common stock (each, a "Warrant" and, collectively, the "Warrants"). One Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one whole share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share.</p>
<p>Of the proceeds of the Public Offering and the Private Placement aggregating $128,905,000, $125,970,000 were deposited in a trust account (the "Trust Account"). Income on the funds held in the Trust Account may be released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes.</p>
<p>On July 27, 2021, the Sponsor issued an unsecured promissory note to the Company (the "Promissory Note"), pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $300,000. The Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of (i) March 31, 2022 or (ii) the consummation of the Initial Public Offering (the "Original Maturity Date"). On May 20, 2022, the Company and the Sponsor amended and restated the Promissory Note (the "Amended Note") (i) to extend the Original Maturity Date to a new maturity date which shall be upon the earlier of the closing of the Company's initial business combination or the Company's liquidation, and (ii) to permit the holder of the Amended Note, in its sole discretion, to convert any or all of the unpaid principal under the Amended Note into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant, upon consummation of the Company's initial business combination. On May 17, 2023, the Sponsor issued an unsecured promissory note to the Company (the "Note"), pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000. The Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and payable on the earlier of the closing of the Company's initial business combination or the Company's liquidation, and to permits the holder of the Note, in its sole discretion, to convert any or all of the unpaid principal under the Amended Note into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant, upon consummation of the Company's initial business combination. As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, there was $1,297,500 and $125,341 outstanding under the Promissory Note.</p>
<h2>Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements</h2>
<p>We have no obligations, assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. We do not participate in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating offbalance sheet arrangements.</p>
<p>We have not entered into any off-balance sheet financing arrangements, established any special purpose entities, guaranteed any debt or commitments of other entities, or entered into any non-financial agreements involving assets.</p>
<h2>Contractual Obligations</h2>
<p>At September 30, 2023, we did not have any long-term debt, capital lease obligations, operating lease obligations or long-term liabilities. We entered into an administrative support agreement pursuant to which we have agreed to pay an affiliate of the Sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial, and administrative support services. Upon the earlier of the completion of the Initial Business Combination and the Company's liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement., upon the consummation of our Initial Business Combination, we will pay the underwriters a cash fee in an amount equal to 3.5% of the gross proceeds of the Public Offering (exclusive of any applicable finders' fees which might become payable). No fee will be due if we do not complete an Initial Business Combination.</p>
<p>24</p>
<h2>Critical Accounting Policies</h2>
<p>The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following as our critical accounting policies:</p>
<h2>Net Income (Loss) per Common Share</h2>
<p>The Company complies with accounting and disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 260, " Earnings Per Share. " Net income (loss) per share of common stock is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The Company applies the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. The remeasurement adjustment associated with the redeemable shares of Class A Common Stock is excluded from income (loss) per share as the redemption value approximates fair value.</p>
<p>The calculation of diluted income (loss) per share of common stock does not consider the effect of the warrants issued in connection with the (i) Initial Public Offering</p>
<p>and (ii) the Private Placement. As a result, diluted income (loss) per share of common stock is the same as basic income (loss) per common stock for the periods presented. On March 10, 2022, the Company effectuated a 1.1-for-1 share split, resulting in an aggregate of 3,162,500 founder shares outstanding (up to 412,500 shares of which are subject to forfeiture. All share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect this share split. The weighted average shares excludes an aggregate of up to 75,000 shares of Class B common stock subject to forfeiture if the over-allotment option is not exercised in full by the underwriters. As of September 30, 2023, the warrants are exercisable to purchase 11,580,000 shares of Class A common stock in the aggregate.</p>
<h2>Class A common stock subject to possible redemption</h2>
<p>The Company accounts for its shares of Class A common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance enumerated in ASC 480 "Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity". Common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that feature redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company's control) are classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders' equity. The shares of the Company's Class A common stock feature certain redemption rights that are considered by the Company to be outside of the Company's control and subject to the occurrence of uncertain future events.</p>
<h2>Fair Value of Financial Instruments</h2>
<p>Fair value is defined as the price that would be received for sale of an asset or paid to transfer of a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. US GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).</p>
<p>25</p>
<h2>Derivative Financial Instruments</h2>
<p>The Company evaluates its financial instruments, including the over-allotment option, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives in accordance with ASC Topic 815, " Derivatives and Hedging ". For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value on the grant date and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative liabilities are classified in the condensed balance sheets as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement or conversion of the instrument could be required within 12 months of the balance sheet date.</p>
<h2>Recent Accounting Pronouncements</h2>
<p>Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company's balance sheet.</p>
<h2>Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk</h2>
<p>This item is not applicable as we are a smaller reporting company.</p>
<h2>Item 4. Controls and Procedures</h2>
<p>Disclosure controls and procedures are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.</p>
<h2>Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures</h2>
<p>Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.</p>
<p>Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer have concluded that during the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.</p>
<h2>Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting</h2>
<p>During the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2023, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.</p>
