The terms "may," "should," "could," "anticipate," "believe," "continues," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "objective," "plan," "potential," "project," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. These statements are based on management's current expectations, intentions or beliefs and are subject to a number of factors, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences or that might otherwise impact the business include the risk factors set forth in Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We undertake no obligation to update any such factor or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.</p>
<p>In addition, while we do, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against our policy to disclose to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, stockholders should not assume that we agree with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report. Thus, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not our responsibility.</p>
<h2>ITEM 1. Business</h2>

The Company's strategy is to provide specialized technical expertise and "engineered solutions" based on our core engineering and manufacturing capabilities. The Company provides solutions and adds value through design-in support, systems integration, prototype design and manufacturing, testing, logistics and aftermarket technical service and repair through its global infrastructure.</p>
<p>Our fiscal year 2024 began on May 28, 2023 and ended on June 1, 2024, our fiscal year 2023 began on May 29, 2022 and ended on May 27, 2023 and our fiscal year 2022 began on May 30, 2021 and ended on May 28, 2022. Unless otherwise noted, all references to a particular year in this document shall mean the fiscal year for such period.</p>
<h2>Government Regulations</h2>
<p>We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulatory requirements relating to our operations. These laws and regulations, which differ among jurisdictions, include, among others, those related to financial and other disclosures, accounting standards, privacy and data protection, cybersecurity, intellectual property, corporate governance, tax, trade, antitrust, employment, import/export, anti-corruption, and environmental regulatory compliance. Expenditures relating to such regulations are made in the ordinary course of our business and do not represent material expenditures and we further do not currently expect that compliance with such laws will require us to make material additional expenditures, however, there is no assurance that existing or future laws and regulations applicable to our operations, products, and services will not have a material adverse effect on our business.</p>
<p>Among others, we are subject to a variety of data protection laws that change frequently and have requirements that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. We are subject to significant compliance obligations under privacy laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union and an expanding list of comprehensive state privacy and/or cybersecurity laws in the United States. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations subjects us to potential regulatory enforcement activity, fines, private litigation including class actions, reputational impacts, and other costs. Our efforts to comply with privacy and data security laws and regulations complicate our operations and add to our costs.</p>
<p>We are also subject to various domestic and international export, trade and anti-corruption laws, such as the Arms Export Control Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations ("ITAR"), the Export Administration Regulations ("EAR"), anti-money laundering laws and regulations and the trade and trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the Office of the United States Trade Representative and the United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. Violations of these laws and regulations may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties.</p>
<p>Our operations also are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing health and safety aspects of our operations, or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of remedial or corrective action requirements, and the imposition of injunctions to prohibit certain activities or force future compliance.</p>
<h2>PART I</h2>
<p>Certain of the Company's products are manufactured in China and are imported into the United States. Our importation of products into the United States from China is subject to tariffs instituted and imposed from time to time by The Office of the United States Trade Representative. Management works with suppliers and customers in an effort to mitigate the impact of such tariffs on customer markets. Our sales and gross margins on certain products could be negatively impacted if we are unable to successfully pass through the additional cost of applicable tariffs, or if higher prices reduce demand for the Company's products.</p>
<p>For more information on risks related to the laws and regulations to which we are subject, see the relevant discussions throughout Item 1A, Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Geography</h2>
<p>We currently have operations in the following major geographic regions: North America, Asia/Pacific, Europe and Latin America. Selected financial data attributable to each segment and geographic region for fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 is set forth in Note 10, Segment and Geographic Information , of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>Business Segments</h2>
<p>The Company reports it financial performance on the operating and reportable segments defined as follows:</p>
<p>Power and Microwave Technologies ("PMT") combines our core engineered solutions capabilities, power grid and microwave tube business with new disruptive RF, Wireless and Power technologies. As a designer, manufacturer, technology partner and authorized distributor, PMT's strategy is to provide specialized technical expertise and engineered solutions based on our core engineering and manufacturing capabilities on a global basis. We provide solutions and add value through design-in support, systems integration, prototype design and manufacturing, testing, logistics and aftermarket technical service and repair - all through our existing global infrastructure. PMT's focus is on products for power, RF and microwave applications for customers in 5G, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific and semiconductor markets. PMT focuses on various applications including broadcast transmission, CO2 laser cutting, diagnostic imaging, dielectric and induction heating, high energy transfer, high voltage switching, plasma, power conversion, radar and radiation oncology. PMT also offers its customers technical services for both microwave and industrial equipment.</p>
<p>PMT represents leading manufacturers of electron tubes and RF, Microwave and power components used in semiconductor manufacturing equipment, RF and wireless and industrial power applications. Among the suppliers PMT supports are Amperex, CDE, CPI, Draloric, Eimac, General Electric, Hitachi, Jennings, L3, MACOM, National, NJRC, Ohmite, Qorvo, Thales, Toshiba and Vishay.</p>
<p>PMT's inventory levels reflect our commitment to maintaining an inventory of a broad range of products for customers who are buying products for replacement of components used in critical equipment and designing in new technologies. PMT also sells a number of products representing trailing edge technology. While the market for these trailing edge technology products is declining, PMT is increasing its market share. PMT often buys products it knows it can sell ahead of any supplier price increases and extended lead times. As manufacturers for these products exit the business, PMT has the option to purchase a substantial portion of their remaining inventory.</p>
<p>PMT has distribution agreements with many of its suppliers; most of these agreements provide exclusive distribution rights that often include global coverage. The agreements are typically long term, and usually contain provisions permitting termination by either party if there are significant breaches that are not cured within a reasonable period. Although some of these agreements allow PMT to return inventory periodically, others do not, in which case PMT may have obsolete inventory that they cannot return to the supplier.</p>
<p>PMT's suppliers provide warranty coverage for the products and allow the return of defective products, including those returned to PMT by its customers. For information regarding the warranty reserves, see Note 3, Significant Accounting Policies and Disclosures , of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.</p>
<p>In addition to third party products, we sell proprietary products principally under certain trade names we own including Amperex ®, Cetron ® and National® . Our proprietary products include thyratrons and rectifiers, power tubes, ignitrons, magnetrons, phototubes, microwave generators, Ultracapacitor modules and liquid crystal display monitors. The materials used in the manufacturing process consist of glass bulbs and tubing, nickel, stainless steel and other metals, plastic and metal bases, ceramics and a wide variety of fabricated metal components. These materials are generally readily available, but some components may require long lead times for production, and some materials are subject to shortages or price fluctuations based on supply and demand.</p>
<p>Green Energy Solutions ("GES") combines our key technology partners and engineered solutions capabilities to design and manufacture innovative products for the fast-growing energy storage market and power management applications. As a designer, manufacturer, technology partner and authorized distributor, GES's strategy is to provide specialized technical expertise and engineered solutions using our core design engineering and manufacturing capabilities on a global basis. We provide solutions and add value through design-in support, systems integration, prototype design and manufacturing, testing, logistics and aftermarket technical service and repair - all through our existing global infrastructure. GES's focus is on products for numerous green energy applications such as wind, solar, hydrogen and Electric Vehicles, and other power management applications that support green solutions such as synthetic diamond manufacturing.</p>
<p>Canvys provides customized display solutions serving the corporate enterprise, financial, healthcare, industrial and medical original equipment manufacturers markets. Our engineers design, manufacture, source and support a full spectrum of solutions to match the needs of our customers. We offer long-term availability and proven custom display solutions that include touch screens, protective panels, custom enclosures, All-In-One computers, specialized cabinet finishes and application specific software packages and certification services. We partner with both private label manufacturing companies and leading branded hardware vendors to offer the highest quality display and touch solutions and customized computing platforms.</p>
<p>We have long-standing relationships with key component and finished goods manufacturers and several key ISO 9001 and ISO 13485 certified Asian display manufacturers that manufacture products to our specifications. We believe supplier relationships, combined with our engineering design and manufacturing capabilities and private label partnerships, allow us to maintain a well-balanced and technologically advanced offering of customer specific display solutions.</p>
<p>Healthcare manufactures, repairs, refurbishes and distributes high value replacement parts and equipment for the healthcare market including hospitals, medical centers, asset management companies, independent service organizations and multi-vendor service providers. Products include diagnostic imaging replacement parts for CT and MRI systems; replacement CT and MRI tubes; CT service training; MRI and RF amplifiers; hydrogen thyratrons, klystrons, magnetrons; flat panel detector upgrades; pre-owned CT systems; and additional replacement solutions currently under development for the diagnostic imaging service market. Through a combination of newly developed products and partnerships, service offerings and training programs, we believe we can help our customers improve efficiency while lowering the cost of healthcare delivery.</p>
<h2>Sales and Product Management</h2>
<p>We have employees, as well as authorized representatives who are not our employees, selling our products primarily in regions where we do not have a direct sales presence.</p>
<p>We offer various credit terms to qualifying customers as well as cash in advance and credit card terms. We establish credit limits for each customer and routinely review delinquent and aging accounts.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>We maintain over 100,000 part numbers in our product inventory database and we estimate that more than 90% of orders received by 6:00 p.m. local time are shipped complete the same day for in-stock product. Customers can access our products on our websites, www.rell.com, www.rellhealthcare.com, www.canvys.com, www.rellpower.com, www.relltubes.com and www.rellaser.com, through electronic data interchange, or by telephone. Customer orders are processed by our regional sales offices and supported primarily by one of our distribution facilities in LaFox, Illinois; Fort Mill, South Carolina; Amsterdam, Netherlands; Marlborough, Massachusetts; Donaueschingen, Germany; or Singapore, Singapore. We also have satellite warehouses in Sao Paulo, Brazil; Shanghai, China; Bangkok, Thailand; and Hook, United Kingdom. Our data processing network provides on-line, real-time interconnection of all sales offices and central distribution operations, 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Information on stock availability, pricing in local currency, cross-reference information, customers and market analyses are obtainable throughout the entire distribution network. The content of our websites is not deemed to be incorporated by reference in this report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<h2>International Sales</h2>
<p>During fiscal 2024, we made approximately 60% of our sales outside the United States. We continue to pursue new international sales to further expand our geographic reach.</p>
<h2>Major Customers</h2>
<p>No one customer accounted for more than 10 percent of the Company's consolidated net sales for fiscal 2024. Sales to one customer in our PMT segment totaled $31.2 million, which accounted for 12 percent of the Company's consolidated net sales in fiscal 2023. No one customer accounted for more than 10 percent of the Company's consolidated net sales for fiscal 2022. See Note 10, Segment and Geographic Information , of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.</p>
<h2>Human Capital Resources</h2>
<h2>Recruitment &amp; Staffing</h2>
<p>The future success of our Company depends on our ability to attract, hire, motivate, retain and further develop top talent, including highly skilled technical, management and sales personnel. The skills, experience and industry knowledge of our employees significantly benefit our operations and performance. Competition for such personnel is intense and the salary, benefits and other costs to employ the right personnel may impact our results and performance.</p>
<p>As of June 1, 2024, we employed 442 individuals, 407 of whom were employed on a full-time basis and 35 of whom were employed on a part-time basis. Of these, 284 full-time and 15 part-time employees were located in the United States and 123 full-time and 20 part-time employees were located internationally. All our employees are non-union.</p>
<p>The Company offers employees a competitive compensation program, designed to recognize and reward both individual and company performance through base pay, variable compensation programs, and health, well-being and retirement programs to meet the needs of our employees.</p>
<h2>Diversity, Equity, Inclusion &amp; Belonging ("DEI&amp;B")</h2>
<p>We are an international company with offices and personnel located around the world. We understand, respect, and value the similarities as well as the differences of our employees. Our human capital is a critical asset that enables us to serve and support our global customer base. Our effectiveness in maximizing the talents of people of different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives is key to our continued global success. Fostering, cultivating, and preserving a culture of diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging is a key priority for the Company. We seek to embrace and encourage our employees' differences in age, disability, ethnicity, family or marital status, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, physical and mental ability, political affiliation, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, veteran status, and other characteristics that make our employees unique.</p>
<p>Management has identified DEI&amp;B as a priority for our Company. Significant positive change requires careful planning, leadership, resources, and coordination. The Company established a DEI&amp;B committee to plan and implement changes to achieve our goal of being a more diverse and inclusive organization. The DEI&amp;B committee has been charged with making recommendations about how we, as a company, can promote and act upon the Company's initiatives in this area. The committee will identify priorities based on employee input and incorporate these into the Company's strategic plans, work to establish accountability and methods of measuring our progress and provide appropriate communications about our plans and achievements to our stakeholders. To date, DEI&amp;B initiatives have focused on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>·The election of a female to serve on the Board of Directors</li>
<li>·Increasing DEI&amp;B awareness on a Company-wide basis through education and involvement</li>
<li>·Inclusion of socially responsible funds in our 401K Plan</li>
<li>·Providing regular training, communication, activities, and surveys regarding DEI&amp;B matters to our employees</li>
</ul>

<h2>ITEM 1A. Risk Factors</h2>
<p>Investors should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included and incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K that we believe are applicable to our businesses and the industries in which we operate. While we believe we have identified the key risk factors affecting our businesses, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our results of operations.</p>
<h2>Business and Operational Risks</h2>
<h2>We may not achieve our plan for sales growth and margin targets.</h2>
<p>We have established both margin and expense targets to grow our sales with new and existing customers. If we do not achieve our growth objectives, the complexity of our global infrastructure makes it difficult to leverage our fixed cost structure to align with the size of our operations. Factors that could have a significant effect on our ability to achieve these goals include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>·Failure to achieve our sales and margin growth objectives in our product lines and business units;</li>
<li>·Failure to implement or properly execute our growth strategies, including failures to identify, consummate and successfully integrate acquisitions and/or other opportunities to diversify, extend and expand our business;</li>
<li>·Declining gross margin reflecting competitive pricing pressures or product mix; and</li>
<li>·Limitations on our ability to leverage our support-function cost structure while maintaining an adequate structure to achieve our growth objectives.</li>
</ul>
<h2>We have historically incurred significant charges for inventory obsolescence and may incur similar charges in the future.</h2>
<p>We maintain significant inventories in an effort to ensure that customers have a reliable source of supply. Our products generally support industrial machinery powered by tube technology. As technology evolves and companies replace their capital equipment, the market for our products potentially declines. In addition, the market for many of our other products changes rapidly resulting from the development of new technologies, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions by some of our suppliers and changing end-user demand, which can contribute to the decline in value or obsolescence of our inventory. We do not have many long-term supply contracts with our customers. If we fail to anticipate the changing needs of our customers or we do not accurately forecast customer demand, our customers may not place orders with us, and we may accumulate significant inventories of products that we may be unable to sell or return to our vendors. This may result in a decline in the value of our inventory.</p>
<h2>We face competitive pressures that could have a material adverse effect on our business.</h2>
<p>Our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including price, engineering capability, vendor representation, product diversity, lead times and the level of customer service. There are very few vacuum tube competitors in the markets we serve. There are also a limited number of Chinese manufacturers whose ability to produce vacuum tubes has progressed over the past several years. The most significant competitive risk comes from technical obsolescence. Canvys faces many competitors in the markets we serve. Increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins or a loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. As we expand our business and pursue our growth initiatives, we may encounter increased competition from current and/or new competitors. Our failure to maintain and enhance our competitive position could have a material adverse effect on our business.</p>
<h2>We are dependent on a limited number of vendors to supply us with essential products.</h2>
<p>The products we supply are currently produced by a relatively small number of manufacturers. During fiscal 2024 two of our suppliers each represented 11% of our total cost of sales. Our success depends, in large part, on maintaining current vendor relationships and developing new relationships. To the extent that our significant suppliers are unwilling or unable to continue to do business with us, extend lead times, limit supplies due to capacity constraints or other factors, there could be a material adverse effect on our business.</p>
<h2>Disruptions to our supply chain could adversely impact our business.</h2>
<p>Material disruptions to our supply chains, including changes in our relationships with suppliers, shortages in availability of materials, production delays, regulatory restrictions, public health crises, or other supply chain disruptions, whether due to our suppliers or customers, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and results. Increases in the costs of supplies could result in manufacturing interruptions, delays, inefficiencies or our inability to market products. In addition, our profit margins would decrease if the prices of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods increase and we are unable to pass on those increases to our customers. Supply chain disruptions may be exacerbated by other events and conditions, including the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars, which could continue to adversely affect our ability to receive goods on a timely basis and increase our material costs. Short-term or sustained increases in market demand may exceed our suppliers' production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain. Our failure, or our suppliers' failure, to meet the demand for raw materials and components could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further disruptions to the supply chain because of other global or domestic events could materially adversely impact our operations and business. While we actively monitor and take steps to mitigate supply chain risk, there can be no assurance that our mitigation plans will prevent disruptions that may arise from shortages of materials that we use in the production of our products.</p>
<h2>We rely heavily on information technology systems that, if not properly functioning, could materially adversely affect our business.</h2>
<p>We rely on our information technology systems to process, analyze and manage data to facilitate the purchase, manufacture, and distribution of our products, as well as to receive, process, bill and ship orders on a timely basis. A significant disruption or failure in the design, operation, security or support of our information technology systems could significantly disrupt our business.</p>
<p>Our information technology systems are subject to the threat of cyber attacks, security breaches, computer hacking, as well as other damage, disruptions or shutdowns. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. They also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. Additionally, third parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers into disclosing sensitive information such as usernames, passwords or other information in order to gain access to our customers' data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information, employee information or our information technology systems. Our systems and the data stored on those systems may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks, acts of vandalism or theft, coordinated attacks by activist entities, misplaced or lost data, human errors or other similar events that could negatively affect our systems and its data, as well as the data of our business partners. Further, third parties, such as hosted solution providers, that provide services to us, could also be a source of security risk in the event of a failure of their own security systems and infrastructure.</p>
<p>The Company maintains various information technology protections designed to detect and reduce the likelihood of cybersecurity incidents, although there can be no assurance that our protections will be successful. The Company also regularly evaluates its protections against cybersecurity incidents, including in response to specific threats and as part of the Company's information security program. There can be no assurance, however, that the Company will be able to prevent or remediate all future cybersecurity incidents or that the cost associated with responding to any such incident or impact of such incident will not be significant or material. Further, our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential suppliers or customers. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal, proprietary or confidential information about us, our business partners or other third parties could expose us to significant potential liability and reputational harm. As threats related to cyber attacks develop and</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<p>grow, we may also find it necessary to make further investments to protect our data and infrastructure, which may impact our profitability. As a global enterprise, we could also be negatively impacted by existing and proposed laws and regulations, as well as government policies and practices related to cybersecurity, privacy, data localization and data protection.</p>
<h2>Our products may be found to be defective, or our services performed may result in equipment or product damage and, as a result, warranty and/or product liability claims may be asserted against us.</h2>
<p>We sell many of our components at prices that are significantly lower than the cost of the equipment or other goods in which they are incorporated. Because a defect or failure in a product could give rise to failures in the equipment that incorporates them, we may face claims for damages that are disproportionate to the revenues and profits we receive from the components involved in the claims. While we typically have provisions in our agreements with our suppliers that hold the supplier accountable for defective products, and we and our suppliers generally exclude consequential damages in our standard terms and conditions, our ability to avoid such liabilities may be limited as a result of various factors, including the inability to exclude such damages due to the laws of some of the countries where we do business. Our business could be adversely affected as a result of significant quality or performance issues in the components sold by us if we are required to pay for the damages. Although we have product liability insurance, such insurance is limited in coverage and amount.</p>
<h2>Substantial defaults by our customers on our accounts receivable or the loss of significant customers could have a significant negative impact on our business.</h2>
<p>We extend credit to our customers. The failure of a significant customer or a significant group of customers to timely pay all amounts due could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The extension of credit involves considerable judgment and is based on management's evaluation of factors that include such things as a customer's financial condition, payment history and the availability of collateral to secure customers' receivables. The risks associated with extending credit to our customers could be exacerbated by economic weakness and market disruption.</p>
<h2>Failure to successfully implement our growth initiatives, or failure to realize the benefits expected from these initiatives if implemented, may create ongoing operating losses or otherwise adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.</h2>
<p>Our growth strategy focuses on expanding our Green Energy Solutions, our healthcare and our power conversion businesses. We may be unable to implement our growth initiatives or strategic priorities or reach profitability in the near future or at all, due to many factors, including factors outside of our control. We also cannot be certain that executing on our strategy will generate the benefits we expect. If we fail to execute successfully on our strategic priorities, if we pursue strategic priorities that prove to be unsuccessful, or if our investments in these growth initiatives do not yield anticipated returns for any reason, our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be materially and adversely affected.</p>
<h2>We may not be successful in identifying, consummating and integrating future acquisitions, if any.</h2>
<p>We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition candidates or complete the acquisition of identified candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms. Also, acquisitions are accompanied by risks, such as potential exposure to unknown liabilities and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business. In addition, we may not obtain the expected benefits or cost savings from acquisitions. Acquisitions are subject to risks associated with financing the acquisition, and integrating the operations, personnel and systems of the acquired businesses. If any of these risks materialize, they may result in disruptions to our business and the diversion of management time and attention, which could increase the costs of operating our existing or acquired businesses or negate the expected benefits of the acquisitions.</p>
<h2>Economic weakness and uncertainty and other challenges could adversely affect our revenues and gross margins.</h2>
<p>Our revenues and gross profit margins depend significantly on global economic conditions, the demand for our products and services and the financial condition of our customers. Economic weakness and uncertainty have resulted in the past, and may result in the future, in decreased revenues and gross profit margins. Economic uncertainty also makes it more difficult for us to forecast overall supply and demand with a great deal of confidence. Financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets could result in tighter credit markets and lower levels of liquidity in some financial markets. The effects of a tightened credit environment could include the insolvency of key vendors or their inability to obtain credit to finance development and/or manufacture products resulting in product delays as well as the inability of customers to obtain credit to finance operations and/or customer insolvencies. Spending and the timing thereof by our customers may have a significant impact on our results and, where such spending is delayed or canceled, it could have a material negative impact on our operating results. Current global economic conditions remain uncertain and challenging. Weakness in the markets in which we operate could negatively impact our revenue and operating expenses, and consequently have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will continue recovery in the near future; nor is there any assurance that worldwide economic volatility will not continue or worsen.</p>
<p>Further, challenges in the supply chain and disruptions in our logistics capability could further negatively impact our gross profit margins. See We are dependent on a limited number of vendors to supply us with essential products, Disruptions to the supply chain could adversely impact our business and Major disruptions to our logistics capability or to the operations of our key vendors or customers could have a material adverse impact on our operations.</p>
<h2>Prolonged periods of inflation could increase costs, have an adverse effect on general economic conditions and impact consumer spending, which could impact our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.</h2>
<p>Rising levels of inflation continue to impact the markets in which we operate. If the inflation rate continues to increase, it can also push up the costs of labor and other expenses. If our revenues do not increase at the rate of inflation, we may not be able to maintain the same level of profitability. Inflation and government efforts to combat inflation, such as raising the benchmark interest rate, could increase market volatility and have an adverse effect on the financial market and general economic conditions. Such adverse conditions could negatively impact demand for our products, which could adversely affect our profitability, results of operations and cash flow.</p>
<h2>Our business and results of operations are subject to a broad range of uncertainties arising out of world and domestic events.</h2>
<p>Our operations could be adversely affected by uncertain conditions in global or regional economies, including conflict (such as Russia-Ukraine and IsraelHamas wars), higher inflation or interest rates, recession, natural disasters, impacts of and issues related to climate change, business disruptions, our ability to adequately staff operations or otherwise and may in the future result in the decline of conditions in markets in which we operate. Any future economic declines may result in decreased revenue, gross margins, earnings or growth rates or difficulty in managing inventory levels or collecting customer receivables. We also have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, increased competitive pricing pressure, raw material inflation and availability issues resulting in difficulties meeting customer demand. In addition, customer difficulties in the future could result from economic uncertainty or the deterioration of conditions in markets in which we operate, the cyclical nature of their respective businesses, such as in the oil and gas industry, or otherwise and, in turn, result in decreases in product demand, increases in bad debt write-offs, decreases in timely collection of accounts receivable and adjustments to our allowance for credit losses, resulting in material reductions to our revenues and net earnings.</p>
<h2>Major disruptions to our logistics capability or to the operations of our key vendors or customers could have a material adverse impact on our operations.</h2>
<p>We operate our global logistics services through specialized and centralized distribution centers. We depend on third party transportation service providers for the delivery of products to our customers. A major interruption or disruption in service at any of our distribution centers, or a disruption at the operations of any of our significant vendors or customers, for any reason, including reasons beyond our control (such as natural disasters, pandemics or other health crises, work stoppages, power loss, cyber attacks, incidents of terrorism or other significant disruptions of services from our third party providers) could cause cancellations or delays in a significant number of shipments to customers and, as a result, could have a severe impact on our business, operations and financial performance. Further, challenges within global logistics networks, including shortages of shipping containers, international port congestion, trucking shortages and freight capacity constraints have resulted in delays in receiving key manufacturing components and increased order backlogs and transportation costs. Such logistical disruption may cause us to incur higher costs and may also result in longer lead times for our customers. Uncertainties related to the magnitude and duration of global supply chain disruptions have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business. If we are unable to recover a substantial portion of the increase in material and transportation costs from our customers through price adjustments and/or surcharges, our business or results of operations could be adversely affected. We may also experience an increase in order cancellations if any such pricing actions are not accepted by our customers.</p>
<h2>Risks Related to International Operations</h2>
<h2>International operations represent a significant percentage of our business and present a variety of risks that could impact our results.</h2>
<p>Because we source and sell our products worldwide, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. These risks include the costs and difficulties of managing foreign entities, limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds, cultural differences that affect customer preferences and business practices, unstable political or economic conditions, geopolitical risks and demand or supply reactions from events that could include political crises and conflict (such as Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars), war, a major terrorist attack, natural disasters, actual or threatened public health emergencies, trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements, monetary policy, inflation, economic growth, recession, commodity prices, currency volatility, currency controls, and changes in tax laws.</p>
<p>We also face exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because we conduct business outside of the United States. Price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations may make our products less competitive or may have an adverse effect on our margins. Our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, when the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to the base currencies of the countries in which we sell our products, our U.S. dollar reported net revenue and income would decrease. We currently do not engage in any currency hedging transactions. We cannot predict whether foreign currency exchange risks inherent in doing business in foreign countries will have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results in the future. Further, global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. Negative or uncertain financial and macroeconomic conditions may have a significant adverse impact on our sales, profitability and results of operations.</p>
<h2>Certain of our products are subject to tariffs.</h2>
<p>Certain of the Company's products are manufactured in China and are imported into the United States. Our importation of products into the United States from China is subject to tariffs instituted and imposed from time to time by The Office of the United States Trade Representative. Management works with suppliers and customers to mitigate the impact of such tariffs on customer markets. Our sales and gross margins on certain products could be negatively impacted if we are unable to successfully pass through the additional cost of applicable tariffs, or if higher prices reduce demand for the Company's products.</p>
<h2>Financial Risks</h2>
<h2>There is a possible risk of identifiable intangible asset impairment, which could reduce the value of our assets and reduce our net income in the year in which the write-off occurs.</h2>
<p>Our intangible assets could become impaired, which could reduce the value of our assets and reduce our net income in the year in which the write-off occurs. We ascribe value to certain intangible assets which consist of customer lists and trade names resulting from acquisitions. An impairment charge on intangible assets would be incurred in the event that the fair value of the intangible assets is less than their current carrying values. We evaluate whether events have occurred that indicate all, or a portion, of the carrying amount of intangible assets may no longer be recoverable. If this is the case, an impairment charge to earnings would be necessary.</p>
<h2>Our indebtedness and restrictive covenants under our credit facility could limit our operational and financial flexibility.</h2>
<p>We may incur indebtedness in the future under our credit facility with PNC Bank NA. Our ability to make interest and scheduled principal payments on any such indebtedness and operate within restrictive covenants could be adversely impacted by changes in the availability, terms and cost of capital, changes in interest rates or changes in our credit ratings or our outlook. These changes could increase our cost of business, limiting our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities, react to market conditions and meet operational and capital needs, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage.</p>
<h2>Legal and Regulatory Risks</h2>
<h2>We may be subject to intellectual property rights claims, which are costly to defend, could require payment of damages or licensing fees, and/or could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future.</h2>
<p>Substantial litigation and threats of litigation regarding intellectual property rights exist in the display systems and electronics industries. From time to time, third parties, including certain companies in the business of acquiring patents with the intention of aggressively seeking licensing revenue from purported infringers, have asserted and may in the future assert patent and/or other intellectual property rights to technologies that are important to our business. In any dispute involving products that we have sold, our customers could also become the target of litigation. We are obligated in many instances to indemnify and defend our customers if the products we sell are alleged to infringe any third party's intellectual property rights. In some cases, depending on the nature of the claim, we may be able to seek indemnification from our suppliers for ourselves and our customers against such claims, but there is no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such indemnification or that we are fully protected against such claims. Any infringement claim brought against us, regardless of the duration, outcome or size of damage award, could result in substantial cost, divert our management's attention, be time consuming to defend, result in significant damage awards, cause product shipment delays, or require us to enter into royalty or other licensing agreements. See Note 11, Risks and Uncertainties , of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding specific legal matters related to our patents.</p>
<p>Additionally, if an infringement claim is successful, we may be required to pay damages or seek royalty or license arrangements which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms. The payment of any such damages or royalties may significantly increase our operating expenses and harm our operating results and financial condition. Also, royalty or license arrangements may not be available at all. We may have to stop selling certain products or certain technologies, which could affect our ability to compete effectively.</p>
<p>Potential lawsuits, with or without merit, may divert management's attention, and we may incur significant expenses in our defense. In addition, we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, become subject to injunctions or other equitable remedies, or determine to abandon certain lines of business, that may cause a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.</p>
<h2>We may incur substantial operational costs or be required to change our business practices to comply with data privacy and data protection laws and regulations around the world.</h2>
<p>We are subject to many privacy and data protection laws and regulations in various jurisdictions, which continue to evolve rapidly. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union, including more robust documentation requirements for data protection compliance programs. Specifically, the GDPR imposes numerous privacy-related requirements for companies operating in the EU, including greater control for data subjects, increased data portability for EU consumers and data breach notification requirements.</p>
<p>Complying with the GDPR may cause us to incur substantial operational costs or require us to change our business practices in ways that we cannot currently predict. Despite our efforts to bring our practices into compliance with the GDPR, we may not be successful. Non-compliance could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities, customers, data subjects or others. Fines of up to 20 million euros or up to 4% of the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater, may be imposed for violations of certain of the GDPR's requirements.</p>
<p>In addition, several other jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world have enacted privacy laws or regulations similar to GDPR. For instance, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), effective January 1, 2020, which gives consumers many of the same rights as those available under GDPR. Several laws similar to the CCPA have been proposed in the United States at both the federal and state level. The effects of, and costs incurred in connection with complying with, the GDPR, the CCPA and other data privacy laws and regulations may be significant and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply. Any actual or perceived failures to comply with the GDPR, the CCPA or other data privacy laws or regulations, or related contractual or other obligations, or any perceived privacy rights violation, could lead to investigations, claims and proceedings by governmental entities and private parties, damages for contract breach, and other significant costs, penalties and other liabilities, as well as harm to our reputation and market position.</p>
<h2>Our international sales and operations are subject to applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations.</h2>
<p>We are subject to applicable export control laws and regulations of the United States and other countries. United States laws and regulations applicable to us include the Arms Export Control Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulations ("ITAR"), the Export Administration Regulations ("EAR"), anti-money laundering laws and regulations and the trade and trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the Office of the United States Trade Representative and the United States Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. The import and export of our products are subject to international trade agreements, the modification or repeal of which could impact our business. The U.S. government agencies responsible for administering EAR and ITAR have significant discretion in the interpretation and enforcement of these regulations. Violations of these laws or regulations could result in significant additional sanctions including fines, more onerous compliance requirements, more extensive debarments from export privileges, loss of authorizations needed to conduct aspects of our international business and criminal penalties and may harm our ability to enter contracts with customers who have contracts with the U.S. government. A violation of the laws or the regulations enumerated above could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.</p>
<h2>Ongoing changes to tariffs and trade relations may adversely affect our business.</h2>
<p>Our international operations are subject to changing tariffs and developments in trade relations. The U.S. government has made statements and taken certain actions that have led to, and may in the future lead to, further changes to U.S. and international trade policies, including recently imposed tariffs affecting certain products exported by a number of U.S. trading partners, including China.</p>
<p>There were no changes or additional tariffs that affected our fiscal 2024 operations. In May 2024, the U.S. government announced proposed tariff modifications for certain products from China. Proposed tariffs of 25%, 50% and 100% on certain products from China are expected to become effective on August 1, 2024, January 1, 2025, and January 1, 2026. These tariff modifications are not expected to materially impact our Company.</p>
<p>It is possible that further tariffs may be imposed on imports of our products, including by other countries, or that our business will be impacted by changing trade relations among countries. This may cause us to raise prices or make changes to our operations, any of which could adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, customers, suppliers and/or the United States economy or certain sectors thereof and, thus, to adversely impact our businesses and results of operations. Given the evolving nature of trade relations, the impact on our operations and results is uncertain and could be significant. We can provide no assurance that any strategies we implement to mitigate the impact of such tariffs or other trade actions will be successful. To the extent that our supply chain, costs, sales or profitability are negatively affected by the tariffs or other trade actions, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.</p>
<h2>Ownership Risks</h2>
<h2>A single stockholder controls a majority of the Company's voting stock.</h2>
<p>As of July 26, 2024, Edward J. Richardson, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, beneficially owned approximately 98% of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock, representing approximately 61% of the voting power of the outstanding common stock. This share ownership permits Mr. Richardson to exert control over the outcome of stockholder votes, including votes concerning the election of directors, by-law amendments, possible mergers, corporate control contests and other significant corporate transactions.</p>
<h2>General Risk Factors</h2>
<h2>Failure to attract and retain key skilled personnel could hurt operations.</h2>
<p>Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of key management personnel, particularly Mr. Richardson. While we have employment contracts in place with several of our executive officers, we nevertheless cannot be assured that we will retain our key employees and the loss of service of any of these officers or key management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business growth and operating results.</p>
<p>Our future success will require an ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Competition for such key personnel is intense and we cannot be assured that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel. We cannot make assurances that key personnel will not depart in the future. Changes in the cost of providing employee benefits in order to attract and retain personnel, including changes in health care costs, could lead to increased costs in any of our operations.</p>
<h2>If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls or discover material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to detect fraud or report our financial results accurately or timely.</h2>
<p>An effective internal control environment is necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and is an important part of our effort to prevent financial fraud. We are required to periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our internal controls over financial reporting. Based on these evaluations, we may conclude that enhancements, modifications or changes to internal controls are necessary or desirable. While management evaluates the effectiveness of our internal controls on a regular basis, these controls may not always be effective. There are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of internal controls, including fraud, collusion, management override and failure in human judgment. In addition, control procedures are designed to reduce rather than eliminate business risks.</p>
<p>If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, or if management or our independent registered public accounting firm discovers material weaknesses in our internal controls, we may be unable to produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud. In addition, we may be subject to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission or NASDAQ. Any such actions could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements.</p>
<h2>If we are deemed to be an investment company, we will be required to meet burdensome compliance requirements and restrictions on our activities.</h2>
<p>We have had significant cash and investments. If we are deemed to be an "investment company" as defined under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Investment Company Act"), the nature of our investments may be subject to various restrictions. We do not believe that our principal activities subject us to the Investment Company Act. If we are deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with required additional regulatory burdens would increase our operating expenses.</p>
<h2>Evolving expectations around corporate responsibility practices, specifically related to environmental, social and governance ("ESG") matters, may expose us to reputational and other risks.</h2>
<p>Investors, stockholders, customers, suppliers and other third parties are increasingly focusing on ESG and corporate social responsibility endeavors and reporting. Certain institutional investors, investment funds, other influential investors, customers, suppliers and other third parties are also increasingly focused on ESG practices. Companies that do not adapt to or comply with the evolving investor or stakeholder expectations and standards, or which are perceived to have not responded appropriately, may suffer from reputational damage and result in the business, financial condition and/or stock price of a company being materially and adversely affected. Further, this increased focus on ESG issues may result in new regulations and/or third-party requirements that could adversely impact our business, or certain shareholders reducing or eliminating their holdings of our stock. Additionally, an allegation or perception that the Company has not taken sufficient action in these areas could negatively harm our reputation.</p>
<h2>Our stock price may be volatile.</h2>
<p>Our stock price has fluctuated in the past and may experience declines in the future as a result of the volatile nature of the stock market, developments in our business and/or factors outside of our control including certain of the risk factors discussed in this report. Many factors may cause the market price for our common stock to change, including: (i) our operating results as compared to investors' expectations in any period, (ii) market perceptions concerning our future earnings prospects, (iii) adverse changes in general market conditions or economic trends and (iv) changes or events in our industry or the world, such as market reactions to public health issues, natural disasters, changes in global, national, or regional economies, inflation, governmental policies, political unrest, military action and armed conflicts (such as the Russia-Ukraine and Israel-Hamas wars), terrorist activities, political and social turmoil, civil unrest and other crises.</p>
<h2>ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments</h2>
<p>None.</p>
<h2>ITEM 1C. Cybersecurity</h2>
<h2>Risk Management and Strategy</h2>
<p>We are focused on the growing threat of cybersecurity risks we face in today's global business environment and have identified cybersecurity as an important enterprise risk. Our cybersecurity risk management program is part of our overall enterprise risk management program, and focuses on identifying, assessing, managing, and remediating material risks from cybersecurity incidents. We rely on risk-based security controls, including access limitations and contractual requirements on thirdparty service providers, as part of our overall approach of protecting the integrity, availability and confidentiality of our important systems and information.</p>
<p>The Company follows the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology ("NIST") Cyber Security Framework to structure protocols for identifying, assessing and managing cybersecurity risks. In accordance with NIST guidance, we maintain documented information security policies and standards to protect operations, assets, data and services and to defend against, respond to and recover from potential cyber attacks.</p>
<p>These policies and standards include both preventive measures and reactive processes. Preventive measures include, but are not limited to, protective and detective cybersecurity systems, security monitoring, threat hunting and mandatory, enterprise-wide employee training. Our reactive processes are captured primarily by a cyber incident response plan (the "IRP"), which is comprised of an evolving set of procedures developed by cross-functional experts, and external consultants, who draw upon technical proficiency and learnings from past experiences. All of these procedures and practices are tailored to our technology environment and are refined iteratively. Further, we have an information risk management program that includes a vendor risk assessment process, whereby we systematically oversee and identify risks from cybersecurity threats related to its use of third-party service providers.</p>
<p>The IRP is executed by an Incident Response Team ("IRT"), led by our Information Systems Director. The exact composition of the IRT varies depending on the severity and potential impact of an incident and will typically include internal IT professionals and stakeholders across corporate and business functions. The team collaborates with internal experts and may engage external resources to assess and contain a threat if deemed necessary. Such external resources may potentially include forensic investigation and response firms, law firms, forensic accountants, and consultants who are on retainer contracts for expedited availability.</p>
<p>While cybersecurity threats remain a risk to the Company's business operations, our risk mitigation strategies have been effective. Accordingly, no such threats have materially affected our business strategy, results of operations or our financial condition. For more information regarding how cybersecurity threats could materially affect our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition, see We rely heavily on information technology systems that, if not properly functioning, could materially adversely affect our business in Item 1A, Risk Factors .</p>
<h2>Governance</h2>
<p>Our Board of Directors has overall responsibility for enterprise risk management and has delegated the oversight of cybersecurity risks to the Audit Committee. The Company's Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") immediately updates the Audit Committee on any significant cybersecurity incidents and/or threat that may require an 8-K filing. Furthermore, the CFO reports quarterly to the Audit Committee on any significant cybersecurity incidents, threats, mitigation strategies and controls at each Audit Committee meeting. The Audit Committee then updates the full board on significant matters raised and discussed during these sessions.</p>
<p>The Audit Committee delegates day-to-day management of cybersecurity risks to the Company's senior management, which includes our CFO, who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer. Our CFO leads a team of dedicated professionals who are responsible for a wide range of risk assessment and management and leads specialized teams of internal and external experts focusing on distinct categories of threats.</p>
<h2>ITEM 2. Properties</h2>
<p>The Company owns one facility and leases 25 facilities. We own our corporate facility and largest distribution center, which is located on approximately 100 acres in LaFox, Illinois and consists of approximately 224,000 square feet of manufacturing, warehouse and office space. We maintain geographically diverse facilities because we believe this provides value to our customers and suppliers, and limits market risk and exchange rate exposure. We believe our properties are well maintained and adequate for our present needs. The extent of utilization varies from property to property and from time to time during the year.</p>
<p>Our facility locations, their primary use and segments served are as follows:</p>

<h2>ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations</h2>
<p>The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes.</p>
<p>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&amp;A") is intended to assist the reader in better understanding our business, results of operations, financial condition, changes in financial condition, critical accounting estimates and significant developments. MD&amp;A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this filing. This section is organized as follows:</p>
<h2>· Business Overview</h2>
<p>· Results of Operations - an analysis and comparison of our consolidated results of operations for the fiscal years ended June 1, 2024, May 27, 2023 and May 28, 2022, as reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.</p>
<p>· Liquidity, Financial Position and Capital Resources - a discussion of our primary sources and uses of cash for the fiscal years ended June 1, 2024, May 27, 2023 and May 28, 2022, and a discussion of changes in our financial position.</p>
<h2>Business Overview</h2>
<p>Richardson Electronics, Ltd. (the "Company," "we," "our") is a leading global manufacturer of engineered solutions, power grid and microwave tubes and related consumables; power conversion and RF and microwave components; high-value replacement parts, tubes and service training for diagnostic imaging equipment; and customized display solutions. Nearly 55% of our products are manufactured at our facilities located in LaFox, Illinois, Marlborough, Massachusetts and Donaueschingen, Germany, or by one of our manufacturing partners throughout the world. We serve customers in the alternative energy, healthcare, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific and semiconductor markets. The Company's strategy is to provide specialized technical expertise and "engineered solutions" based on our core engineering and manufacturing capabilities. The Company provides solutions and adds value through design-in support, systems integration, prototype design and manufacturing, testing, logistics and aftermarket technical service and repair through its global infrastructure.</p>
<p>Some of the Company's products are manufactured in China and imported into the United States. The Office of the United States Trade Representative ("USTR") instituted tariffs on the importation of a number of products into the United States from China. These tariffs are a response to what the USTR considers to be certain unfair trade practices by China. A number of the Company's products manufactured in China are subject to duties of 25% when imported into the United States.</p>
<p>Management continues to work with its suppliers as well as its customers to mitigate the impact of the tariffs on our customers' markets. However, if the Company is unable to successfully pass through the additional cost of these tariffs, or if the higher prices reduce demand for the Company's products, it will have a negative effect on the Company's sales and gross margins.</p>
<p>The Company reports its financial performance based on the operating and reportable segments defined as follows:</p>
<p>Power and Microwave Technologies ("PMT") combines our core engineered solutions capabilities, power grid and microwave tube business with new disruptive RF, Wireless and Power technologies.

<p>Gross profit reflects the distribution and manufacturing product margin less manufacturing variances, inventory obsolescence charges, customer returns, scrap and cycle count adjustments, engineering costs and other provisions.</p>
<p>Consolidated gross profit was $60.0 million during fiscal 2024, compared to $83.7 million during fiscal 2023. Consolidated gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 30.5% for fiscal 2024, compared to the 31.9% during fiscal 2023, primarily due to unfavorable product mix and manufacturing under absorption for PMT, unfavorable product mix for GES, favorable product mix and lower freight costs for Canvys and increased manufacturing under absorption for Healthcare. Gross margin during fiscal 2024 included expense related to inventory provisions of $0.4 million for PMT, $0.1 million for Canvys and $0.1 million for Healthcare.</p>
<p>Consolidated gross profit was $83.7 million during fiscal 2023, compared to $71.7 million during fiscal 2022. Consolidated gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 31.9 % for fiscal 2023, the same as the 31.9% during fiscal 2022, primarily due to favorable product mix for PMT, unfavorable product mix for GES, unfavorable product mix for Canvys and improved manufacturing absorption and decreased component scrap for Healthcare. Gross margin during fiscal 2023 included expense related to inventory provisions of $0.3 million for PMT, $0.1 million for Canvys and $0.1 million for Healthcare.</p>
<h2>Power and Microwave Technologies</h2>
<p>Net sales for PMT decreased 21.7% to $128.7 million during fiscal 2024 from $164.3 million during fiscal 2023. The decrease was mainly due to lower sales of semi-wafer fabrication products reflecting the cyclical slowdown in that market. RF and Wireless sales were also down due to a slowdown in the infrastructure business in Asia. However, the health of the business continues to be strong as we gain market share with new products and customers. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 30.1% during fiscal 2024 as compared to 32.9% during fiscal 2023, primarily due to unfavorable product mix and manufacturing under absorption.</p>
<p>Net sales for PMT increased 5.7% to $164.3 million during fiscal 2023 from $155.4 million during fiscal 2022. The increase was mainly due to strong growth in the semi-wafer fabrication industry for the first nine months and the RF and microwave products for various applications. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 32.9% during fiscal 2023 as compared to 32.7% during fiscal 2022, primarily due to product mix.</p>
<h2>Green Energy Solutions</h2>
<p>Net sales for GES decreased 51.2% to $23.2 million during fiscal 2024 from $47.6 million during fiscal 2023. The decrease reflected the project-based nature of the wind turbine business and was mainly due to lower shipments to EV locomotive customers as they struggled with lead-times of other products to complete the locomotives and ship to their end customers for Beta testing. Comparative sales were also impacted by a large shipment of battery modules in fiscal 2023 that did not recur in fiscal 2024. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 28.4% during fiscal 2024 as compared to 28.8% during fiscal 2023, primarily due to product mix. However, like PMT we continue to gain market share in this segment.</p>
<p>Net sales for GES increased 110.5% to $47.6 million during fiscal 2023 from $22.6 million during fiscal 2022. The increase was mainly due to growth in related product sales to the wind turbine industry, as well as EV battery modules. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 28.8% during fiscal 2023 as compared to 32.0% during fiscal 2022, primarily due to product mix.</p>
<h2>Canvys</h2>
<p>Net sales for Canvys decreased 17.5% to $32.4 million during fiscal 2024, from $39.3 million during fiscal 2023. Sales decreased primarily due to lower sales in the North American market resulting from high interest rates negatively impacting our medical OEM customers. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 33.8% during fiscal 2024 as compared to 31.5% during fiscal 2023 due to product mix and lower freight costs.</p>
<p>Net sales for Canvys increased 11.8% to $39.3 million during fiscal 2023, from $35.2 million during fiscal 2022. Sales increased primarily due to strong sales in the North American market. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 31.5% during fiscal 2023 as compared to 32.0% during fiscal 2022 mainly due to product mix.</p>
<h2>Healthcare</h2>
<p>Net sales for Healthcare increased 5.7% to $12.1 million during fiscal 2024, from $11.4 during fiscal 2023. The increase in sales was primarily due to higher part and CT tube sales. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly to 30.4% during fiscal 2024, compared to 30.7% during fiscal 2023. The decrease was primarily due to increased manufacturing under absorption, offset by an improved product mix.</p>
<p>Net sales for Healthcare increased 0.5% to $11.4 million during fiscal 2023, essentially unchanged from fiscal 2022. The slight increase in sales was primarily due to an increase in equipment sales, partially offset by decreases in part sales and CT tube sales. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 30.7% during fiscal 2023, compared to 21.2% during fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily due to improved manufacturing absorption and decreased component scrap expenses.</p>

<p>We sell our products to customers in diversified industries and perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition. Terms are generally on open account, payable net 30 days in North America, and vary throughout Asia/Pacific, Europe and Latin America. Estimates of credit losses are recorded in the financial statements based on monthly reviews of outstanding accounts.</p>
<h2>Selling, General and Administrative Expenses</h2>
<p>Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&amp;A") increased 1.4% during fiscal 2024 to $59.5 million from $58.7 million during fiscal 2023. This increase in SG&amp;A from fiscal 2023 was mainly due to higher R&amp;D expenses, partially offset by lower incentives due to financial performance. SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales increased to 30.3% during fiscal 2024 as compared to 22.4% during fiscal 2023.</p>
<p>Selling, general and administrative expenses increased during fiscal 2023 to $58.7 million from $55.7 million during fiscal 2022. This increase in SG&amp;A expense from fiscal 2022 was mainly due to higher employee compensation and travel expenses, partially offset by lower legal fees and a lower bad debt expense. SG&amp;A as a percentage of sales decreased to 22.4% during fiscal 2023 as compared to 24.8% during fiscal 2022.</p>
<h2>Other Income/Expense</h2>
<p>Other expense was $0.2 million during fiscal 2024, compared to other income of less than $0.1 million during fiscal 2023. Fiscal 2024 had $0.3 million of investment income the same as fiscal 2023. Our foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily due to the translation of U.S. dollars held in non-U.S. entities. The foreign exchange loss reported for fiscal 2024 totaled $0.4 million compared to $0.3 million for fiscal 2023. We currently do not utilize derivative instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency.</p>
<h2>Income Tax Provision</h2>
<p>Our income tax provision (benefit) during fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 was $0.1 million, $2.7 million and ($2.2 million), respectively. The effective income tax rates during fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 were 61.4%, 10.8% and (13.7%), respectively. The difference between the effective income tax rates as compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0% during fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 was primarily driven by the impact of valuation allowance changes related to the realizability of our U.S. state and federal net deferred tax assets and changes in our geographical distribution of income (loss). In addition, the Company recognized both foreign tax and research and development ("R&amp;D") tax credits in fiscal 2024.</p>
<p>During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company recorded R&amp;D tax credits of $0.5 million. These credits represent the expected U.S. federal credits to be claimed for fiscal 2024.</p>
<p>Net deferred tax assets related to domestic state NOL carryforwards at June 1, 2024 amounted to approximately $1.8 million, compared to $2.1 million at May 27, 2023. Net deferred tax assets related to foreign NOL carryforwards was $0.1 million as of June 1, 2024, and $0.2 million as of May 27, 2023 with various or indefinite expiration dates. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 we increased the valuation allowance on the state net operating losses by $0.9 million resulting in a total valuation allowance against state net operating losses of $1.1 million.</p>
<p>We have historically determined that undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, to the extent of cash available, will be repatriated to the U.S. The deferred tax liability on the outside basis difference is now primarily withholding tax on future dividend distributions. The deferred tax liability related to undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries was less than $0.1 million in both fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023.</p>
<p>Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to support a more likely than not assertion that its deferred tax assets will be realized. A significant component of objective evidence evaluated was the cumulative income or loss incurred in each jurisdiction over the three-year period ended June 1, 2024. We considered other positive evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance in the U.S. including the subpart F and GILTI inclusions of our foreign earnings, the changes in our business performance in recent years, and the utilization of federal NOLs. The weight of this positive evidence is sufficient to outweigh other negative evidence in evaluating our need for a valuation allowance in the U.S. federal jurisdiction. As of June 1, 2024, we recorded a $0.9 million valuation allowance on state NOLs as there was more negative evidence which limited the Company's ability to utilize the state NOLs, including the anticipated expiration of some state NOLs prior to utilization and legislation restrictions for some states.</p>
<p>As of June 1, 2024, a valuation allowance of $2.1 million was recorded, representing the portion of the deferred tax asset that management does not believe is more likely than not to be realized. The valuation allowance as of May 27, 2023 was $1.4 million. The valuation allowance relates to state NOLs ($1.1 million) and deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions where historical taxable losses have been incurred ($1.0 million). The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are increased, or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.</p>
<p>Income taxes paid, net of refunds, including foreign estimated tax payments, were less than $0.1 million, $4.8 million and $1.5 million, during fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively.</p>
<p>In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. Years prior to fiscal 2015 are closed for examination under the statute of limitation for U.S. federal and U.S. state. In the Netherlands, years prior to fiscal 2019 are closed for examination. We are under examination in Germany for fiscal years 2019 to 2022. We have no current open audits in the U.S.</p>
<p>The Company recorded a $0.1 million uncertain tax position as of June 1, 2024 as compared to not recording an uncertain tax position as of May 27, 2023. We record interest related to uncertain tax positions in the income tax expense line item within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Accrued interest was included within the related tax liability line in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have recorded a liability of less than $0.1 million for interest as of June 1, 2024.</p>
<h2>Liquidity, Financial Position and Capital Resources</h2>
<p>Our operations and cash needs have been primarily financed through income from operations and cash on hand.</p>
<p>Cash and cash equivalents were $24.3 million at June 1, 2024. Cash and cash equivalents by geographic area at June 1, 2024 consisted of $7.1 million in North America, $7.3 million in Europe, $1.1 million in Latin America and $8.8 million in Asia/Pacific. We repatriated $0.3 million to the United States in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 from our entity in Mexico. Although the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act generally eliminated federal income tax on future cash repatriation to the United States, cash repatriation may be subject to state and local taxes, withholding or similar taxes. See Note 8, Income Taxes , of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.</p>
<p>Cash and cash equivalents were $25.0 million at May 27, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents by geographic area at May 27, 2023 consisted of $8.1 million in North America, $8.6 million in Europe, $1.5 million in Latin America and $6.8 million in Asia/Pacific. No funds were repatriated to the United States in fiscal 2023 from our foreign entities.</p>
<p>Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that the existing sources of liquidity, including current cash, will provide sufficient resources to meet known capital requirements and working capital needs through the next twelve months. Additionally, while our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the economy and the outlook for growth in our markets, we believe our existing sources of liquidity as well as our ability to generate operating cash flows will satisfy our future obligations and cash requirements.</p>
<p>On March 20, 2023, the Company established a senior, secured revolving credit facility agreement with a three-year term in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $30 million, including a swingline loan and a letter of credit sub-facility (collectively, the "Revolving Credit Facility") with PNC Bank. The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by the Company's domestic subsidiaries. Proceeds of the borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are expected to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company utilized $3.7 million of the credit line to address short-term cash requirements and repaid that $3.7 million during the fiscal 2024. As of the end of fiscal 2024 and the date of this report, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.</p>
<h2>Cash Flows from Operating Activities</h2>
<p>Cash flow from operating activities primarily resulted from our net income adjusted for non-cash items and changes in our operating assets and liabilities.</p>
<p>Operating activities provided $6.5 million of cash during fiscal 2024. We had net income of $0.1 million during fiscal 2024, which included non-cash stockbased compensation expense of $1.3 million associated with the issuance of stock option awards and restricted stock awards, $0.6 million of inventory provisions and depreciation and amortization expense of $4.3 million associated with our property and equipment as well as amortization of our intangible assets, and a $1.0 million increase in deferred income taxes. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities provided cash of $1.2 million during fiscal 2024, mainly due to a decrease in receivables of $5.3 million, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $4.7 million and a decrease in prepaid expenses of $0.3 million. The majority of the decrease in receivables reflected lower sales revenue compared to the prior year fourth quarter. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was due to lower year-end accruals and timing.</p>
<p>Operating activities utilized $8.2 million of cash during fiscal 2023. We had net income of $22.3 million during fiscal 2023, which included non-cash stockbased compensation expense of $0.9 million associated with the issuance of stock option awards and restricted stock awards, $0.5 million of inventory provisions and depreciation and amortization expense of $3.7 million associated with our property and equipment as well as amortization of our intangible assets. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in a use of cash of $35.5 million during fiscal 2023, mainly due to an increase in inventories of $30.5 million, a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $4.4 million and an increase in prepaid expenses of $0.5 million. The majority of the inventory increase was to support our Electron tube, PMG, Green Energy Solutions, LaFox manufacturing and Healthcare businesses. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was due to revenue recognition and timing.</p>
<h2>Cash Flows from Investing Activities</h2>
<p>The cash flow from investing activities consisted primarily of purchases and maturities of investments and capital expenditures.</p>
<p>Cash used by investing activities during fiscal 2024 was due to the $4.0 million of capital expenditures. Those capital expenditures were primarily related to our LaFox manufacturing business and facility renovation and IT systems.</p>
<p>Cash used by investing activities of $2.2 million during fiscal 2023 was mainly attributed to $7.4 million in capital expenditures with a $5.0 million offset for the maturities of a Certificate of Deposit (CD). Capital expenditures were primarily related to our LaFox manufacturing business and facility renovation, IT systems and the Healthcare business.</p>
<p>Our purchases and proceeds from investments consist of time deposits and CDs. Purchasing of future investments may vary from period to period due to interest and foreign currency exchange rates.</p>
<h2>Cash Flows from Financing Activities</h2>
<p>The cash flow from financing activities primarily consists of cash dividends paid.</p>
<p>Cash used in financing activities of $2.9 million during fiscal 2024 resulted primarily from the $3.4 million used to pay dividends to shareholders with a $0.6 million offset for the proceeds from stock option exercises.</p>
<p>Cash provided by financing activities of $0.4 million during fiscal 2023 resulted primarily from the $3.8 million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock from stock option exercises and the $3.3 million used to pay dividends to shareholders.</p>
<p>All future payments of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Dividend payments will depend on earnings, capital requirements, operating conditions and such other factors that the Board may deem relevant.</p>

<h2>Critical Accounting Estimates</h2>
<p>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Our assumptions, judgments and estimates are based on historical experience and various other factors deemed relevant. Actual results could be materially different from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates on a regular basis. We also discuss our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>We believe the assumptions, judgments and estimates involved for the following have the greatest potential impact on our Consolidated Financial</p>
<h2>Statements:</h2>
<ul>
<li>·Allowance for Credit Losses</li>
<li>·Revenue Recognition</li>
<li>·Inventories, net</li>
<li>·Intangible and Long-Lived Assets</li>
<li>·Income Taxes</li>
</ul>
<h2>Allowance for Credit Losses</h2>
<p>Our allowance for credit losses includes estimated losses that result from uncollectible receivables. The estimates are influenced by the following: continuing credit evaluation of customers' financial conditions; aging of receivables, individually and in the aggregate; a large number of customers which are widely dispersed across geographic areas; and collectability and delinquency history by geographic area. Significant changes in one or more of these considerations may require adjustments affecting net income and net carrying value of accounts receivable.</p>
<h2>Revenue Recognition</h2>
<p>Our customers are generally not resellers, but rather businesses that incorporate our products into their processes from which they generate an economic benefit. The goods are also distinct in that each item sold to the customer is clearly identified on both the purchase order and resulting invoice. Each product we sell benefits the customer independently of the other products. Each item on each purchase order from the customer can be used by the customer unrelated to any other products we provide to the customer.</p>
<p>The Company's revenue includes the following streams:</p>
<ul>
<li>·Manufacturing/assembly</li>
<li>·Distribution</li>
<li>·Services revenue</li>
</ul>
<p>Manufacturing/assembly typically includes the products that are manufactured or assembled in our manufacturing facility. These products can either be built to the customer's prints/designs or are products that we stock in our warehouse to sell to any customer that places an order. The manufacturing business does not include a separate service bundled with the product sold or sold in addition to the product. Our contracts for customized products generally include termination provisions if a customer cancels its order. However, we recognize revenue at a point in time because the termination provisions normally do not require, upon cancellation, the customer to pay fees that are commensurate with the work performed. Each purchase order explicitly states the goods or service that we promise to transfer to the customer. The promises to the customer are limited only to those goods or service. The performance obligation is our promise to deliver both goods that were produced by the Company and resale of goods that we purchase from our suppliers. Our shipping and handling activities for destination shipments are performed prior to the customer obtaining control. As such, they are not a separate promised service. The Company elects to account for shipping and handling as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the goods. The goods we provide to our customers are distinct in that our customers benefit from the goods we sell them through use in their own processes.</p>
<p>Distribution typically includes products purchased from our suppliers, stocked in our warehouses and then sold to our customers. The distribution business does not include a separate service bundled with the product sold or sold on top of the product. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers, which is simultaneous with the title transferring to the customer, in an amount that reflects the transaction price consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods. Control refers to the ability of the customer to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of, the remaining benefits from the goods. Our transaction price consideration is fixed, unless otherwise disclosed below as variable consideration. Generally, our contracts require our customers to pay for goods after we deliver products to them. Terms are generally on open account, payable net 30 days in North America, and vary throughout Asia/Pacific, Europe and Latin America subject to customary credit checks.</p>
<p>Repair, installation or training activities generate services revenue. The services we provide are relatively short in duration and are typically completed in one or two weeks. Therefore, at each reporting date, the amount of unbilled work is insignificant. The services revenue has consistently accounted for less than 5% of the Company's total revenues and is expected to continue at that level.</p>
<h2>Inventories, net</h2>
<p>Our consolidated inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value, generally using a weighted-average cost method. Our net inventories include finished goods, raw materials and work-in-progress.</p>
<p>We do not anticipate any material risks or uncertainties related to possible future inventory write-downs. Provisions for obsolete or slow-moving inventories are recorded based upon regular analysis of stock rotation privileges, obsolescence, the exiting of certain markets and assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If future demand changes in an industry or market conditions differ from management's estimates, additional provisions may be necessary.</p>
<h2>Intangible and Long-Lived Assets</h2>
<p>Our intangible assets reflect their fair value. Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined by quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models.</p>
<p>We review property and equipment, definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable. We conduct annual reviews for idle and underutilized equipment and review business plans for possible impairment. If adverse events do occur, our impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the long-lived assets are largely independent of other groups of our assets and liabilities. This analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology, the continued success of product lines and future volume, revenue and expense growth rates.</p>
<h2>Income Taxes</h2>
<p>We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and determine the need for a valuation allowance based on a number of factors, including both positive and negative evidence. These factors include historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income or loss, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies. In circumstances where we, or any of our affiliates, have incurred three years of cumulative losses which constitute significant negative evidence, positive evidence of equal or greater significance is needed to overcome the negative evidence before a tax benefit is recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards.</p>
<h2>New Accounting Pronouncements</h2>
<p>A summary of the New Accounting Pronouncements is provided in Note 3, Significant Accounting Policies and Disclosures.</p>
<h2>ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk</h2>
<h2>Risk Management and Market Sensitive Financial Instruments</h2>
<p>We are exposed to many different market risks with the various industries we serve. The primary financial risk we are exposed to is foreign currency exchange, as certain operations, assets and liabilities of ours are denominated in foreign currencies. We manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities.</p>
<h2>Foreign Currency Exposure</h2>
<p>Even though we take into account current foreign currency exchange rates at the time an order is taken, our financial statements, denominated in a non-U.S. functional currency, are subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.</p>
<p>Our foreign denominated assets and liabilities are cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and intercompany receivables and payables, as we conduct business in countries of the European Union, Asia/Pacific and, to a lesser extent, Canada and Latin America. We do manage foreign exchange exposures by using currency clauses in certain sales contracts. We have not used any derivative instruments nor entered into any forward contracts in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022.</p>
<p>Had the U.S. dollar changed unfavorably 10% against various foreign currencies, foreign denominated net sales would have been lower by an estimated $10.8 million during fiscal 2024, an estimated $12.2 million during fiscal 2023 and an estimated $12.1 million during fiscal 2022. Total assets would have declined by an estimated $4.6 million as of the fiscal year ended June 1, 2024 and an estimated $4.3 million as of the fiscal year ended May 27, 2023, while the total liabilities would have decreased by an estimated $1.2 million as of the fiscal year ended June 1, 2024 and an estimated $1.1 million as of the fiscal year ended May 27, 2023.</p>
<p>The interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in exchange rates would likely influence other economic factors. Such factors, which are not readily quantifiable, would likely also affect our operations. Additional disclosure regarding various market risks is set forth in Part I, Item 1A , Risk Factors , of our Annual Report on this Form 10-K.</p>
<h2>ITEM 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data</h2>
<h2>Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm</h2>
<p>Stockholders and Board of Directors Richardson Electronics, Ltd. LaFox, Illinois</p>
<h2>Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements</h2>
<p>We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Richardson Electronics, Ltd. (the "Company") as of June 1, 2024 and May 27, 2023, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 1, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at June 1 2024 and May 27, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 1, 2024 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.</p>
<p>We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB"), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 1, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO") and our report dated August 5, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.</p>
<h2>Basis for Opinion</h2>
<p>These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.</p>
<p>We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.</p>
<p>Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</p>
<h2>Critical Audit Matter</h2>
<p>The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.</p>
<h2>Estimation of Inventory Reserve - Power and Microwave Technologies ("PMT") Reportable Segment</h2>
<p>As described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the consolidated inventory balance as of June 1, 2024 was $110.1 million, net of $6.0 million in reserves. Provisions for obsolete or slow-moving inventories are based upon regular analysis of stock rotation privileges, obsolescence, the exiting of certain markets and assumptions about future demand and market conditions. A number of products in the PMT segment represent trailing edge technology. PMT often buys products ahead of supplier price increases and extended lead times which can create higher levels of inventory. As technologies evolve and customers replace their equipment, the market for and resulting net realizable value of PMT's products may decline.</p>
<p>We have identified the Company's estimation of inventory reserve for the PMT segment as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments required by management in estimating net realizable value for certain inventory items. The Company's estimation of its inventory reserve, performed on an item-by-item basis, requires inputs from operations personnel and an assessment of current market conditions and future industry trends, which can be difficult to predict given evolving technologies and the declining market for some products. Auditing this matter involved especially challenging auditor judgment due to the nature and extent of audit effort needed to evaluate the reasonableness of management's estimate of future demands.</p>
<p>The primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter included:</p>
<ul>
<li>·Testing the design, implementation, and operating effectiveness of controls over the development of the Company's estimation of the inventory reserve.</li>
<li>·Assessing the reasonableness of management's estimate of future demand by selecting a sample and (i) inquiring of operations personnel as to their assessment as to viability of aged and slow-moving inventory, (ii) evaluating historical customer ordering trends and current uses, and (iii) when applicable, evaluating stock rotation privileges.</li>
<li>·Evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates by performing a retrospective comparison of prior period inventory on hand for certain products to current period sales, write-offs, and inventory consumption.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Richardson Electronics, Ltd.</h2>
<h2>Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements</h2>
<h2>1.DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY</h2>
<p>Richardson Electronics, Ltd. (the "Company," "we," "our") is a leading global manufacturer of engineered solutions, power grid and microwave tubes and related consumables; power conversion and RF and microwave components; high-value replacement parts, tubes and service training for diagnostic imaging equipment; and customized display solutions.

We serve customers in the alternative energy, healthcare, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific and semiconductor markets. The Company's strategy is to provide specialized technical expertise and "engineered solutions" based on our core engineering and manufacturing capabilities. The Company provides solutions and adds value through design-in support, systems integration, prototype design and manufacturing, testing, logistics and aftermarket technical service and repair through its global infrastructure.</p>
<p>Our products include electron tubes and related components, microwave generators, subsystems used in semiconductor manufacturing and visual technology solutions. These products are used to control, switch or amplify electrical power signals, or are used as display devices in a variety of industrial, commercial, medical and communication applications.</p>
<p>The Company reports its financial performance for the following business segments: Power and Microwave Technologies ("PMT"), Green Energy Solutions ("GES"), Canvys and Healthcare. A description of the Company's business segments is provided in Note 10, Segment and Geographic Information.</p>
<p>We currently operate within the following major geographic regions: North America, Asia/Pacific, Europe and Latin America.</p>
<p>Customer Concentration: No one customer represented more than 10 percent of our total accounts receivable balance as of June 1, 2024. One customer represented 20 percent of our total accounts receivable balance as of May 27, 2023. No one customer represented more than 10 percent of the consolidated net sales in fiscal 2024. Sales to one customer in our PMT segment totaled $31.2 million, which accounted for 12 percent of the Company's consolidated net sales in fiscal 2023. No one customer represented more than 10 percent of the consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022.</p>
<p>Supplier Concentration: Two of our suppliers each represented 11 percent of our total cost of sales in fiscal 2024. One supplier represented 11 percent in fiscal 2023 and in fiscal 2022. The amount owed to both suppliers for fiscal 2024 totaled $3.8 million as of June 1, 2024. The amount owed for fiscal 2023 totaled $0.2 million as of May 27, 2023.</p>
<h2>2.BASIS OF PRESENTATION</h2>
<p>The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for all fiscal years presented. The consolidated financial statements include our wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and account balances have been eliminated in consolidation.</p>
<p>Our fiscal year 2024 began on May 28, 2023 and ended on June 1, 2024, our fiscal year 2023 began on May 29, 2022 and ended on May 27, 2023 and our fiscal year 2022 began on May 30, 2021 and ended on May 28, 2022. Unless otherwise noted, all references to a particular year in this document shall mean the fiscal year for such period.</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<h2>3.SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES</h2>
<p>Use of Estimates: The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management continuously evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates, including the allowance for credit losses, revenue recognition, inventory obsolescence, intangible assets, loss contingencies and income taxes. Management bases the estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, however, actual results could differ from those estimates.</p>
<p>Cash and Cash Equivalents: We consider short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash, and so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates, and that have a maturity of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximate the fair market value of these assets.</p>
<p>Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses: Trade accounts receivable represent amounts billed to customers and not yet collected. Trade accounts receivable is recorded at the invoiced amount, which approximates net recoverable value, and generally do not bear interest. The Company's accounts receivable, net balance was $24.8 million and $30.1 million as of June 1, 2024 and May 27, 2023, respectively. Our allowance for credit losses includes estimated losses that result from uncollectible receivables. The estimates are influenced by the following: continuing credit evaluation of customers' financial conditions; aging of receivables, individually and in the aggregate; a large number of customers which are widely dispersed across geographic areas; and collectability and delinquency history by geographic area. Significant changes in one or more of these considerations may require adjustments affecting net income and net carrying value of accounts receivable. The allowance for credit losses was approximately $0.3 million as of June 1, 2024, and $0.2 million as of May 27, 2023.</p>
<p>Loss Contingencies: We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. If we determine that there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred, we will include a disclosure describing the contingency.</p>
<p>Revenue Recognition: Our customers are generally not resellers, but rather businesses that incorporate our products into their processes from which they generate an economic benefit. The goods are also distinct in that each item sold to the customer is clearly identified on both the purchase order and resulting invoice. Each product we sell benefits the customer independently of the other products. Each item on each purchase order from the customer can be used by the customer unrelated to any other products we provide to the customer.</p>
<p>The Company's revenue includes the following streams:</p>
<ul>
<li>·Manufacturing /assembly</li>
<li>·Distribution</li>
<li>·Services revenue</li>
</ul>
<p>Manufacturing/assembly typically includes the products that are manufactured or assembled in our manufacturing facility. These products can either be built to the customer's prints/designs or are products that we stock in our warehouse to sell to any customer that places an order. The manufacturing business does not include a separate service bundled with the product sold or sold in addition to the product. Our contracts for customized products generally include termination provisions if a customer cancels its order. However, we recognize revenue at a point in time because the termination provisions normally do not require, upon cancellation, the customer to pay fees that are commensurate with the work performed. Each purchase order explicitly states the goods or service that we promise to transfer to the customer. The promises to the customer are limited only to those goods or service. The performance obligation is our promise to deliver both goods that were produced by the Company and resale of goods that we purchase from our suppliers. Our shipping and handling activities for destination shipments are performed prior to the customer obtaining control. As such, they are not a separate promised service. The Company elects to account for</p>
<p>shipping and handling as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the goods. The goods we provide to our customers are distinct in that our customers benefit from the goods we sell them through use in their own processes.</p>
<p>Distribution typically includes products purchased from our suppliers, stocked in our warehouses and then sold to our customers. The distribution business does not include a separate service bundled with the product sold or sold on top of the product. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers, which is simultaneous with the title transferring to the customer, in an amount that reflects the transaction price consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods. Control refers to the ability of the customer to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of, the remaining benefits from the goods. Our transaction price consideration is fixed, unless otherwise disclosed below as variable consideration. Generally, our contracts require our customers to pay for goods after we deliver products to them. Terms are generally on open account, payable net 30 days in North America, and vary throughout Asia/Pacific, Europe and Latin America subject to customary credit checks.</p>
<p>Repair, installation or training activities generate services revenue. The services we provide are relatively short in duration and are typically completed in one or two weeks. Therefore, at each reporting date, the amount of unbilled work is insignificant. The services revenue has consistently accounted for less than 5% of the Company's total revenues and is expected to continue at that level.</p>
<p>We record discounts taken based on historical experience. The policy varies by business unit. The Company allows returns with prior written authorization. We estimate returns based on historical experience. The Company maintains a reserve for returns based on historical trends that cover all contracts and revenue streams using the expected value method because we have a large number of contracts with similar characteristics, which is considered variable consideration. The reserve for returns creates a refund liability on our balance sheet as a contra trade accounts receivable as well as an asset in inventory. We value the inventory at cost due to there being minimal or no costs to the Company as we generally require the customer to pay freight and we typically do not have costs associated with activities such as relabeling or repackaging. The reserve is considered immaterial at each balance sheet date. Returns for defective product are typically covered by our suppliers' warranty, thus, returns for defective product are not factored into our reserve.</p>
<p>Principal versus agent guidance was considered for customized products that are provided by our suppliers versus manufactured by the Company. The Company acts as the principal as we are responsible for satisfying the performance obligation. We have primary responsibility for fulfilling the contract, we have inventory risk prior to delivery to our customer, we establish prices, our consideration is not in the form of a commission and we bear the credit risk. The Company recognizes revenue in the gross amount of consideration.</p>
<h2>Contracts with customers</h2>
<p>A revenue contract exists once a customer purchase order is received, reviewed and accepted. Each accepted purchase order identifies a distinct good or service as the performance obligation. The goods include standard products purchased from a supplier and stocked on our shelves, customized products purchased from a supplier, products that are customized or have value added to them in house prior to shipping to the customer and manufactured products. Prior to accepting a customer purchase order, we review the credit worthiness of the customer. Purchase orders are deemed to meet the collectability criterion once the customer's credit is approved. The Company receives advance payments or deposits from our customers before revenue is recognized resulting in contract liabilities. Contract liabilities are included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.</p>

<p>See Note 10, Segment and Geographic Information, for a disaggregation of revenue by reportable segment and geographic region, which represents how our chief operating decision maker reviews information internally to evaluate our financial performance and to make resource allocation and other decisions for the Company.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency Translation: The functional currency is the local currency at all foreign locations, with the exception of Hong Kong, where the functional currency is the U.S. dollar. Balance sheet items for our foreign entities, included in our consolidated balance sheets, are translated into U.S. dollars at end-ofperiod spot rates. Gains and losses resulting from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are credited or charged directly to accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders' equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at the current rate on the date of the transaction. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in income. Foreign exchange loss reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income were $0.4 million, $0.3 million and $0.3 million during fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively.</p>
<p>Shipping and Handling Fees and Costs: Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are reported as revenue and the related costs are reported as a component of cost of sales.</p>
<p>Inventories, net: Our consolidated inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value, generally using a weighted-average cost method. Our net inventories include approximately $93.9 million of finished goods, $12.2 million of raw materials and $4.0 million of work-in-progress as of June 1, 2024 as compared to approximately $93.4 million of finished goods, $11.8 million of raw materials and $5.2 million of work-in-progress as of May 27, 2023.</p>
<p>Provisions for obsolete or slow-moving inventories are recorded based upon regular analysis of stock rotation privileges, obsolescence, the exiting of certain markets and assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If future demand changes in the industry or market conditions differ from management's estimates, additional provisions may be necessary. The inventory reserve as of June 1, 2024 was $6.0 million compared to $5.9 million as of May 27, 2023.</p>
<p>We recorded provisions to our inventory reserves of $0.6 million, $0.5 million and $0.5 million during fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively, which were included in cost of sales. The provisions were primarily for obsolete and slow-moving parts. The parts were written down to estimated realizable value.</p>
<p>Income Taxes: We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and determine the need for a valuation allowance based on a number of factors, including both positive and negative evidence. These factors include historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income or loss, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies. In circumstances where we, or any of our affiliates, have incurred three years of cumulative losses which constitute significant negative evidence, positive evidence of equal or greater significance is needed to overcome the negative evidence before a tax benefit is recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards.</p>
<p>Intangible Assets: Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined by quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives either on a straight-line basis or over their projected future cash flows and are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment. Amortization is classified as a selling, general and administrative expense ("SG&amp;A") on the income statement. Our intangible assets represent the fair value for trade name, customer relationships, noncompete agreements and technology acquired in connection with the acquisitions.</p>
<p>Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Improvements and replacements are capitalized while expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Provisions for depreciation are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. Depreciation is classified as a selling, general and administrative expense ("SG&amp;A") on the income statement. The depreciation expense was approximately $4.0 million, $3.4 million and $3.2 million during fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively.</p>

<p>We review property and equipment, definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets for impairment whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable.</p>
<p>If adverse events do occur, our impairment review is based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis at the lowest level at which cash flows of the long-lived assets are largely independent of other groups of our assets and liabilities. This analysis requires management judgment with respect to changes in technology, the continued success of product lines and future volume, revenue and expense growth rates. We conduct annual reviews for idle and underutilized equipment and review business plans for possible impairment. Impairment occurs when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be earned by the use of the asset or asset group. When impairment is indicated, the estimated future cash flows are then discounted to determine the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group and an impairment charge is recorded when the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value.</p>
<p>Additionally, we also evaluate the remaining useful life of each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of depreciation or amortization. If the estimate of a long-lived asset's remaining useful life is changed, the remaining carrying amount of the asset is amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life.</p>

<p>Warranties: We offer assurance-type warranties for the limited number of specific products we manufacture.</p>
<p>We estimate the cost to perform under the warranty obligation and recognize this estimated cost at the time of the related product sale. We record expense related to our warranty obligations as cost of sales in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Each quarter, we assess actual warranty costs incurred on a product-by-product basis and compare the warranty costs to our estimated warranty obligation. With respect to new products, estimates are based generally on knowledge of the products and warranty experience.</p>
<p>Warranty reserves are established for costs that are expected to be incurred after the sale and delivery of products under warranty. Warranty reserves are included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The warranty reserves are determined based on known product failures, historical experience and other available evidence.</p>

<p>Other Non-Current Liabilities: Other non-current liabilities of $0.8 million at June 1, 2024 and $0.6 million at May 27, 2023, primarily represent employee-benefits obligations in various non-U.S. locations.</p>
<p>Share-Based Compensation: We measure and recognize share-based compensation cost at fair value for all share-based payments, including stock options and restricted stock awards. We estimate fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires assumptions such as expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected life and dividends. We account for the forfeitures of stock-based compensation in the period in which they occur. Compensation cost is recognized using a graded vesting schedule over the applicable vesting period. Share-based compensation expense totaled approximately $1.3 million during fiscal 2024, $0.9 million during fiscal 2023 and $0.7 million during fiscal 2022.</p>

<p>There were 74,822 stock options exercised during fiscal 2024, with cash received of $0.6 million. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $0.3 million during fiscal 2024, $4.7 million during fiscal 2023 and $1.9 million for fiscal 2022. The weighted average fair value of stock option grants was $6.33 during fiscal 2024, $5.44 during fiscal 2023 and $1.50 during fiscal 2022. As of June 1, 2024, total unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock options and restricted stock awards was approximately $2.5 million, which is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average period of approximately two to four years. The total grant date fair value of stock options vested during fiscal 2024 was $0.5 million.</p>
<p>The fair value of stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:</p>

<p>The expected volatility assumptions are based on historical experience commensurate with the expected term. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a treasury note with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the stock option. The expected term of stock options is estimated from the vesting period of the award and represents the weighted average period that our stock options are expected to be outstanding. For stock options granted during fiscal 2022 the simplified method was used as we believed that our historical stock option experience did not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term.</p>

<p>Compensation effects arising from issuing stock awards have been charged against income and recorded as additional paid-in-capital in the consolidated statements of stockholders' equity during fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022.</p>
<p>The Employees' Amended and Restated 2011 Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan (the "Plan") authorizes the issuance of up to 3,500,000 shares as incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options or stock awards. Under this plan, 756,000 shares are reserved for future issuance. The Plan authorizes the granting of stock options at the fair market value at the date of grant. Generally, these options become exercisable over five years and expire up to 10 years from the date of grant. Restricted stock awards vest on the anniversary of the grant date in three equal installments.</p>
<p>Earnings per Share: We have authorized 17,000,000 shares of common stock and 3,000,000 shares of Class B common stock. The Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and has transferability restrictions; however, Class B common stock may be converted into common stock on a share-for-share basis at any time. With respect to dividends and distributions, shares of common stock and Class B common stock rank equally and have the same rights, except that Class B common stock cash dividends are limited to 90% of the amount of Class A common stock cash dividends.</p>
<p>Our Class B common stock is considered a participating security requiring the use of the two-class method for the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share. The two-class computation method for each period reflects the cash dividends paid per share for each class of stock, plus the amount of allocated undistributed earnings per share computed using the participation percentage which reflects the dividend rights of each class of stock. Basic and diluted earnings per share were computed using the two-class method. The shares of Class B common stock are considered to be participating convertible securities since the shares of Class B common stock are convertible on a share-for-share basis into shares of common stock and may participate in dividends with common stock according to a predetermined formula which is 90% of the amount of Class A common stock cash dividends.</p>
<p>The allocation of undistributed (loss) earnings between common stock and Class B common stock is based on the relationship of the weighted shares outstanding for the respective stock class (common or Class B) to the total</p>
<p>of the weighted shares outstanding for common stock and 90% of the weighted shares outstanding for Class B common stock. The adjustment to the number of outstanding Class B common stock shares reflects the limitation of Class B common stock dividends to 90% of common stock dividends.</p>

<h2>New Accounting Pronouncements - Adopted</h2>
<p>ASU 2016-13 (as amended by ASU 2018-19, ASU 2019-04, ASU 2019-05, ASU 2019-10, ASU 2019-11 and 2020-02) introduced a new forward-looking approach, based on expected losses, to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables. The estimate of expected credit losses requires entities to incorporate considerations of historical information, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This ASU also expanded the disclosure requirements to enable users of financial statements to understand the entity's assumptions, models and methods for estimating expected credit losses. The Company adopted the new standard on May 28, 2023 and the adoption had no impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.</p>
<h2>New Accounting Pronouncements - Not Yet Adopted</h2>
<p>In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2023-09 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which expands the disclosures required in an entity's income tax rate reconciliation table and requires disclosure of income taxes paid in both U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,</p>
<p>2024, with early adoption permitted, to be applied on a prospective basis, with retrospective application permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company's disclosures.</p>
<p>In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amendment requires disclosures of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items, and interim disclosures of a reportable segment's profit or loss and assets. The new guidance also requires that a public entity that has a single reportable segment provide all the disclosures required by the amendments in this update and all existing segment disclosures. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, this guidance should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented. The Company is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company's disclosures.</p>
<p>In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC") Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative. The amendments in this update require modification of certain disclosure and presentation requirements for a variety of ASU topics in response to the SEC's Release No. 33-10532. The effective date for each amended topic in the ASC is the date on which the SEC's removal of the related disclosure requirement from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective. However, if by June 30, 2027, the SEC has not removed the related disclosure from its regulations, the amendment will be removed from the Codification and not become effective. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company's disclosures.</p>
<h2>4.REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY</h2>
<p>The Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") for a three-year Revolving Credit Facility with PNC Bank N.A. on March 20, 2023 (the "Revolving Credit Facility"). The Revolving Credit Facility will mature on March 20, 2026. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, including the swingline loan and letter of credit sub-facility extended to the Company thereunder, are secured by (i) a continuing first priority lien on and security interest in and to substantially all of the assets of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries and (ii) a continuing first priority pledge of the Pledged Collateral of the Company and the Guarantors identified in the Security Agreement and the Pledge Agreement executed in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility. The combined maximum borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are $30 million. Proceeds of borrowings may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. There was no amount outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of June 1, 2024 .</p>
<p>The Credit Agreement provides that the Company must maintain compliance with a maximum consolidated leverage ratio covenant and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, each as determined in accordance with the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type, including, among other things, limitations on certain other indebtedness, loans and investments, liens, mergers, asset sales, and transactions with affiliates, as well as customary events of default for financings of this type. The Company was in compliance with financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as of June 1, 2024.</p>
<p>Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate per annum selected by the Company from the following options: (a) Term SOFR Rate (for the applicable Interest Period) plus the SOFR Adjustment (for the applicable Interest Period) plus 1.25%; (b) Base Rate plus 0.25% or (c) Daily Simple RFR (for Euros) plus the RFR Adjustment plus 1.25%. Letters of credit issued under the letter of credit sub-facility will have a letter of credit fee equal to 1.25% per annum. The fee for the unused portion of the credit line is 0.10%.</p>
<h2>5. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION</h2>
<p>On June 15, 2015, the Company entered into a lease agreement for the IMES facility with LDL, LLC. That lease agreement was extended for five years in fiscal 2021. The Company is entitled to extend the term of the lease for an additional five-year renewal term by notifying the landlord in writing of its intention to do so within six months of the expiration of the term. The Executive Vice President of IMES, Lee A. McIntyre III (former owner of IMES), had an ownership interest in LDL, LLC. Mr. McIntyre departed from the Company in fiscal year 2023, effective as of</p>
<p>September 24, 2022. The lease agreement provides for monthly payments over five years with total future minimum lease payments of $0.2 million. Rental expense related to this lease amounted to $0.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2024, $0.2 million for the fiscal year ended May 27, 2023 and $0.2 million for the fiscal year ended May 28, 2022.</p>
<h2>6. INTANGIBLE ASSETS</h2>
<p>Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined by quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or recognized valuation models. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives and are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment. No impairment was recognized in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 or fiscal 2022.</p>
<p>Our intangible assets represent the fair value for customer relationships and technology acquired in connection with our acquisitions. Intangible assets subject to amortization were as follows (in thousands) :</p>

<p>During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company recorded R&amp;D tax credits of $0.5 million. These credits represent the expected U.S. federal credits to be claimed for fiscal 2024.</p>
<p>Net deferred tax assets related to domestic state NOL carryforwards at June 1, 2024 amounted to approximately $1.8 million, compared to $2.1 million at May 27, 2023. Net deferred tax assets related to foreign NOL carryforwards was $0.1 million as of June 1, 2024, and $0.2 million as of May 27, 2023 with various or indefinite expiration dates. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 we increased the valuation allowance on the state net operating losses by $0.9 million resulting in a total valuation allowance against state net operating losses of $1.1 million.</p>
<p>We have historically determined that undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, to the extent of cash available, will be repatriated to the U.S. The deferred tax liability on the outside basis difference is now primarily withholding tax on future dividend distributions. The deferred tax liability related to undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries was less than $0.1 million in both fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023.</p>
<p>Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to support a more likely than not assertion that its deferred tax assets will be realized. A significant component of objective evidence evaluated was the cumulative income or loss incurred in each jurisdiction over the three-year period ended June 1, 2024. We considered other positive evidence in determining the need for a valuation allowance in the U.S. including the subpart F and GILTI inclusions of our foreign earnings, the changes in our business performance in recent years, and the utilization of federal NOLs. The weight of this positive evidence is sufficient to outweigh other negative evidence in evaluating our need for a valuation allowance in the U.S. federal jurisdiction. As of June 1, 2024, we recorded a $0.9 million valuation allowance on state NOLs as there was more</p>
<p>negative evidence which limited the Company's ability to utilize the state NOLs, including the anticipated expiration of some state NOLs prior to utilization and legislation restrictions for some states.</p>
<p>As of June 1, 2024, a valuation allowance of $2.1 million was recorded, representing the portion of the deferred tax asset that management does not believe is more likely than not to be realized. The valuation allowance as of May 27, 2023, was $1.4 million. The valuation allowance relates to state NOLs ($1.1 million) and deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions where historical taxable losses have been incurred ($1.0 million). The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are increased, or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.</p>
<p>Income taxes paid, net of refunds, including foreign estimated tax payments, were less than $0.1 million, $4.8 million and $1.5 million, during fiscal 2024, fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively.</p>
<p>In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. Years prior to fiscal 2015 are closed for examination under the statute of limitation for U.S. federal and U.S. state. In the Netherlands, years prior to fiscal 2019 are closed for examination. We are under examination in Germany for fiscal years 2019 to 2022. We have no current open audits in the U.S.</p>
<p>The Company recorded a $0.1 million uncertain tax position as of June 1, 2024 as compared to not recording an uncertain tax position as of May 27, 2023. We record interest related to uncertain tax positions in the income tax expense line item within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Accrued interest was included within the related tax liability line in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have recorded a liability of less than $0.1 million for interest as of June 1, 2024.</p>

<h2>ITEM 9. Changes in and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosures</h2>
<p>None .</p>
<h2>ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures</h2>
<h2>(a)Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures</h2>
<p>Management of the Company, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) as of June 1, 2024.</p>
<p>Disclosure controls and procedures are intended to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company's Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 1, 2024, at a reasonable assurance level.</p>
<h2>(b)Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting</h2>
<p>The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</p>
<p>Under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 1, 2024, based on the framework in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ("COSO"). Based on that assessment, management has concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of June 1, 2024.</p>
<p>Management's assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of June 1, 2024, has been audited by BDO USA, P.C., an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.</p>
<h2>(c)Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting</h2>
<p>There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.</p>
<h2>Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm</h2>
<p>Stockholders and Board of Directors Richardson Electronics, Ltd. LaFox, Illinois</p>
<h2>Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting</h2>
<p>We have audited Richardson Electronics Ltd.'s (the "Company's") internal control over financial reporting as of June 1, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the "COSO criteria"). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 1, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.</p>
<p>We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB"), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of June 1, 2024 and May 27, 2023, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 1, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated August 5, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.</p>
<h2>Basis for Opinion</h2>
<p>The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Item 9A, Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.</p>
<p>We conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<h2>Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting</h2>
<p>A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.</p>
<p>Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.</p>
