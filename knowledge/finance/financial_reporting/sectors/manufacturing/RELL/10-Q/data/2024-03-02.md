<h2>2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION</h2>
<p>The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.</p>
<p>Our fiscal quarter ends on the Saturday nearest the end of the quarter-ending month. The third quarter of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023 both contained 13 weeks. The first nine months of fiscal 2024 contained 40 weeks and the first nine months of fiscal 2023 contained 39 weeks.</p>
<p>In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of interim periods have been made. All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated. The unaudited consolidated financial statements presented herein include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to applicable rules and regulations. The results of our operations for nine months ended March 2, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending June 1, 2024.</p>
<p>As described in Note 1, Description of the Company and Note 9, Segment Reporting , the Company reports its financial performance based on four operating and reportable segments. The financial information contained in this report should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 27, 2023, which was filed with the SEC on July 31, 2023.</p>
<h2>3. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS</h2>
<p>ASU 2016-13 (as amended by ASU 2018-19, ASU 2019-04, ASU 2019-05, ASU 2019-10, ASU 2019-11 and 2020-02) introduced a new forward-looking approach, based on expected losses, to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments, including trade receivables. The estimate of expected credit losses requires entities to incorporate considerations of historical information, current information and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This ASU also expanded the disclosure requirements to enable users of financial statements to understand the entity's assumptions, models and methods for estimating expected credit losses. The Company adopted the new standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and the adoption had no impact on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.</p>
<p>In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2023-09 Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which expands the disclosures required in an entity's income tax rate reconciliation table and requires disclosure of income taxes paid in both U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted, to be applied on a prospective basis, with retrospective application permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company's disclosures.</p>
<p>In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amendment requires disclosures of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") and included within each reported measure of segment profit of loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items, and interim disclosures of a reportable segment's profit or loss and assets. The new guidance also requires that a public entity that has a single reportable segment provide all the disclosures required by the amendments in this update and all existing segment disclosures. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, this guidance should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented. The Company is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company's disclosures.</p>
<p>In October 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-06, Disclosure Improvements: Codification Amendments in Response to the Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC") Disclosure Update and Simplification Initiative. The amendments in this update require modification of certain disclosure and presentation requirements for a variety of ASU topics in response to the SEC's Release No. 33-10532. The effective date for each amended topic in the ASC is the date on which the SEC's removal of the related disclosure requirement from Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K becomes effective. However, if by June 30, 2027, the SEC has not removed the related disclosure from its regulations, the amendment will be removed from the Codification and not become effective. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company's disclosures.</p>
<h2>4. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES</h2>
<p>Inventories, net: Our consolidated inventories were stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value, generally using a weighted-average cost method. Our net inventories include approximately $95.1 million of finished goods, $12.9 million of raw materials and $4.6 million of work-in-progress as of March 2, 2024, as compared to approximately $93.4 million of finished goods, $11.8 million of raw materials and $5.2 million of work-in-progress as of May 27, 2023.</p>
<p>At this time, we do not anticipate any material risks or uncertainties related to possible future inventory write-downs. Provisions for obsolete or slow-moving inventories are recorded based upon regular analysis of stock rotation privileges, obsolescence, the exiting of certain markets and assumptions about future demand and market conditions. If future demand changes in the industry, or market conditions differ from management's estimates, additional provisions may be necessary. Inventory reserves were approximately $6.0 million as of March 2, 2024 and $5.9 million as of May 27, 2023.</p>
<p>Revenue Recognition: Our customers are generally not resellers, but rather businesses that incorporate our products into their processes, from which they generate an economic benefit. The goods are also distinct in that each item sold to the customer is clearly identified on both the purchase order and resulting invoice. Each product we sell benefits the customer independently of the other products. Each item on each purchase order from the customer can be used by the customer unrelated to any other products we provide to the customer. The Company's revenue includes the following streams:</p>
<ul>
<li>·Manufacturing/assembly</li>
<li>·Distribution</li>
<li>·Services revenue</li>
</ul>
<p>Manufacturing/assembly typically includes the products that are manufactured or assembled in our manufacturing facility. These products can either be built to the customer's prints/designs or are products that we stock in our warehouse to sell to any customer that places an order. The manufacturing business does not include a separate service bundled with the product sold or sold in addition to the product. Our contracts for customized products generally include termination provisions if a customer cancels its order. However, we recognize revenue at a point in time because the termination provisions normally do not require, upon cancellation, the customer to pay fees that are commensurate with the work performed. Each purchase order explicitly states the goods or services that we promise to transfer to the customer. The promises to the customer are limited only to those goods or services. The performance obligation is our promise to deliver both goods that were produced by the Company and resale of goods that we purchase from our suppliers. Our shipping and handling activities for destination shipments are performed prior to the customer obtaining control. As such, they are not a separate promised service. The Company elects to account for shipping and handling as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the goods. The goods we provide to our customers are distinct in that our customers benefit from the goods we sell them through use in their own processes.</p>
<p>Distribution typically includes products purchased from our suppliers, stocked in our warehouses and then sold to our customers. The distribution business does not include a separate service bundled with the product sold or sold on top of the product. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers, which is simultaneous with the title transferring to the customer, in an amount that reflects the transaction price consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods. Control refers to the ability of the customer to direct the use of and obtain substantially all the remaining benefits from the goods. Our transaction price consideration is fixed, unless otherwise disclosed below as variable consideration. Generally, our contracts require our customers to pay for goods after we deliver products to them. Terms are generally on open account, payable net 30 days in North America, and vary throughout Asia/Pacific, Europe and Latin America subject to customary credit checks.</p>
<p>Repair, installation or training activities generate services revenue. The services we provide are relatively short in duration and are typically completed in one or two weeks. Therefore, at each reporting date, the amount of unbilled work is insignificant. The services revenue has consistently accounted for less than 5% of the Company's total revenues and is expected to continue at that level.</p>
<p>Contracts with customers: A revenue contract exists once a customer purchase order is received, reviewed and accepted. Each accepted purchase order identifies a distinct good or service as the Company's performance obligation. The goods include standard products purchased from a supplier and stocked on our shelves, customized products purchased from a supplier, products that are customized or have value added to them in house prior to shipping to the customer and manufactured products. Prior to accepting a customer purchase order, we review the credit worthiness of the customer. Purchase orders are deemed to meet the collectability criterion once the customer's credit is approved. The Company receives advance payments or deposits from our customers before revenue is recognized resulting in contract liabilities. Contract liabilities are included in accrued liabilities in the unaudited consolidated balance sheets.</p>

<p>See Note 9, Segment Reporting, for a disaggregation of revenue by reportable segment and geographic region, which represents how our chief operating decision maker reviews information internally to evaluate our financial performance and to make resource allocation and other decisions for the Company.</p>
<p>Loss Contingencies: We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. If we determine that there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred, we will include a disclosure describing the contingency.</p>
<p>Intangible Assets: Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined by quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or by recognized valuation models. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives either on a straight-line basis or over their projected future cash flows and are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment. Our intangible assets represent the fair value for customer relationships agreements acquired in connection with prior acquisitions. Technology represents the fair value acquired in connection with acquisitions and an exclusive license, manufacturing and distribution agreement. Intangible assets subject to amortization were as follows (in thousands) :</p>

<p>The weighted average number of years of amortization expense remaining is 10.4 years.</p>
<p>Income Taxes: We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and determine the need for a valuation allowance based on a number of factors, including both positive and negative evidence. These factors include historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income or loss, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies. In circumstances where we, or any of our affiliates, have incurred three years of cumulative losses which constitute significant negative evidence, positive evidence of equal or greater significance is needed to overcome the negative evidence before a tax benefit is recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards.</p>

<p>Warranties: We offer assurance type warranties for the limited number of specific products we manufacture. We estimate the cost to perform under the warranty obligation and recognize this estimated cost at the time of the related product sale. We record expense related to our warranty obligations as cost of sales in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Each quarter, we assess actual warranty costs incurred on a product-by-product basis and compare the warranty costs to our estimated warranty obligation. With respect to new products, estimates are based generally on knowledge of the products and warranty experience.</p>
<p>Warranty reserves are established for costs that are expected to be incurred after the sale and delivery of products under warranty. Warranty reserves are included in accrued liabilities on our unaudited consolidated balance sheets. The warranty reserves are determined based on known product failures, historical experience and other available evidence. Warranty reserves were approximately $0.7 million as of March 2, 2024 and May 27, 2023.</p>
<h2>5. REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY</h2>
<p>The Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") for a three-year Revolving Credit Facility with PNC Bank N.A. on March 20, 2023 (the "Revolving Credit Facility"). The Revolving Credit Facility will mature on March 20, 2026. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, including the swingline loan and letter of credit sub-facility extended to the Company thereunder, are secured by (i) a continuing first priority lien on and security interest in and to substantially all of the assets of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries and (ii) a continuing first priority pledge of the Pledged Collateral of the Company and the Guarantors identified in the Security Agreement and the Pledge Agreement executed in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility. The combined maximum borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are $30 million. Proceeds of borrowings may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Company utilized $3.7 million of the credit line to address short-term working capital needs and repaid that $3.7 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. There was no amount outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility as of March 2, 2024 .</p>
<p>The Credit Agreement provides that the Company must maintain compliance with a maximum consolidated leverage ratio covenant and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, each as determined in accordance with the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type, including, among other things, limitations on certain other indebtedness, loans and investments, liens, mergers, asset sales, and transactions with affiliates, as well as customary events of default for financings of this type. The Company was in compliance with financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as of March 2, 2024.</p>
<p>Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate per annum selected by the Company from the following options: (a) Term SOFR Rate (for the applicable Interest Period) plus the SOFR Adjustment (for the applicable Interest Period) plus 1.25%; (b) Base Rate plus 0.25% or (c) Daily Simple RFR (for Euros) plus the RFR Adjustment plus 1.25%. Letters of credit issued under the letter of credit sub-facility will have a letter of credit fee equal to 1.25% per annum. The fee for the unused portion of the credit line is 0.10%.</p>
<h2>6. LEASE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS</h2>
<p>The Company leases real and personal property in the normal course of business under various operating leases. The Company uses operating leases for facility space and automobiles. Most of the leased facility space is for sales and general office use. Automobile leases are used throughout the Company.</p>
<p>The Company did not capitalize short-term leases for all asset classes defined as leases with a term of shorter than twelve months on the balance sheet. These leases have not been transitioned to ASC 842. As a practical expedient, the Company did not reassess the accounting for initial direct costs of current leases.</p>
<p>Several leases include renewal clauses which vary in length and may not include specific rent renewal amounts. The Company will revise the value of the right of use assets and associated lease liabilities upon a remeasurement event.</p>

<h2>7. INCOME TAXES</h2>
<p>We recorded an income tax provision of $0.1 million and $5.3 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and the first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively. The effective income tax rate during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was a tax provision of 39.2% as compared to a tax provision of 22.5% during the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The difference in rate during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023 reflects changes in our geographical distribution of income, which is primarily driven by a decrease in U.S. earnings for fiscal 2024 and the state income tax provision, as well as the U.S. research and development credits. The 39.2% effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% as a result of our geographical distribution of income, which is primarily driven by a decrease in U.S. earnings for fiscal 2024, state income tax provision and the U.S. research and development credit.</p>
<p>In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. Generally, years prior to fiscal 2019 are closed for examination under the statute of limitation for U.S. federal, U.S. state and local or non-U.S. tax jurisdictions. Our primary foreign tax jurisdictions are Germany and the Netherlands. We have tax years open in Germany beginning in fiscal 2019 and the Netherlands beginning in fiscal 2021.</p>
<p>We have historically determined that certain undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, to the extent of cash available, will be repatriated to the U.S. The deferred tax liability on the outside basis difference is primarily withholding tax on future dividend distributions. The deferred tax liability related to undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries was less than $0.1 million as of March 2, 2024 and May 27, 2023.</p>
<p>The Company did not have any uncertain tax positions as of March 2, 2024 and May 27, 2023. We record penalties and interest related to uncertain tax positions in the income tax expense line item within the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss when applicable.</p>
<p>The Company maintains a valuation allowance representing the portion of the deferred tax asset that management does not believe is more likely than not to be realized. The valuation allowance was $1.4 million as of March 2, 2024 and May 27, 2023. The current valuation allowance deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions where historical taxable losses have been incurred ($1.2 million) and state NOLs ($0.2 million). The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are increased, or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.</p>
<h2>8. CALCULATION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE</h2>
<p>We have authorized 17,000,000 shares of common stock and 3,000,000 shares of Class B common stock. The Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and has transferability restrictions; however, Class B common stock may be converted into common stock on a share-for-share basis at any time. With respect to dividends and distributions, shares of common stock and Class B common stock rank equally and have the same rights, except that Class B common stock cash dividends are limited to 90% of the amount of common stock cash dividends.</p>
<p>Our Class B common stock is considered a participating security requiring the use of the two-class method for the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share. The two-class computation method for each period reflects the cash dividends paid per share for each class of stock, plus the amount of allocated undistributed (loss) earnings per share computed using the participation percentage which reflects the dividend rights of each class of stock. Basic and diluted earnings per share were computed using the two-class method. The shares of Class B common stock are considered to be participating convertible securities since the shares of Class B common stock are convertible on a share-for-share basis into shares of common stock and may participate in dividends with common stock according to a predetermined formula which is 90% of the amount of common stock cash dividends.</p>
<p>The allocation of undistributed (loss) earnings between common stock and Class B common stock is based on the relationship of the weighted shares outstanding for the respective stock class (common or Class B) to the total of the weighted shares outstanding for common stock and 90% of the weighted shares outstanding for Class B common stock. The adjustment to the number of outstanding Class B common stock shares reflects the limitation of Class B common stock dividends to 90% of common stock dividends.</p>
<p>The earnings per share ("EPS") presented in our unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income was based on the following amounts ( in thousands, except per share amounts ):</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&amp;A") is intended to assist the reader in better understanding our business, results of operations, financial condition, changes in financial condition and significant developments. MD&amp;A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this filing. This section is organized as follows:</p>
<h2>· Business Overview</h2>
<ul>
<li>· Results of Operations - an analysis and comparison of our consolidated results of operations for the three and nine-month periods ended March 2, 2024 and February 25, 2023, as reflected in our unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income.</li>
<li>· Liquidity, Financial Position and Capital Resources - a discussion of our primary sources and uses of cash for the nine-month periods ended March 2, 2024 and February 25, 2023, and a discussion of changes in our financial position.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Business Overview</h2>
<p>Richardson Electronics, Ltd. (the "Company", "we", "our") is a leading global manufacturer of engineered solutions, power grid and microwave tubes and related consumables; power conversion and RF and microwave components; high-value replacement parts, tubes and service training for diagnostic imaging equipment; and customized display solutions. Nearly 55% of our products are manufactured at our facilities located in LaFox, Illinois, Marlborough, Massachusetts and Donaueschingen, Germany, or by one of our manufacturing partners throughout the world. All our partners manufacture to our strict specifications and per our supplier code of conduct. We serve customers in the alternative energy, healthcare, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific and semiconductor markets. The Company's strategy is to provide specialized technical expertise and "engineered solutions" based on our core engineering and manufacturing capabilities. The Company provides solutions and adds value through design-in support, systems integration, prototype design and manufacturing, testing, logistics and aftermarket technical service and repair through its global infrastructure.</p>
<p>Some of the Company's products are manufactured in China and are imported into the United States. The Office of the United States Trade Representative ("USTR") instituted additional 10% to 25% tariffs on the importation of a number of products into the United States from China effective July 6, 2018, with additional products added August 23, 2018 and September 24, 2018. These additional tariffs are a response to what the USTR considers to be certain unfair trade practices by China. A number of the Company's products manufactured in China are now subject to these additional duties of 25% when imported into the United States.</p>
<p>Management continues to work with suppliers and customers to mitigate the impact of the tariffs in our markets. However, if the Company is unable to successfully pass through the additional cost of these tariffs, or if the higher prices reduce demand for the Company's products, it will have a negative effect on the Company's sales and gross margins.</p>
<p>The Company reports its financial performance based on the operating and reportable segments defined as follows:</p>

<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<p>During the third quarter of fiscal 2024, consolidated net sales decreased 25.6% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Sales for PMT decreased 33.4 %, sales for GES increased 0.5%, sales for Canvys decreased 32.0% and sales for Healthcare increased 29.5%. The decrease in PMT was mainly due to a cyclical downturn in the semi-wafer fabrication industry. The increase in GES was mainly due to increased shipments of battery modules for wind turbine products. The decrease in Canvys was primarily due to customer pushouts in the North American market. The increase in Healthcare was primarily due to increases in parts and CT tube sales, partially offset by a decrease in equipment sales.</p>
<p>During the first nine months of fiscal 2024, consolidated net sales decreased 26.9% compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Sales for PMT decreased 26.0%, sales for GES decreased 42.6%, sales for Canvys decreased 21.2% and sales for Healthcare decreased 0.3%. The decrease in sales for PMT was mainly due to a cyclical downturn in the semi-wafer fabrication industry. The decrease in sales for GES reflected the project-based nature of this segment and was mainly due to lower shipments of battery modules for wind turbine products in the first half of the year and the completion of the EV locomotive prototype build in fiscal 2023. The decrease in sales for Canvys was primarily due to lower sales in the North American market. The decrease in sales for Healthcare was primarily due to decreases in equipment sales, partially offset by an increase in CT tube sales.</p>

<h2>Selling, General and Administrative Expenses</h2>
<p>Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&amp;A") decreased slightly to $14.4 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 when compared to $14.8 million for the year ago quarter. The decrease from the third quarter of fiscal 2023 reflected lower incentives due to financial performance partially offset by higher R&amp;D expenses. Expressed as a percentage of net sales, SG&amp;A for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 increased to 27.6% compared to 21.0% for the third quarter of fiscal 2023.</p>
<p>SG&amp;A increased $1.0 million or 2.3% to $44.7 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 when compared to the prior year. The increase from the first nine months of fiscal 2023 mainly reflected higher salaries and R&amp;D expenses, partially offset by lower incentive expense. Expressed as a percentage of net sales, SG&amp;A for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 increased to 30.0% compared to 21.4% for the first nine months of fiscal 2023.</p>
<h2>Other Income/Expense</h2>
<p>Other expense was less $0.1 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to other income of $0.4 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Other expense during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 included interest income and foreign exchange losses. Our foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily due to the translation of U.S. dollars held in non-U.S. entities. We currently do not utilize derivative instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency.</p>
<p>Other expense was $0.2 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2024, compared to other expense of $0.1 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Other expense during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 included interest income and foreign exchange losses. Our foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily due to the translation of U.S. dollars held in non-U.S. entities.</p>
<h2>Income Tax Provision</h2>
<p>We recorded an income tax provision of $0.2 million and $1.7 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and the third quarter of fiscal 2023, respectively. The effective income tax rate during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was 23.4% as compared to 20.7% during the third quarter of fiscal 2023. The difference in rate during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 reflects changes in our geographical distribution of income, which is primarily driven by a decrease in U.S. earnings for fiscal 2024 and the state income tax provision as well as the U.S. research and development credits. The 23.4% effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% as a result of our geographical distribution of income and the utilization of the U.S. research and development credit.</p>
<p>We recorded an income tax provision of $0.1 million and $5.3 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2024 and the first nine months of fiscal 2023, respectively. The effective income tax rate during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was a tax provision of 39.2% as compared to a tax provision of 22.5% during the first nine months of fiscal 2023. The difference in rate during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 as compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2023 reflects changes in our geographical distribution of income, which is primarily driven by a decrease in U.S. earnings for fiscal 2024, and the state income tax provision, as well as the U.S. research and development credits. The 39.2% effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% as a result of our geographical distribution of income, which is primarily driven by a decrease in U.S. earnings for fiscal 2024, state income tax provision and the U.S. research and development credit.</p>
<p>In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. Generally, years prior to fiscal 2019 are closed for examination under the statute of limitation for U.S. federal, U.S. state and local or non-U.S. tax jurisdictions. Our primary foreign tax jurisdictions are Germany and the Netherlands. We have tax years open in Germany beginning in fiscal 2019 and the Netherlands beginning in fiscal 2021.</p>
<p>The Company did not have any uncertain tax positions as of March 2, 2024 and May 27, 2023. We record penalties and interest related to uncertain tax positions in the income tax expense line item within the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss when applicable.</p>
<h2>Net Income and Per Share Data</h2>
<p>Net income during the third quarter of fiscal 2024 was $0.8 million, or $0.05 per diluted common share and $0.05 per Class B diluted common share as compared to net income of $6.3 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2023 or $0.44 per diluted common share and $0.40 per Class B diluted common share.</p>
<p>Net income during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was $0.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted common share and $0.01 per Class B diluted common share as compared to net income of $18.2 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 or $1.27 per diluted common share and $1.15 per Class B diluted common share.</p>
<h2>LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES</h2>
<p>Our operations and cash needs have been primarily financed through cash on hand.</p>
<p>Cash and cash equivalents were $18.9 million at March 2, 2024. Cash and cash equivalents by geographic area at March 2, 2024 consisted of $5.7 million in North America, $5.9 million in Europe, $1.0 million in Latin America and $6.3 million in Asia/Pacific. We repatriated $0.3 million to the United States in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 from our entity in Mexico. Although the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act generally eliminated federal income tax on future cash repatriation to the United States, cash repatriation may be subject to state and local taxes, withholding or similar taxes. See Note 8, Income Taxes , of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 27, 2023, filed with the SEC on July 31, 2023, for further information.</p>
<p>Cash and cash equivalents were $25.0 million on May 27, 2023. Cash and cash equivalents by geographic area on May 27, 2023 consisted of $8.1 million in North America, $8.6 million in Europe, $1.5 million in Latin America and $6.8 million in Asia/Pacific. No funds were repatriated to the United States in fiscal 2023 from our foreign entities.</p>
<p>Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from: (i) working capital requirements, (ii) capital expenditure needs and (iii) cash dividend payments (if and when declared by our Board of Directors). Our ability to fund these requirements will depend, in part, on our future cash flows, which are determined by our future operating performance and, therefore, subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.</p>
<p>Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that the existing sources of liquidity, including current cash, will provide sufficient resources to meet known capital requirements and working capital needs through the next twelve months. Additionally, while our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the economy and the outlook for growth in our markets, we believe our existing sources of liquidity as well as our ability to generate operating cash flows will satisfy our future obligations and cash requirements.</p>
<p>On March 20, 2023, the Company established a senior, secured revolving credit facility agreement with a three-year term in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $30 million, including a swingline loan and a letter of credit sub-facility (collectively, the "Revolving Credit Facility") with PNC Bank. The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by the Company's domestic subsidiaries. Proceeds of the borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are expected to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company utilized $3.7 million of the credit line to address short-term cash requirements and repaid that $3.7 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2024. As of the end of the third quarter for fiscal 2024 and the date of this report, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.</p>
<h2>Cash Flows from Operating Activities</h2>
<p>Cash flows from operating activities are primarily a result of our net income adjusted for non-cash items and changes in our operating assets and liabilities.</p>
<p>Operating activities used $0.7 million of cash during the first nine months of fiscal 2024. We had a net income of $0.2 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2024, which included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $1.0 million associated with the issuance of stock option and restricted stock awards, inventory reserve provisions of $0.5 million and depreciation and amortization expense of $3.2 million associated with our property and equipment as well as amortization of our intangible assets. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities used $5.7 million in cash during the first nine months of fiscal 2024, net of foreign currency exchange gains and losses included an increase in inventory of $2.2 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $5.2 million and an increase in prepayments of $0.1 million. Partially offsetting the cash utilization was a decrease in receivables of $1.0 million and an increase in accrued liabilities of $0.6 million. The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to the lower level of sales across our operating segments in the current quarter. Most of the inventory increase supported the products for electron tubes and Healthcare. The changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities were timing related.</p>
<p>Operating activities used $11.4 million of cash during the first nine months of fiscal 2023. We had a net income of $18.2 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2023, which included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $0.7 million associated with the issuance of stock option and restricted stock awards, inventory reserve provisions of $0.3 million and depreciation and amortization expense of $2.7 million associated with our property and equipment as well as amortization of our intangible assets. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities used $33.4 million in cash during the first nine months of fiscal 2023, net of foreign currency exchange gains and losses, included an increase in accounts receivable of $12.7 million, an increase in inventory of $21.8 million and an increase in prepaid expenses of $0.6 million. Partially offsetting the cash utilization for accounts receivable, inventory and prepaid expenses was an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $1.3 million. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to increased sales. The majority of the inventory increase supported the product growth in LaFox manufacturing, Green Energy Solutions and Canvys, in addition to increases in the inventory for electron tubes. The increase in accounts payable was related to the inventory increase and the increase in accrued liabilities was timing related.</p>
<h2>Cash Flows from Investing Activities</h2>
<p>Cash used in investing activities of $3.1 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 was due to capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were primarily related to our IT system and the LaFox manufacturing and facilities renovation. LaFox manufacturing primarily supports the Electron Device Group ("EDG") and Green Energy Solutions ("GES").</p>
<p>Cash provided by investing activities of $0.2 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 was mainly due to the proceeds from investment maturities as well as proceeds from the sale of assets partially offset by capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were primarily related to our IT system, as well as our LaFox manufacturing business and facilities, which also supports both EDG and Green Energy Solutions. The Company did not have any investment purchases in the first nine months of fiscal 2023.</p>
<h2>Cash Flows from Financing Activities</h2>
<p>Cash flows used in financing activities consist primarily of cash dividends and cash flows provided by financing activities consist primarily of the proceeds from the issuance of stock. All future dividend payments are at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Dividend payments depend on earnings, capital requirements, operating conditions and such other factors that the Board may deem relevant.</p>
<p>Cash used in financing activities of $2.3 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2024 primarily resulted from $2.5 million of dividend payments to stockholders partially offset by $0.3 million of proceeds from the issuance of stock.</p>
<p>Cash provided by financing activities of $0.9 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2023 primarily resulted from the $3.4 million proceeds from the issuance of stock less the $2.5 million of dividend payments to stockholders.</p>
<h2>ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK</h2>
<h2>Risk Management and Market Sensitive Financial Instruments</h2>
<p>We are exposed to many different market risks with the various industries we serve. The primary financial risk we are exposed to is foreign currency exchange, as certain of our operations, assets and liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies. We manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities.</p>
<p>The interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in exchange rates would likely influence other economic factors. Such factors, which are not readily quantifiable, would likely also affect our operations. Additional disclosure regarding various market risks is set forth in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 27, 2023, filed with the SEC on July 31, 2023.</p>
<h2>ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES</h2>
<h2>(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures</h2>
<p>Management of the Company, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) as of March 2, 2024.</p>
