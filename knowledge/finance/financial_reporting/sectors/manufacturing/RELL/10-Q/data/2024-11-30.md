<p>Refer to the Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements in Part 1, Item 1.</p>
<h2>RICHARDSON ELECTRONICS, LTD.</h2>
<h2>NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>
<h2>1. DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY</h2>
<p>Richardson Electronics, Ltd. (the "Company," "we," "our") is a leading global manufacturer of engineered solutions, power grid and microwave tubes and related consumables; power conversion and RF and microwave components; high-value replacement parts, tubes and service training for diagnostic imaging equipment; and customized display solutions.

These products are used to control, switch or amplify electrical power signals, or are used as display devices in a variety of industrial, commercial, medical and communication applications.</p>
<p>The Company reports its financial performance for the following business segments: Power and Microwave Technologies ("PMT"), Green Energy Solutions ("GES"), Canvys and Healthcare. A description of the Company's business segments is provided in Note 10, Segment and Geographic Information.</p>
<p>We currently operate within the following major geographic regions: North America, Asia/Pacific, Europe and Latin America.</p>
<h2>2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION</h2>
<p>The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.</p>
<p>Our fiscal quarter ends on the Saturday nearest the end of the quarter-ending month. The second quarter of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 both contained 13 weeks. The first six months of fiscal 2025 contained 26 weeks and the first six months of fiscal 2024 contained 27 weeks.</p>
<p>In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of interim periods have been made. All inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated. The unaudited consolidated financial statements presented herein include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to applicable rules and regulations. The results of our operations for the six months ended November 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2025.</p>
<p>As described in Note 1, Description of the Company the Company reports its financial performance based on four operating and reportable segments. The financial information contained in this report should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2024, which was filed with the SEC on August 5, 2024.</p>
<h2>3. RECLASSIFICATIONS</h2>
<p>Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period reporting classifications. The reclassification was related to the unrealized foreign exchange gain on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.</p>
<h2>4. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS - NOT YET ADOPTED</h2>
<p>In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which expands the disclosures required in an entity's income tax rate reconciliation table and requires disclosure of income taxes paid in both U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted, to be applied on a prospective basis, with retrospective application permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company's disclosures.</p>
<p>In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. The amendment requires disclosures of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") and included within each reported measure of segment profit of loss, an amount and description of its composition for other segment items, and interim disclosures of a reportable segment's profit or loss and assets. The new guidance also requires that a public entity that has a single reportable segment provide all the disclosures required by the amendments in this update and all existing segment disclosures. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. Upon adoption, this guidance should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented. The Company is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company's disclosures.</p>
<h2>5. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES</h2>
<p>Inventories, net: Our consolidated inventories were stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value, generally using a weighted-average cost method. Our net inventories include approximately $94.6 million of finished goods, $11.6 million of raw materials and $4.5 million of work-in-progress as of November 30, 2024, as compared to approximately $93.9 million of finished goods, $12.2 million of raw materials and $4.0 million of work-in-progress as of June 1, 2024.</p>
<p>Provisions for obsolete or slow-moving inventories are recorded based upon regular analysis of stock rotation privileges, obsolescence, the exiting of certain markets and assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Inventory reserves were approximately $6.1 million as of November 30, 2024 and $6.0 million as of June 1, 2024.</p>
<p>Revenue Recognition: Our customers are generally not resellers, but rather businesses that incorporate our products into their processes, from which they generate an economic benefit. The goods are also distinct in that each item sold to the customer is clearly identified on both the purchase order and resulting invoice. Each product we sell benefits the customer independently of the other products. Each item on each purchase order from the customer can be used by the customer unrelated to any other products we provide to the customer. Revenue is recognized when control transfers since it is not always based on delivery of the goods. The Company's revenue includes the following streams:</p>
<ul>
<li>·Manufacturing/assembly</li>
<li>·Distribution</li>
<li>·Services revenue</li>
</ul>
<p>Manufacturing/assembly typically includes the products that are manufactured or assembled in our manufacturing facility. These products can either be built to the customer's prints/designs or are products that we stock in our warehouse to sell to any customer that places an order. The manufacturing business does not include a separate service bundled with the product sold or sold in addition to the product. Our contracts for customized products generally include termination provisions if a customer cancels their order. However, we recognize revenue at a point in time because the termination provisions normally do not require, upon cancellation, the customer to pay fees that are commensurate with the work performed. Each purchase order explicitly states the goods or services that we promise to transfer to the customer. The promises to the customer are limited only to those goods or services. The performance obligation is our promise to deliver both goods that were produced by the Company and resale of goods that we purchase from our suppliers. Our shipping and handling activities for destination shipments are performed prior to the customer obtaining control. As such, they are not a separate promised service. The Company elects to account for shipping and handling as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the goods. The goods we provide to our customers are distinct in that our customers benefit from the goods we sell them through use in their own processes.</p>
<p>Distribution typically includes products purchased from our suppliers, stocked in our warehouses and then sold to our customers. The distribution business does not include a separate service bundled with the product sold or sold on top of the product. Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers, which is simultaneous with the title transferring to the customer, in an amount that reflects the transaction price consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods. Control refers to the ability of the customer to direct the use of and obtain substantially all the remaining benefits from the goods. Our transaction price consideration is fixed, unless otherwise disclosed below as variable consideration. Generally, our contracts require our customers to pay for goods after we deliver products to them. Terms are generally open account, payable net 30 days in North America, and vary throughout Asia/Pacific, Europe and Latin America subject to customary credit checks.</p>
<p>Repair, installation or training activities generate services revenue. The services we provide are relatively short in duration and are typically completed in one or two weeks. Therefore, at each reporting date, the amount of unbilled work is insignificant. The services revenue has consistently accounted for less than 5% of the Company's total revenues and is expected to continue at that level.</p>
<p>Contracts with customers: A revenue contract exists once a customer purchase order is received, reviewed and accepted. Each accepted purchase order identifies a distinct good or service as the Company's performance obligation. The goods include standard products purchased from a supplier and stocked on our shelves, customized products purchased from a supplier, products that are customized or have value added to them in house prior to shipping to the customer and manufactured products. Prior to accepting a customer purchase order, we review the credit worthiness of the customer. Purchase orders are deemed to meet the collectability criterion once the customer's credit is approved. The Company receives advance payments or deposits from our customers before revenue is recognized resulting in contract liabilities. Contract liabilities are included in accrued liabilities in the unaudited consolidated balance sheets.</p>
<p>We sell our products to customers in diversified industries and perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers' financial condition. Payment terms are generally on open account, payable net 30 days in North America, and vary throughout Asia/Pacific, Europe and Latin America. Estimates of credit losses are recorded in the financial statements based on monthly reviews of outstanding accounts.</p>

<p>During the three and six months ended November 30, 2024 the Company recognized $1.2 million and $2.1 million, respectively, of revenue upon satisfaction of performance obligations related to amounts that were included in the contract liabilities balance as of June 1, 2024. During the three and six months ended December 2, 2023, the Company recognized $1.4 million and $2.9 million, respectively, of revenue upon satisfaction of performance obligations related to amounts that were included in the contract liabilities balance as of May 27, 2023.</p>
<p>See Note 10, Segment &amp; Geographic Information for a disaggregation of revenue by reportable segment and geographic region, which represents how our chief operating decision maker reviews information internally to evaluate our financial performance and to make resource allocation and other decisions for the Company.</p>
<p>Loss Contingencies: We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. If we determine that there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred, we will include a disclosure describing the contingency.</p>
<p>=== SUBSET BREAK ===</p>
<p>Intangible Assets: Intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair market values determined by quoted market prices in active markets, if available, or by recognized valuation models. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives either on a straight-line basis or over their projected future cash flows and are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate possible impairment. Our intangible assets represent the fair value for customer relationships agreements acquired in connection with prior acquisitions. Technology represents the fair value acquired in connection with acquisitions and an exclusive license, manufacturing and distribution agreement. Intangible assets subject to amortization were as follows (in thousands) :</p>

<p>The weighted average number of years of amortization expense remaining is 10 years.</p>
<p>Income Taxes: We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and determine the need for a valuation allowance based on a number of factors, including both positive and negative evidence. These factors include historical taxable income or loss, projected future taxable income or loss, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies. In circumstances where we, or any of our affiliates, have incurred three years of cumulative losses which constitute significant negative evidence, positive evidence of equal or greater significance is needed to overcome the negative evidence before a tax benefit is recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards.</p>

<p>Warranties: We offer assurance type warranties for the limited number of specific products we manufacture. We estimate the cost to perform under the warranty obligation and recognize this estimated cost at the time of the related product sale. We record expense related to our warranty obligations as cost of sales in our consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income. Each quarter, we assess actual warranty costs incurred on a product-by-product basis and compare the warranty costs to our estimated warranty obligation. With respect to new products, estimates are based generally on knowledge of the products and warranty experience.</p>
<p>Warranty reserves are established for costs that are expected to be incurred after the sale and delivery of products under warranty. Warranty reserves are included in accrued liabilities on our unaudited consolidated balance sheets. The warranty reserves are determined based on known product failures, historical experience and other available evidence. Warranty reserves were approximately $0.7 million as of November 30, 2024 and June 1, 2024.</p>
<h2>6. REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY</h2>
<p>The Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") for a three-year Revolving Credit Facility with PNC Bank N.A. on March 20, 2023 (the "Revolving Credit Facility"). The Revolving Credit Facility will mature on March 20, 2026. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, including the swingline loan and letter of credit sub-facility extended to the Company thereunder, are secured by (i) a continuing first priority lien on and security interest in and to substantially all of the assets of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries and (ii) a continuing first priority pledge of the Pledged Collateral of the Company and the Guarantors identified in the Security Agreement and the Pledge Agreement executed in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility. The combined maximum borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are $30 million. Proceeds of borrowings may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Company utilized $1.0 million of the credit line to address short-term working capital needs and repaid that $1.0 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2025. There was no utilization of the credit line in the second quarter of fiscal 2025. As of November 30, 2024, no amount was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.</p>
<p>The Credit Agreement provides that the Company must maintain compliance with a maximum consolidated leverage ratio covenant and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio, each as determined in accordance with the Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement also contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this type, including, among other things, limitations on certain other indebtedness, loans and investments, liens, mergers, asset sales, and transactions with affiliates, as well as customary events of default for financings of this type. The Company was in compliance with financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as of November 30, 2024.</p>
<p>Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate per annum selected by the Company from the following options: (a) Term SOFR Rate (for the applicable Interest Period) plus the SOFR Adjustment (for the applicable Interest Period) plus 1.25%; (b) Base Rate plus 0.25% or (c) Daily Simple RFR (for Euros) plus the RFR Adjustment plus 1.25%. Letters of credit issued under the letter of credit sub-facility will have a letter of credit fee equal to 1.25% per annum. The fee for the unused portion of the credit line is 0.10%.</p>
<h2>7. LEASE OBLIGATIONS</h2>
<p>The Company leases real and personal property in the normal course of business under various operating leases. The Company uses operating leases for facility space and automobiles. Most of the leased facility space is for sales and general office use. Automobile leases are used throughout the Company.</p>
<p>Several leases include renewal clauses which vary in length and may not include specific rent renewal amounts. The Company will revise the value of the right of use assets and associated lease liabilities upon a remeasurement event.</p>

<h2>8. INCOME TAXES</h2>
<p>We recorded an income tax benefit of $0.2 million and $0.1 million for the first six months of fiscal 2025 and the first six months of fiscal 2024, respectively. The effective income tax rate during the first six months of fiscal 2025 was a tax benefit of 60.4% as compared to a tax benefit of 16.5% during the first six months of fiscal 2024. The difference in rate during the first six months of fiscal 2025 as compared to the first six months of fiscal 2024 reflects changes in the geographical distribution of income (loss), which is primarily driven by an increase in U.S. earnings for fiscal 2025 and the state income tax provision, as well as the impact of U.S. research and development credits. The 60.4% effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% as a result of the geographical distribution of income (loss), as well as the utilization of the U.S. research and development credit.</p>
<p>In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. Years prior to fiscal 2015 are closed for examination under the statute of limitation for U.S. federal, and U.S. state. In Netherlands, years prior to fiscal 2020 are closed for examination. We are under examination in Germany for fiscal years 2019 to 2022. We have no current open audits in the U.S.</p>
<p>We have historically determined that certain undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, to the extent of cash available, will be repatriated to the U.S. The deferred tax liability on the outside basis difference is now primarily withholding tax on future dividend distributions. The deferred tax liability related to undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries was less than $0.1 million as of November 30, 2024 and June 1, 2024.</p>
<p>The Company recorded $0.3 million for uncertain tax positions as of November 30, 2024 as compared to $0.1 million as of June 1, 2024. We record interest related to uncertain tax positions in the income tax expense line item within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income. Accrued interest was included within the related tax liability line in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have recorded a liability of less than $0.1 million for interest and penalties as it relates to the reserve of the research and development credit as of June 1, 2024 and November 30, 2024.</p>
<p>The Company maintains a valuation allowance representing the portion of the deferred tax asset that management does not believe is more likely than not to be realized. The valuation allowance was $2.2 million as of November 30, 2024 and June 1, 2024. The current valuation allowance is recorded on deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions where historical taxable losses have been incurred ($1.1 million) and state NOLs ($1.1 million). The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are increased, or if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth.</p>
<h2>9. EARNINGS PER SHARE</h2>
<p>We have authorized 17,000,000 shares of common stock and 3,000,000 shares of Class B common stock. The Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and has transferability restrictions; however, Class B common stock may be converted into common stock on a share-for-share basis at any time. With respect to dividends and distributions, shares of common stock and Class B common stock rank equally and have the same rights, except that Class B common stock cash dividends are limited to 90% of the amount of common stock cash dividends.</p>
<p>Our Class B common stock is considered a participating security requiring the use of the two-class method for the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share. The two-class computation method for each period reflects the cash dividends paid per share for each class of stock, plus the amount of allocated undistributed (loss) earnings per share computed using the participation percentage which reflects the dividend rights of each class of stock. Basic and diluted earnings per share were computed using the two-class method. The shares of Class B common stock are considered to be participating convertible securities since the shares of Class B common stock are convertible on a share-for-share basis into shares of common stock and may participate in dividends with common stock according to a predetermined formula which is 90% of the amount of common stock cash dividends.</p>
<p>The allocation of undistributed (loss) earnings between common stock and Class B common stock is based on the relationship of the weighted shares outstanding for the respective stock class (common or Class B) to the total of the weighted shares outstanding for common stock and 90% of the weighted shares outstanding for Class B common stock. The adjustment to the number of outstanding Class B common stock shares reflects the limitation of Class B common stock dividends to 90% of common stock dividends.</p>
<p>The earnings per share ("EPS") presented in our unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income was based on the following amounts ( in thousands, except per share amounts ):</p>

<h2>11. RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES</h2>
<p>Our business and the companies with which we do business are subject to risks and uncertainties caused by factors beyond our control. Such factors include economic pressures related to inflation, rising interest rates, economic weakness or recession, as well as geopolitical and public health, tightening labor markets, and pandemics. These and other similar conditions and events have in the past and could in the future disrupt our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.</p>
<h2>ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</h2>

The terms "may," "should," "could," "anticipate," "believe," "continue," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "objective," "plan," "potential," "project" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. These statements are based on management's current expectations, intentions or beliefs and are subject to a number of factors, assumptions and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences or that might otherwise impact the business include; economic, labor and political conditions; global business disruption caused by the Russian - Ukraine and Israel - Hamas wars; currency exchange fluctuations; and the ability of the Company to manage its growth and the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on August 5, 2024. We undertake no obligation to update any such factor or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.</p>
<p>In addition, while we do, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against our policy to disclose to them or any outside third party, any material non-public information or other confidential commercial information.

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&amp;A") is intended to assist the reader in better understanding our business, results of operations, financial condition, changes in financial condition and significant developments. MD&amp;A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this filing. This section is organized as follows:</p>
<h2>· Business Overview</h2>
<p>· Results of Operations - an analysis and comparison of our consolidated results of operations for the three month and six month periods ended November 30, 2024 and December 2, 2023, as reflected in our unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive (loss) income.</p>
<p>· Liquidity, Financial Position and Capital Resources - a discussion of our primary sources and uses of cash for the six month periods ended November 30, 2024 and December 2, 2023, and a discussion of changes in our financial position.</p>
<h2>Business Overview</h2>
<p>Richardson Electronics, Ltd. (the "Company," "we," "our") is a leading global manufacturer of engineered solutions, power grid and microwave tubes and related consumables; power conversion and RF and microwave components; high-value replacement parts, tubes and service training for diagnostic imaging equipment; and customized display solutions. Approximately 50% of our products are manufactured at our facilities located in LaFox, Illinois, Marlborough, Massachusetts and Donaueschingen, Germany, or by one of our manufacturing partners throughout the world. We serve customers in the alternative energy, healthcare, aviation, broadcast, communications, industrial, marine, medical, military, scientific and semiconductor markets. The Company's strategy is to provide specialized technical expertise and "engineered solutions" based on our core engineering and manufacturing capabilities. The Company provides solutions and adds value through design-in support, systems integration, prototype design and manufacturing, testing, logistics and aftermarket technical service and repair through its global infrastructure.</p>
<p>Some of the Company's products are manufactured in China and imported into the United States. The Office of the United States Trade Representative ("USTR") instituted tariffs on the importation of a number of products into the United States from China. These tariffs are a response to what the USTR considers to be certain unfair trade practices by China. A number of the Company's products manufactured in China are subject to duties when imported into the United States.</p>
<p>Management continues to work with its suppliers as well as its customers to mitigate the impact of the tariffs on our customers. However, if the Company is unable to successfully pass through the additional cost of these tariffs, or if the higher prices reduce demand for the Company's products, it will have a negative effect on the Company's sales and gross margins.</p>
<p>We currently operate within the following major geographic regions: North America, Asia/Pacific, Europe and Latin America.</p>
<p>The Company reports its financial performance based on the operating and reportable segments defined as follows:</p>
<p>Power and Microwave Technologies ("PMT") combines our core engineered solutions capabilities, power grid and microwave tube business with new disruptive RF, Wireless and Power technologies.

We offer long-term availability and proven custom display solutions that include touch screens, protective panels, custom enclosures, All-In-One computers, specialized cabinet finishes and application specific software packages and certification services. Our volume commitments are lower than the large display manufacturers, making us the ideal choice for companies with very specific design requirements. We partner with both private label manufacturing companies and leading branded hardware vendors to offer the highest quality display and touch solutions and customized computing platforms.</p>
<p>Healthcare manufactures, repairs, refurbishes and distributes high value replacement parts and equipment for the healthcare market including hospitals, medical centers, asset management companies, independent service organizations and multi-vendor service providers. Products include diagnostic imaging replacement parts for CT and MRI systems; replacement CT and MRI tubes; CT service training; MRI and RF amplifiers; hydrogen thyratrons, klystrons, magnetrons; flat panel detector upgrades; pre-owned CT systems; and additional replacement solutions currently under development for the diagnostic imaging service market.

Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 31.7% during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 from 33.5% during the second quarter of fiscal 2024 primarily due to increased freight costs.</p>
<p>Canvys net sales decreased 15.7% to $14.5 million during the first six months of fiscal 2025 from $17.2 million during the first six months of fiscal 2024, due to lower sales in both the North American and European markets. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to 33.1% during the first six months of fiscal 2025 from 33.8% during the first six months of fiscal 2024 primarily due to increased freight costs.</p>
<h2>Healthcare</h2>
<p>Healthcare net sales decreased 22.8% to $2.3 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 from $2.9 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2024 due to decreases in all Healthcare product lines. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 35.7% during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to 14.8% during the second quarter of fiscal 2024 primarily due to improved manufacturing absorption.</p>
<p>Healthcare net sales increased 10.5% to $6.1 million during the first six months of fiscal 2025 from $5.5 million during the first six months of fiscal 2024 primarily due to increases in parts and CT tube sales, partially offset by a decrease in equipment sales. Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased to 33.6% during the first six months of fiscal 2025 as compared to 22.7% during the first six months of fiscal 2024 primarily due to improved manufacturing absorption and product mix.</p>
<h2>Selling, General and Administrative Expenses</h2>
<p>Selling, general and administrative expenses ("SG&amp;A") increased to $16.0 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 when compared to $14.5 million for the year ago quarter. This increase of $1.5 million or 10.4% from the second quarter of fiscal 2024 mainly reflected higher incentives due to sales growth. Expressed as a percentage of net sales, SG&amp;A was 32.3% for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 compared to 32.8% in the second quarter of fiscal 2024.</p>
<p>SG&amp;A increased to $32.1 million for the first six months of fiscal 2025 when compared to $30.3 million for the first six months of fiscal 2024. This increase of $1.8 million or 6.0% from the first six months of fiscal 2024 mainly reflected higher incentives due to sales growth. Expressed as a percentage of net sales, SG&amp;A was 31.1% for the first six months of fiscal 2025 compared to 31.3% for the first six months of fiscal 2024.</p>
<h2>Other Income/Expense</h2>
<p>Other income and expense includes interest income, foreign exchange gains and foreign exchange losses. Our foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily due to the translation of U.S. dollars held in non-U.S. entities. We currently do not utilize derivative instruments to manage our exposure to foreign currency.</p>
<p>Other expense during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 totaled $0.4 million compared to a $0.3 million expense for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. This increase is due to a $0.1 million increase in foreign exchange losses.</p>
<p>Other expense during the first six months of fiscal 2025 totaled $0.1 million, unchanged when compared to the first six months of fiscal 2024.</p>
<h2>Income Tax Provision</h2>
<p>We recorded an income tax benefit of $0.3 million and $0.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 and the second quarter of fiscal 2024, respectively. The effective income tax rate during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was 28.8% as compared to 21.6% during the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The difference in rate during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024 reflects changes in the geographical distribution of income (loss), which is primarily driven by an increase in U.S. earnings for fiscal 2025 and the state income tax provision, as well as the impact of U.S. research and development credits. The 28.8% effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% as a result of the geographical distribution of income (loss) and the utilization of the U.S. research and development credit.</p>
<p>We recorded an income tax benefit of $0.2 million and $0.1 million for the first six months of fiscal 2025 and the first six months of fiscal 2024, respectively. The effective income tax rate during the first six months of fiscal 2025 was a tax benefit of 60.4% as compared to a tax benefit of 16.5% during the first six months of fiscal 2024. The difference in rate during the first six months of fiscal 2025 as compared to the first six months of fiscal 2024 reflects changes in the geographical distribution of income (loss), which is primarily driven by an increase in U.S. earnings for fiscal 2025 and the state income tax provision, as well as the impact of U.S. research and development credits. The 60.4% effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate of 21% as a result of the geographical distribution of income (loss), as well as the utilization of the U.S. research and development credit.</p>
<p>In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. Years prior to fiscal 2015 are closed for examination under the statute of limitation for U.S. federal, and U.S. state. In Netherlands, years prior to fiscal 2020 are closed for examination. We are under examination in Germany for fiscal years 2019 to 2022. We have no current open audits in the U.S.</p>
<p>The Company recorded $0.3 million for uncertain tax positions as of November 30, 2024 as compared to $0.1 million as of June 1, 2024. We record interest related to uncertain tax positions in the income tax expense line item within the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive (Loss) Income. Accrued interest was included within the related tax liability line in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We have recorded a liability of less than $0.1 million for interest and penalties as it relates to the reserve of the research and development credit as of June 1, 2024 and November 30, 2024.</p>
<h2>Net Income and Per Share Data</h2>
<p>Net loss during the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was $0.8 million, or $0.05 per diluted common share and $0.05 per Class B diluted common share as compared to a net loss of $1.8 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2024 or $0.13 per diluted common share and $0.12 per Class B diluted common share.</p>
<p>Net loss during the first six months of fiscal 2025 was $0.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted common share and $0.01 per Class B diluted common share as compared to a net loss of $0.6 million during the first six months of fiscal 2024 or $0.04 per diluted common share and $0.04 per Class B diluted common share.</p>
<h2>LIQUIDITY, FINANCIAL POSITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES</h2>
<p>Our operations and cash needs have been primarily financed through operations and cash on hand.</p>
<p>Cash and cash equivalents were $26.6 million at November 30, 2024. Cash and cash equivalents by geographic area at November 30, 2024 consisted of $8.5 million in North America, $8.9 million in Europe, $1.2 million in Latin America and $8.0 million in Asia/Pacific. No cash was repatriated to the United States in the first six months of fiscal 2025. Although the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act generally eliminated federal income tax on future cash repatriation to the United States, cash repatriation may be subject to state and local taxes, withholding or similar taxes. See Note 8, Income Taxes , of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2024, filed with the SEC on August 5, 2024, for further information.</p>
<p>Cash and cash equivalents were $24.3 million at June 1, 2024. Cash and cash equivalents by geographic area at June 1, 2024 consisted of $7.1 million in North America, $7.3 million in Europe, $1.1 million in Latin America and $8.8 million in Asia/Pacific. We repatriated $0.3 million to the United States in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 from our entity in Mexico.</p>
<p>Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from: (i) working capital requirements, (ii) capital expenditure needs and (iii) cash dividend payments (if and when declared by our Board of Directors). Our ability to fund these requirements will depend, in part, on our future cash flows, which are determined by our future operating performance and, therefore, subject to prevailing global macroeconomic conditions and financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.</p>
<p>Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that the existing sources of liquidity, including current cash, will provide sufficient resources to meet known capital requirements and working capital needs through the next twelve months. Additionally, while our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the economy and the outlook for growth in our markets, we believe our existing sources of liquidity as well as our ability to generate operating cash flows will satisfy our future obligations and cash requirements.</p>
<p>On March 20, 2023, the Company established a senior, secured revolving credit facility agreement with a three-year term in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $30 million, including a swingline loan and a letter of credit sub-facility (collectively, the "Revolving Credit Facility") with PNC Bank. The Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by the Company's domestic subsidiaries. Proceeds of the borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are expected to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company utilized $1.0 million of the credit line to address short-term cash requirements and repaid that $1.0 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2025. There was no utilization of the credit line during the second quarter of fiscal 2025. As of the end of the second quarter for fiscal 2025 and the date of this report, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.</p>
<h2>Cash Flows from Operating Activities</h2>
<p>Cash flows from operating activities are primarily a result of our net income (loss) adjusted for non-cash items and changes in our operating assets and liabilities.</p>
<p>Operating activities generated $5.9 million of cash during the first six months of fiscal 2025. We had a net loss of $0.2 million during the first six months of fiscal 2025, which included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $0.9 million associated with the issuance of stock option and restricted stock awards, inventory reserve provisions of $0.2 million, unrealized foreign exchange gain of $0.2 million and depreciation and amortization expense of $2.1 million associated with our property, plant and equipment and intangible assets. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities generated $3.2 million in cash during the first six months of fiscal 2025, net of foreign currency exchange gains and losses, included an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $5.2 million, an increase accounts receivable of $1.1 million and an increase in inventories of $1.7 million. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the higher level of sales. The changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities were timing related.</p>
<p>Operating activities generated $1.8 million of cash during the first six months of fiscal 2024. We had a net loss of $0.6 million during the first six months of fiscal 2024, which included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $0.8 million associated with the issuance of stock option and restricted stock awards, inventory reserve provisions of $0.3 million and depreciation and amortization expense of $2.1 million associated with our property and equipment as well as amortization of our intangible assets. Changes in our operating assets and liabilities used $0.9 million in cash during the first six months of fiscal 2024, net of foreign currency exchange gains and losses included an increase in inventory of $6.2 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $1.1 million and an increase in prepayments of $0.2 million. Partially offsetting the cash utilization was a decrease in receivables of $6.3 million and an increase in accrued liabilities of $0.4 million. The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to the lower level of sales across our operating segments in the current quarter. Most of the inventory increase supported the products for electron tubes and GES. The changes in accounts payable and accrued liabilities were timing related.</p>
<h2>Cash Flows from Investing Activities</h2>
<p>Cash used in investing activities of $1.4 million during the first six months of fiscal 2025 was due to capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were primarily related to our IT system and LaFox manufacturing and facilities. LaFox manufacturing primarily supports the Electron Device Group ("EDG") and Green Energy Solutions ("GES").</p>
<p>Cash used in investing activities of $2.7 million during the first six months of fiscal 2024 was due to capital expenditures. Capital expenditures were primarily related to our IT system and the LaFox manufacturing and facilities renovation. LaFox manufacturing primarily supports the Electron Device Group ("EDG") and Green Energy Solutions ("GES").</p>
<h2>Cash Flows from Financing Activities</h2>
<p>Cash flows used in financing activities consist primarily of cash dividends and cash flows provided by financing activities consist primarily of the proceeds from the issuance of stock. All future dividend payments are at the discretion of the Board of Directors. Dividend payments depend on earnings, capital requirements, operating conditions and such other factors that the Board may deem relevant.</p>
<p>Cash used in financing activities of $1.6 million during the first six months of fiscal 2025 primarily resulted from $1.7 million of dividend payments to stockholders partially offset by $0.3 million of proceeds from the issuance of stock.</p>
<p>Cash used by financing activities of $1.5 million during the first six months of fiscal 2024 primarily resulted from $1.7 million of dividend payments to stockholders partially offset by $0.3 million of proceeds from the issuance of stock.</p>
<h2>Critical Accounting Estimates</h2>
<p>There have been no material changes in our critical accounting estimates from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 1, 2024, filed with the SEC on August 5, 2024. We are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that would require us to update our estimates, assumptions and judgments.</p>
<h2>Impact of New Accounting Standards</h2>

<p>For information about recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 4, New Accounting Pronouncements - Not Yet Adopted , included in Part 1, Item</p>
<h2>ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK</h2>
<h2>Risk Management and Market Sensitive Financial Instruments</h2>
<p>We are exposed to many different market risks with the various industries we serve. The primary financial risk we are exposed to is foreign currency exchange, as certain of our operations, assets and liabilities are denominated in foreign currencies. We manage these risks through normal operating and financing activities.</p>
<p>The interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in exchange rates would likely influence other economic factors. Such factors, which are not readily quantifiable, would likely also affect our operations. Additional disclosure regarding various market risks is set forth in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 1, 2024 filed with the SEC on August 5, 2024.</p>
