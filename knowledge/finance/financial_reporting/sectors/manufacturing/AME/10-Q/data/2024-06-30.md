(the "Company") believes that all adjustments (which primarily consist of normal recurring accruals) necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial position of the Company at June 30, 2024, the consolidated results of its operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 and its cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 have been included. Quarterly results of operations are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.

## Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ("ASU 2023-07"), which requires disclosure of significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis under ASC 280. ASU 2023-07 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted and the amendments in this ASU should be applied on a retrospective basis to all periods presented. The Company has not determined the impact ASU 2023-07 may have on the Company's financial statement disclosures.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures ("ASU 2023-09"), which improves income tax disclosures by requiring (1) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (2) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. It also includes certain other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The ASU indicates that all entities will apply its guidance prospectively with an option for retroactive application to each period in the financial statements. The Company has not determined the impact ASU 2023-09 may have on the Company's financial statement disclosures.

## Product Warranties

The Company provides limited warranties in connection with the sale of its products. The warranty periods for products sold vary among the Company's operations, but the majority do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its warranty expense provision based on its historical warranty experience and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses. Product warranty obligations are reported as a component of Accrued liabilities and other in the consolidated balance sheet.

| Balance at the beginning of the period | $ 37,087 | $ 26,487 |

| Warranty accruals related to acquired businesses and other during the period | (30) | 244 |
| Balance at the end of the period | $ 36,632 | $ 28,839 |

## Accounts Receivable

The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to meet their financial obligations to the Company. The Company recognizes an allowance for credit losses, on all accounts receivable and contract assets, which considers risk of future credit losses based on factors such as historical experience, contract terms, as well as general and market business conditions, country, and political risk. Balances are written off when determined to be uncollectible.

At June 30, 2024, the Company had $976.4 million of accounts receivable, net of allowances of $14.3 million. Changes in the allowance were not material for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024.

4. Earnings Per Share

______________________________________________________________________

The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares considered outstanding during the periods. The calculation of diluted earnings per share reflects the effect of all potentially dilutive securities (principally outstanding stock options and restricted stock grants). The number of weighted average shares used in the calculation of basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share was as follows:

| | Three Months Ended June 30, | Three Months Ended June 30, | Six Months Ended June 30, | Six Months Ended June 30, |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | 2024 | 2023 | 2024 | 2023 |
| | (In thousands) | (In thousands) | (In thousands) | (In thousands) |
| Weighted average shares: | | | | |
| Basic shares | 231,437 | 230,478 | 231,267 | 230,302 |
| Equity-based compensation plans | 867 | 783 | 903 | 943 |
| Diluted shares | 232,304 | 231,261 | 232,170 | 231,245 |

The calculation of diluted earnings per share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 excluded an immaterial number of stock options because the exercise prices of these stock options exceeded the average market price of the Company's common shares, and the effect of their inclusion would have been antidilutive. There were no antidilutive shares for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023.

5. Fair Value Measurements

______________________________________________________________________

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.

The Company utilizes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to the valuations used to measure fair value. This hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based on the Company's own assumptions used

## AMETEK, Inc.

## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

June 30, 2024

(Unaudited)

to measure assets and liabilities at fair value. A financial asset or liability's classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

The following table provides the Company's assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, consistent with the fair value hierarchy, at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

Table of Contents

| | June 30, 2024 | June 30, 2024 | June 30, 2024 | June 30, 2024 |

| | Total | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 |
| | (In thousands) | (In thousands) | (In thousands) | (In thousands) |
| Mutual fund investments | $ 12,018 | $ 12,018 | $ - | $ - |
| Foreign currency forward contracts | (276) | - | (276) | - |
| | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 |
| | Total | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 |
| | (In thousands) | (In thousands) | (In thousands) | (In thousands) |
| Mutual fund investments | $ 11,922 | $ 11,922 | $ - | $ - |
| Foreign currency forward contracts | 2,035 | - | 2,035 | - |

The fair value of mutual fund investments is based on quoted market prices. The mutual fund investments are shown as a component of investments and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet.

For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, gains and losses on the investments noted above were not significant.No transfers between level 1 and level 2 investments occurred during the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.

## Foreign Currency

At June 30, 2024, the Company had a Euro forward contract for a total notional value of60.0 million Euros. The foreign currency forward contract is valued as a level 2 liability as it is corroborated by foreign currency exchange rates and shown as a component of other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, realized and unrealized gains and losses on the foreign currency forward contracts were not significant.

## Financial Instruments

Cash, cash equivalents and mutual fund investments are recorded at fair value at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.

The following table provides the estimated fair values of the Company's financial instrument liabilities, for which fair value is measured for disclosure purposes only, compared to the recorded amounts at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023:

| | June 30, 2024 | June 30, 2024 | December 31, 2023 | December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Recorded Amount | Fair Value | Recorded Amount | Fair Value |
| | (In thousands) | (In thousands) | (In thousands) | (In thousands) |
| Long-term debt (including current portion) | $ (2,175,213) | $ (2,068,035) | (2,197,538) | $ (2,087,607) |

The fair value of net short-term borrowings approximates the carrying value. The Company's net long-term debt is all privately held with no public market for this debt, therefore, the fair value of net long-term debt was computed based on comparable current market data for similar debt instruments and is considered a level 3 liability.

6. Hedging Activities

______________________________________________________________________

The Company has designated certain foreign-currency-denominated long-term borrowings as hedges of the net investment in certain foreign operations. As of June 30, 2024, these net investment hedges included British-pound-and Euro-denominated long-term debt. These borrowings were designed to create net investment hedges in certain designated foreign subsidiaries. The Company designated the British-pound- and Euro-denominated loans as hedging instruments to offset translation gains or losses on the net investment due to changes in the British pound and Euro exchange rates. These net

## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

June 30, 2024

(Unaudited)

investment hedges are evidenced by management's contemporaneous documentation supporting the hedge designation. Any gain or loss on the hedging instruments (the debt) following hedge designation is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in the same manner as the translation adjustment on the hedged investment based on changes in the spot rate, which is used to measure hedge effectiveness.

At June 30, 2024, the Company had $284.3 million of British-pound-denominated loans, which were designated as a hedge against the net investment in British pound functional currency foreign subsidiaries. At June 30, 2024, the Company had $545.4 million in Euro-denominated loans, which were designated as a hedge against the net investment in Euro functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the British-pound- and Euro-denominated loans designated and 100% effective as net investment hedges, $20.0 million of pre-tax currency remeasurement gains have been included in the foreign currency translation component of other comprehensive income for the six months ended June 30, 2024.

8. Leases

______________________________________________________________________

The Company has commitments under operating leases for certain facilities, vehicles and equipment used in its operations. Cash used in operations for operating leases was not materially different from operating lease expense for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. The Company's leases have a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately 7 years. Certain lease agreements contain provisions for future rent increases.

The components of lease expense were as follows:

| | Three Months Ended June 30, | Three Months Ended June 30, | Six Months Ended June 30, | Six Months Ended June 30, |

9. Acquisitions

______________________________________________________________________

The initial accounting for the December 2023 Paragon Medical acquisition is being finalized, including the measurement of the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities, as well as, the associated income tax considerations. Amounts for fixed assets, intangibles, and income taxes could change, potentially materially, as there is significant additional information that the Company must obtain to finalize the valuations of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and to finalize the value of the intangible assets.

The Company finalized its measurements of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities for its August 2023 acquisition of United Electronic Industries, which had no material impact to the consolidated statement of income and balance sheet. The Company is in the process of finalizing the accounting for income taxes for its October 2023 acquisition of Amplifier Research Corp.

10. Goodwill

11. Income Taxes

______________________________________________________________________

At June 30, 2024, the Company had gross uncertain tax benefits of $260.9 million, of which $211.2 million, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate.

The following is a reconciliation of the liability for uncertain tax positions (in millions):

| Balance at December 31, 2023 | $ 233.5 |
| --- | --- |
| Additions for tax positions | 28.8 |
| Reductions for tax positions | (1.4) |
| Balance at June 30, 2024 | $ 260.9 |

## AMETEK, Inc.

## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

June 30, 2024

(Unaudited)

The additions above primarily reflect the tax positions for foreign tax planning initiatives. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. The amounts recognized in income tax expense for interest and penalties during the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023 were not significant.

The effective tax rate for the three months ended June 30, 2024 was19.0%, compared with 18.2% for the three months ended June 30, 2023. The higher effective tax rate in the second quarter of 2024 is primarily due to higher U.S. taxes on foreign sourced earnings compared to the second quarter of 2023.

12. Share-Based Compensation

______________________________________________________________________

The Company's share-based compensation plans are described in Note 11, Share-Based Compensation, to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8, filed on the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Pre-tax share-based compensation expense is included in the consolidated statement of income in either Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on where the recipient's cash compensation is reported.

## Stock Options

The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the grant date using a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model.The following weighted average assumptions were used in the Black-Scholes-Merton model to estimate the fair values of stock options granted during the periods indicated:

| | Six Months Ended June 30, 2024 | Year Ended December 31, 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Expected volatility | 28.2 % | 26.0 % |
| Expected term (years) | 5.0 | 5.0 |
| Risk-free interest rate | 4.31 % | 3.54 % |

| Exercisable at June 30, 2024 | 1,860 | $ 97.05 | 6.0 | $ 129.6 |

The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $39.6 million. The total fair value of stock options vested during the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $14.7 million. As of June 30, 2024, there was approximately $22.9 million of expected future pretax compensation expense related to the 0.7 million non-vested stock options outstanding, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately two years.

## Restricted Stock

The following is a summary of the Company's non-vested restricted stock activity and related information:

| | Shares (In thousands) | Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value |
| --- | --- | --- |

| Granted | 148 | 181.60 |
| Vested | (137) | 132.72 |
| Forfeited | (12) | 151.02 |
| Non-vested restricted stock outstanding at June 30, 2024 | 295 | $ 159.09 |

The total fair value of restricted stock vested during the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $ 18.1 million. As of June 30, 2024, there was approximately $38.1 million of expected future pre-tax compensation expense related to the 0.3 million non-vested restricted shares outstanding, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately two years.

## Performance Restricted Stock Units

In March 2024, the Company granted performance restricted stock units ("PRSU") to officers and certain key management-level employees. The PRSUs vest over a period up to three years from the grant date based on continuous service, with the number of shares earned (0% to 200% of the target award) depending upon the extent to which the Company achieves certain financial and market performance targets measured over the period from January 1 of the year of grant to December 31 of the third year. Half of the PRSUs were valued in a manner similar to restricted stock as the financial targets are based on the Company's operating results, which represents a performance condition. The grant date fair value of these PRSUs are recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period based on the probable number of awards to vest at each reporting date.

The other half of the PRSUs were valued using a Monte Carlo model as the performance target is related to the Company's total shareholder return compared to a group of peer companies, which represents a market condition. The Company recognizes the grant date fair value of these awards as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period.

14. Contingencies

______________________________________________________________________

## Asbestos Litigation

The Company (including its subsidiaries) has been named as a defendant in a number of asbestos-related lawsuits. Certain of these lawsuits relate to a business which was acquired by the Company and do not involve products which were manufactured or sold by the Company. In connection with these lawsuits, the seller of such business has agreed to indemnify the Company against these claims (the "Indemnified Claims"). The Indemnified Claims have been tendered to, and are being defended by, such seller. The seller has met its obligations, in all respects, and the Company does not have any reason to believe such party would fail to fulfill its obligations in the future. To date, no judgments have been rendered against the Company as a result of any asbestos-related lawsuit. The Company believes that it has good and valid defenses to each of these claims and intends to defend them vigorously.

## Environmental Matters

Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as defined by federal and state laws and regulations. At June 30, 2024, the Company is named a Potentially Responsible Party ("PRP") at 12 non-AMETEK-owned former waste disposal or treatment sites (the "non-owned" sites). The Company is identified as a "de minimis" party in a majority of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to the amounts attributed to other named PRPs. The Company is participating in the investigation and/or related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves have been established to satisfy the Company's expected obligations. The Company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue. In addition to these non-owned sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations (the "owned" sites). For claims and proceedings against the Company with respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established once the Company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable. This estimate is refined as the Company moves through the various stages of investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain instances, the Company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the best estimate. It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements; however, the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements. In estimating the Company's liability for remediation, the Company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other PRPs to fulfill their obligations.

Total environmental reserves at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $30.6 million and $37.1 million, respectively, for both non-owned and owned sites. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, the Company recorded $4.5 million in reserves. Additionally, the Company spent $11.0 million on environmental matters for the six months ended June 30, 2024.

The Company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of previously owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements, the former or new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances. The Company and some of these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters.

The Company believes it has established reserves for the environmental matters described above, which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders. In the opinion of management, based on presently available information and the Company's historical experience related to such matters, an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.

For the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company posted record operating income. Contributions from the acquisitions of United Electronic Industries ("UEI") in August 2023, Amplifier Research Corp. ("Amplifier Research") in October 2023, and Paragon Medical ("Paragon") in December 2023, as well as our Operational Excellence initiatives, had a positive impact on the second quarter of 2024 results. In the first quarter of 2024, the Company recorded pre-tax integration costs related to the Paragon acquisition totaling $29.2 million, of which $22.4 million was employee severance. The integration costs reduced net income by $22.2 million. For the first six months of 2024, EMG experienced customer inventory normalization in our automation and engineered solutions core businesses, which we expect will continue through the remainder of 2024. The full year impact of the 2023 acquisitions, including the continued integration of Paragon, and focus on and implementation of our Operational Excellence initiatives are expected to have a positive impact on our 2024 results.
