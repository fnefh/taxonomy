Electromechanical is a differentiated supplier of precision motion control solutions, thermal management systems, specialty metals and electrical interconnects. Its end markets include aerospace and defense, medical, automation and other industrial markets.

## Competitive Strengths

Management believes AMETEK has significant competitive advantages that help strengthen and sustain its market positions. Those advantages include:

Significant Market Share . AMETEK maintains significant market share in a number of targeted niche markets through its ability to produce and deliver high-quality, differentiated products at competitive prices. EIG has significant market positions in niche segments of the process, power and industrial, and aerospace markets. EMG holds significant positions in niche segments of the aerospace and defense, automation and medical markets.

Technological and Development Capabilities . AMETEK believes it has certain technological advantages over its competitors that allow it to maintain its leading market positions. Historically, the Company has demonstrated an ability to develop innovative new products and solutions that support customer needs. AMETEK has consistently added to its investment in research, development and engineering, and improved its new product development efforts with the adoption of Design for Six Sigma and Value Analysis/Value Engineering methodologies. These have improved the pace and quality of product innovation and resulted in the introduction of a steady stream of new products across all of AMETEK's businesses and aligned with attractive secular growth markets.

Efficient and Flexible Manufacturing Operations. Through its Operational Excellence initiatives, AMETEK has established a lean and flexible manufacturing platform for its businesses. In its effort to achieve best-cost manufacturing, AMETEK had operating facilities, as of December 31, 2023, in China, Czechia, Malaysia, Mexico, and Serbia. These facilities offer proximity to customers and provide opportunities for increasing international sales. Acquisitions also have allowed AMETEK to achieve operating synergies by consolidating operations, product lines and distribution channels, benefiting both of AMETEK's operating groups.

Experienced Management Team . Another component of AMETEK's success is the strength of its management team and that team's commitment to improving Company performance.

shareholder value, and creating a sustainable future for all stakeholders. Individual performance is tied to financial results through Company-established stock ownership guidelines and equity incentive programs.

## Business Strategy

AMETEK is committed to achieving earnings growth through the successful implementation of the AMETEK Growth Model. The goal of that model is doubledigit annual percentage growth in sales and earnings per share over the business cycle, strong cash flow generation, and a superior return on total capital. Other financial initiatives have been or may be undertaken, including public and private debt or equity issuance, bank debt refinancing, local financing in certain foreign countries and share repurchases.

AMETEK's Growth Model integrates the four growth strategies of Operational Excellence, Strategic Acquisitions, Global and Market Expansion, and New Product Development with a focus on cash generation and capital deployment.

Operational Excellence. Operational Excellence is AMETEK's cornerstone strategy for accelerating growth, improving profit margins and strengthening its competitive position across its businesses. Operational Excellence focuses on initiatives to drive increased organic sales growth, improvements in operating efficiencies and sustainable practices. It emphasizes team building and a participative management culture. AMETEK's Operational Excellence strategies include lean manufacturing, global sourcing, Design for Six Sigma, Value Engineering/Value Analysis, growth kaizens, and digitalization. Each plays an important role in improving efficiency, enhancing the pace and quality of innovation and driving profitable sales growth. Operational Excellence initiatives have yielded lower operating and administrative costs, shortened manufacturing cycle times, resulted in higher cash flow from operations and increased customer satisfaction. They also have played a key role in achieving synergies from newly acquired companies.

Strategic Acquisitions . Acquisitions are a key to achieving the goals of the AMETEK Growth Model. Since the beginning of 2019 through December 31, 2023, AMETEK has completed 15 acquisitions with annualized sales totaling approximately $1.6 billion. AMETEK targets companies that offer a compelling strategic, technical and cultural fit. It seeks to acquire businesses in adjacent markets with complementary products and technologies. It also looks for businesses that provide attractive growth opportunities aligned with strong secular growth themes, often in new and emerging markets. Through these and prior acquisitions, AMETEK's management team has developed considerable skill in identifying, acquiring and integrating new businesses. As it has executed its acquisition strategy, AMETEK's mix of businesses has shifted toward those that are more highly differentiated and, therefore, offer better opportunities for growth and profitability.

Global & Market Expansion . AMETEK has historically experienced growth outside the United States, reflecting an expanding international customer base, investments in its global infrastructure and the attractive growth potential of its businesses in overseas markets. While Europe remains its largest overseas market, AMETEK has pursued growth opportunities worldwide, especially in key emerging markets. It has grown sales in Latin America and Asia by strategically building, acquiring and expanding manufacturing facilities. AMETEK also has expanded its sales, service, and engineering capabilities globally. Recently acquired businesses have further added to AMETEK's international presence.

New Product Development . New products are essential to AMETEK's long-term growth. As a result, AMETEK has maintained a consistent investment in new product development and engineering. AMETEK's businesses help solve our customers' most complex challenges with differentiated technology solutions. In 2023, AMETEK added to its highly differentiated product portfolio with a range of new products across many of its businesses.

AMETEK focuses on cash generation and capital deployment. AMETEK generates strong cash flow given its asset-light business model and strong operational execution. This cash flow supports AMETEK's capital deployment strategy with its primary focus on strategic, value-enhancing acquisitions. AMETEK is also committed to paying a consistently increasing cash dividend.

## Item 1A. Risk Factors

You should consider carefully the following risk factors and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents we incorporate by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

## Risks Related to Our Operations

Our growth could suffer if the markets into which we sell our products and services decline, do not grow as anticipated, experience cyclicality, or a general downturn in the economy could adversely affect our business.

A number of the industries in which we operate are cyclical in nature and therefore are affected by factors beyond our control. A downturn in the U.S. or global economy, and, in particular, in the aerospace and defense, oil and gas, process instrumentation or power markets could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our growth depends in part on the growth of the markets which we serve. Visibility into the future performance of certain of our markets is limited (particularly for markets into which we sell through distribution). Our quarterly sales and profits depend substantially on the volume and timing of orders received during the fiscal quarter, which are difficult to forecast. Any decline or lower than expected growth in our served markets could diminish demand for our products and services, which would adversely affect our financial statements. A number of our businesses operate in industries that may experience periodic, cyclical downturns. In addition, in certain of our businesses, demand depends on customers' capital spending budgets, as well as government funding policies. Matters of public policy and government budget dynamics, as well as product and economic cycles, can affect the spending decisions of these customers. Demand for our products and services is also sensitive to changes in

## Table of Contents

customer order patterns, which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in incentive programs, new product introductions and customer inventory levels. Any of these factors could adversely affect our growth and results of operations in any given period.

## We may not properly execute, or realize anticipated cost savings or benefits from, our Operational Excellence initiatives.

Our success is partly dependent upon properly executing and realizing cost savings or other benefits from our ongoing production and procurement initiatives. These initiatives are primarily designed to make the Company more efficient, which is necessary in the Company's highly competitive industries. These initiatives are often complex, and a failure to implement them properly may, in addition to not meeting projected cost savings or benefits, adversely affect our business and operations.

## Foreign and domestic economic, political, legal, compliance and business factors could negatively affect our international sales and operations.

International sales for 2023 and 2022 represented 47.4% and 48.7% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. As a result of our growth strategy, we anticipate that the percentage of sales outside the United States will increase in the future. As of December 31, 2023, we have manufacturing operations in 20 countries outside the United States, with significant operations in Canada, China, France, Germany, Mexico, Serbia, Poland and the United Kingdom. A disruption of our ability to obtain a supply of goods from these countries or a change in the cost to purchase, manufacture, or distribute these products could have an adverse effect on our sales and operations. International sales and operations are subject to the customary risks of operating in an international environment, including:

- · Imposition of trade or foreign exchange restrictions, including in the United States;
- · Overlap of different tax structures, including the development of a global minimum tax;
- · Unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, including in the United States;
- · Trade protection measures, such as the imposition of or increase in tariffs and other trade barriers, including in the United States;
- · The difficulty and/or costs of designing and implementing an effective control environment across diverse regions and employee bases;
- · Restrictions on currency repatriation;
- · General economic conditions;
- · Unstable political situations and social unrest, both internationally and in the United States;
- · Increasing trade tensions between the United States and certain countries, including China;
- · Nationalization of assets; and
- · Compliance with a wide variety of international and U.S. laws and regulatory requirements.

Furthermore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including changes in the relative value of currencies in the countries where we operate, subject us to exchange rate exposure and may adversely affect our financial statements. For example, increased strength in the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our

## Table of Contents

products sold overseas, which may adversely affect sales or require us to lower our prices. In addition, our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, and we must translate our assets, liabilities, sales and expenses into U.S. dollars for external reporting purposes. As a result, changes in the value of the U.S. dollar due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates or currency exchange controls may materially and negatively affect the value of these items in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their local currency.

## Our international sales and operations may be adversely impacted by compliance with export laws.

We are required to comply with various import, export, export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies and in other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item. In addition, failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and nonmonetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation.

## Our reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.

We cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, we rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct and violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our financial statements.

## Any inability to hire, train and retain a sufficient number of skilled officers and other employees could impede our ability to compete successfully.

If we cannot hire, train and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees, we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and realize anticipated results from those businesses, manage our expanding international operations and otherwise profitably grow our business. Even if we do hire and retain a sufficient number of employees, the expense necessary to attract and motivate these officers and employees may adversely affect our results of operations.

## If we are unable to develop new products on a timely basis, it could adversely affect our business and prospects.

We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to develop, on a timely basis, technologically advanced products that meet or exceed appropriate industry standards. Maintaining our existing technological advantages will require us to continue investing in research and development and sales and marketing. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments, that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses. We are not currently aware of any emerging standards or new products which could render our existing products obsolete, although there can be no assurance that this will not occur or that we will be able to develop and successfully market new products.

## Table of Contents

## Our technology is important to our success and our failure to protect this technology could put us at a competitive disadvantage.

Many of our products rely on proprietary technology; therefore, we endeavor to protect our intellectual property rights through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, confidentiality agreements and other contractual provisions. Despite our efforts to protect proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. In addition, our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights may be limited in certain countries outside the U.S. Actions to enforce our rights may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and we make no assurances that any such actions will be successful.

## A disruption in, shortage of, or price increases for, supply of our components and raw materials may adversely impact our operations.

While we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products, we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components, including semiconductor chips and other electronic components, from suppliers. The availability and prices for raw materials, parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers' allocation to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. In addition, our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems, and products may be impacted by natural or man-made disruptions, including armed conflict, damaging weather or other acts of nature, pandemics or other public health crises. A shutdown of, or inability to utilize, one or more of our facilities, our supply chain, or our distribution system could significantly disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, damage our relationships and reputation with customers, suppliers, employees, stockholders and others, result in lost sales, result in the misappropriation or corruption of data, or result in legal exposure and large remediation or other expenses. Furthermore, certain items, including base metals and certain steel components, are available only from a limited number of suppliers and are subject to commodity market fluctuations. Shortages in raw materials or price increases therefore could affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our competitive position, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

## We are subject to numerous governmental regulations, which may be burdensome or lead to significant costs.

Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign governmental laws and regulations. In addition, existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted and new laws and regulations, including with respect to privacy legislation and climate change, may be adopted or become applicable to us or customers for our products. These laws continue to develop and may be inconsistent from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Complying with emerging and changing international requirements may cause the Company to incur substantial costs or require the Company to change its business practices. We cannot predict the form any such new laws or regulations will take or the impact any of these laws and regulations will have on our business or operations.

## Table of Contents

## We operate in highly competitive industries, which may adversely affect our results of operations or ability to expand our business.

Our markets are highly competitive. We compete, domestically and internationally, with individual producers, as well as with vertically integrated manufacturers, some of which have resources greater than we do. The principal elements of competition for our products are product technology, quality, service, distribution and price. Although we believe EIG is a market leader, competition is strong and could intensify in the markets served by EIG. In the aerospace markets served by EIG, a limited number of companies compete on the basis of product quality, performance and innovation. EMG's competition in specialty metal products stems from alternative materials and processes. Our competitors may develop new or improve existing products that are superior to our products or may adapt more readily to new technologies or changing requirements of our customers. There can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by increased competition in the markets in which it operates or that our products will be able to compete successfully with those of our competitors.

## Our business and financial performance could be adversely impacted by a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems.

We rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information (including sensitive data such as confidential business information and personally identifiable data relating to employees, customers, other business partners and patients), and to monitor, manage, and support a variety of critical business processes and activities including receiving and fulfilling orders, billing, collecting and making payments, shipping products, providing services and support to customers and fulfilling contractual obligations. Despite our implementation of certain controls to protect our systems and sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, these systems, products, data and services may be damaged, compromised, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, ransomware, human error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. In any such circumstances our system redundancy and other disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. Further, we also face information security risks due to our reliance on internet technology and use of hybrid work arrangements, which could strain our technology resources or create additional opportunity for cyber-attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.

Attacks may also target hardware, software and information installed, stored or transmitted in our products after such products have been purchased and incorporated into third-party products, facilities or infrastructure. Like most multinational corporations, our information technology systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access and other cyber-attacks and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such attacks to continue to increase. Any of the attacks, breaches or other disruptions or damage described above could interrupt our operations or the operations of our customers and partners, delay production and shipments, result in theft of intellectual property and trade secrets, damage customer and business partner relationships and our reputation or result in defective products or services, legal claims and proceedings, liability and penalties under privacy laws and increased costs for security and remediation, each of which could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. Further, given the increasing sophistication of cyber-attacks and the complexity of techniques used, any of these attacks or breaches could potentially persist for an extended period before being detected. As a result, it could take a significant time before an investigation can be completed and new disclosure regulations could result in us being required to disclose information about a material cybersecurity incident before it has been mitigated or resolved, or even fully investigated. Although we maintain cyber risk insurance, damages and claims arising from such incidents may not be covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available.

## Risks Related to Our Acquisitions

## Our growth strategy includes strategic acquisitions. We may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or successfully integrate recent and future acquisitions.

A portion of our growth has been attributed to acquisitions of strategic businesses. We plan to continue making strategic acquisitions to enhance our global market position and broaden our product offerings. Although we have been successful with our acquisition strategy in the past, our ability to successfully effectuate acquisitions will be dependent upon a number of factors, including:

- · Our ability to identify acceptable acquisition candidates;
- · The impact of increased competition for acquisitions, which may increase acquisition costs, affect our ability to consummate acquisitions on favorable terms, and result in us assuming a greater portion of the seller's liabilities;
- · Successfully integrating acquired businesses, including integrating the management, technological and operational processes, procedures and controls of the acquired businesses with those of our existing operations;
- · Adequate financing for acquisitions being available on terms acceptable to us;
- · Unexpected losses of key employees, customers and suppliers of acquired businesses;
- · Mitigating assumed, contingent and unknown liabilities; and
- · Challenges in managing the increased scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations.

The process of integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require additional financial resources and attention from management that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations. Furthermore, even if successfully integrated, the acquired business may not achieve the results we expected or produce expected benefits in the time frame planned. Failure to continue with our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

## The indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities.

Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited, and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We may also obtain representation and warranty insurance to address certain potential risks and liabilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions and insurance policies will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements.

## Risks Related to Our Financial Condition

Certain environmental risks may cause us to be liable for costs associated with hazardous or toxic substance clean-up which may adversely affect our financial condition.

Our businesses, operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, air

## Table of Contents

emissions, discharges to waters and the use, manufacturing, generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. Environmental risks are inherent in many of our manufacturing operations. Certain laws provide that a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of investigating, removing and remediating hazardous materials at such property, regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous materials. In addition, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act generally imposes joint and several liability for clean-up costs, without regard to fault, on parties contributing hazardous substances to sites designated for clean-up under the Act. We have been named a potentially responsible party at several sites, which are the subject of government-mandated clean-ups. As the result of our ownership and operation of facilities that use, manufacture, store, handle and dispose of various hazardous materials, we may incur substantial costs for investigation, removal, remediation and capital expenditures related to compliance with environmental laws. While it is not possible to precisely quantify the potential financial impact of pending environmental matters, based on our experience to date, we believe that the outcome of these matters is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations. In addition, new laws and regulations, new classification of hazardous materials, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that future environmental liabilities will not occur or that environmental damages due to prior or present practices will not result in future liabilities.

## We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in the course of our business that could adversely affect our financial statements.

We are subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to our business (or the business operations of previously owned entities), including claims for damages arising out of the use of products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition-related matters, as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement. These lawsuits may include claims for compensatory damages, punitive and consequential damages and/or injunctive relief. The defense of these lawsuits may divert our management's attention, we may incur significant expenses in defending these lawsuits, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements or become subject to equitable remedies that could adversely affect our operations and financial statements. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against such losses. In addition, developments in proceedings in any given period may require us to adjust the loss contingency estimates that we have recorded in our financial statements, record estimates for liabilities or assets previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates or pay cash settlements or judgments. Any of these developments could adversely affect our financial statements in any particular period. We cannot assure you that our liabilities in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation. However, based on our experience, current information and applicable law, we do not believe that any amounts we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings in excess of our reserves will have a material effect on our financial statements.

## Restrictions contained in our revolving credit facility and other debt agreements may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness.

Our existing revolving credit facility and other debt agreements (each a "Debt Facility" and collectively, "Debt Facilities") contain restrictive covenants, including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness. These restrictions could limit our ability to effectuate future acquisitions, limit our ability to pay dividends, limit our ability to make capital expenditures or restrict our financial flexibility. Our Debt Facilities contain covenants requiring us to achieve certain financial and operating results and maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our Debt Facilities may be affected by events beyond our control, and we may not be able to satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the financial ratios, tests or other restrictions contained in a Debt Facility could result in an event of default under one or more of our other Debt Facilities. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under a Debt

## Table of Contents

Facility, and the expiration of any grace periods, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under one or more of our other Debt Facilities, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, our assets may not be sufficient to fully repay the amounts due under our Debt Facilities or our other indebtedness.

Our goodwill and other intangible assets represent a substantial proportion of our total assets and the impairment of such substantial goodwill and intangible assets could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

Our total assets include substantial amounts of intangible assets, primarily goodwill. At December 31, 2023, goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $10,612.9 million or 71% of our total assets. The goodwill results from our acquisitions, representing the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and other identifiable intangible assets we have acquired. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units were to fall significantly below current levels, we could record, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating income for goodwill or other intangible asset impairment. Any determination requiring the impairment of a significant portion of goodwill or other intangible assets would negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.

## Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments

None.

## Item 1C. Cybersecurity

AMETEK's cybersecurity risk management practices are based on the widely recognized National Institute of Standards and Technology Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity (The NIST Cybersecurity Framework and the NIST 800-171 Revision 2 Standard). This guidance was developed with private sector input and provides a framework and toolkit for organizations to manage cybersecurity risk.

We utilize a broad team of in-house information technology and security personnel, as well as third-party consultants, services and software, to help manage our cybersecurity efforts and initiatives. We regularly assess our threat landscape and monitor our systems and other technical security controls. Additionally, we maintain information security policies and procedures, including a breach response plan and maintenance of backup and protective systems.

We regularly review our policies, practices, and plans with assistance from third-party experts and advisors. Our Chief Information Officer is responsible for corporate-wide data security. Our management team is actively engaged in regular reviews of cyber risks. Additionally, our full Board of Directors receives quarterly briefings on enterprise-wide cybersecurity risk management and our overall cybersecurity risk environment.

We have implemented two risk management groups, the Enterprise Risk Management Committee, and the Cybersecurity Steering Committee. These committees meet quarterly. They are responsible for the overall governance of our cyber management. The implementation of the Cyber polices and strategy is the responsibility of the Chief Information Officer and the Director of Cyber Security. The CIO reports to the Chief Administrative Officer and the Director of Cyber Security reports to the CIO. We also have a team of full-time cybersecurity specialists who hold various industry technology accreditations. The CIO has more than 35 years in Senior IT Leadership positions, and the Director of Cyber Security has more than 30 years IT experience overall, 15 of which are in leadership roles.

Operationally, we deploy multiple layers of cyber defenses including multiple tools and processes that identify security risks across our global networks, largely in real time. We also maintain good relationships with law enforcement agencies to remain informed on potential cyber risks.

## Table of Contents

Mandatory cybersecurity training is conducted eight times a year for all of AMETEK's employees with email access. The training provides critical information on how employees can protect themselves and AMETEK against cybersecurity risks. AMETEK financial professionals receive additional training due to the nature of their roles.

## Item 2. Properties

At December 31, 2023, the Company conducted business from office and operating facilities at owned and leased locations throughout the United States and select global markets. The Company leases a facility in Berwyn, Pennsylvania for its corporate headquarters.

The Company believes that all facilities have been adequately maintained, are in good operating condition, and are suitable for our current needs.

## Item 3. Legal Proceedings

Please refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding certain litigation matters.

The Company is subject to a variety of litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings incidental to its business (or the business operations of previously owned entities), including claims for damages arising out of the use of the Company's products or services and claims relating to intellectual property matters, employment matters, tax matters, commercial disputes, competition and sales and trading practices, environmental matters, personal injury, insurance coverage and acquisition-related matters, as well as regulatory investigations or enforcement. Based upon the Company's experience, the Company does not believe that these proceedings and claims will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

## PART II

## Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

The principal market on which the Company's common stock is traded is the New York Stock Exchange and it is traded under the symbol "AME." On January 31, 2024, there were approximately 1,700 holders of record of the Company's common stock.

Market price and dividend information with respect to the Company's common stock is set forth below. Future dividend payments by the Company will be dependent on future earnings, financial requirements, contractual provisions of debt agreements and other relevant factors.

Under its share repurchase program, the Company repurchased approximately 55,800 shares of its common stock for $7.8 million in 2023 and approximately 2,673,000 shares of its common stock for $332.8 million in 2022.

The objective and rationale of the share repurchases is to enhance shareholder value through the opportunistic repurchases of the Company's common stock. The Company takes a balanced approach when determining how to deploy capital, including strategic acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases. The factors evaluated when considering how to deploy capital include: the Company's share price, the Company's cash balances, balance sheet flexibility, business prospects, the leverage of the Company, and other investment opportunities.

## Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

This report includes forward-looking statements based on the Company's current assumptions, expectations and projections about future events. When used in this report, the words "believes," "anticipates," "may," "expect," "intend," "estimate," "project" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such words. In this report, the Company discloses important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from management's expectations. For more information on these and other factors, see "Forward-Looking Information" herein.

The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with "Item 1A. Risk Factors," and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Business Overview

AMETEK's operations are affected by global, regional and industry-specific economic factors. However, the Company's strategic geographic and industry diversification, and its mix of products and services, have helped to mitigate the potential adverse impact of any unfavorable developments in any one industry or the economy of any single country on its consolidated operating results. In 2023, the Company posted record sales, operating income, operating margins, net income, diluted earnings per share, orders, backlog, and operating cash flow. Positive market trends, the Company's record backlog, contributions from recent acquisitions, and continued focus on and implementation of Operational Excellence initiatives had a positive impact on 2023 results. The Company also benefited from its strategic initiatives under AMETEK's four key strategies: Operational Excellence, Strategic Acquisitions, Global & Market Expansion and New Products.

## Highlights in 2023 were:

- · Net sales for 2023 were a record $6,597.0 million, an increase of $446.5 million or 7.3%, compared with net sales of $6,150.5 million in 2022. The increase in net sales for 2023 was due to a 4% organic sales increase and a 3% increase from acquisitions.

## Environmental Matters

Information with respect to environmental matters is set forth in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Critical accounting policies are those policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based on the Company's historical experience and management's judgment. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ materially from the estimates used. Below are the policies used in preparing the Company's financial statements that management believes are the most dependent upon the application of estimates and assumptions. A complete list of the Company's significant accounting policies is in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

- · Business Combinations. The Company allocates the purchase price of an acquired company, including when applicable, the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values, with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. Third party appraisal firms and other consultants are engaged to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. In the absence of a third party appraisal, the Company uses internal valuation estimates based on pertinent data from comparable prior acquisitions . Estimating fair values requires significant judgments, estimates and assumptions, including but not limited to: discount rates, future cash flows and the economic lives of trade names, technology, and customer relationships. These estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain.
- · Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily trademarks and trade names, are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually. The Company performs either a qualitative or quantitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units.
- When testing goodwill for impairment, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely

=== SUBSET BREAK ===

## Table of Contents

than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company performs a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not, then performance of a quantitative impairment test is required. In conducting a qualitative assessment, the Company analyzes actual and forecasted net sales and selling profit for each reporting unit, as well as historical performance and the results of prior quantitative tests performed. Additionally, the Company assesses critical areas that may impact its business, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, or any relevant events and factors that may impact projected financial results.

If performed, the quantitative goodwill impairment test uses a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit, which considers cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate. The annual goodwill impairment test requires the Company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, operating margins, depreciation, amortization and working capital requirements, which are based on the Company's long-range plan and are considered level 3 inputs. The discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt, including a risk premium. While the Company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances.

The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily trademarks and trade names) consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. The Company can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those assets. The Company elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen. The Company may elect to perform the qualitative analysis in future periods. The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty method using level 3 inputs, which is a widely used valuation technique for such assets. The fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is determined by applying a royalty rate to a projection of net revenues discounted using an appropriate discount rate. Each royalty rate is determined based on the profitability of the trade name to which it relates and observed market royalty rates. Certain impairment models have discount rates calculated based on a debt/equity cost of capital. While the Company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded intangible balances. While there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions, the Company's overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged.

The Company's acquisitions have generally included a significant goodwill component and the Company expects to continue to make acquisitions. At December 31, 2023, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets totaled $7,471.4 million or 49.7% of the Company's total assets. The Company completed its required annual qualitative goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2023 and determined that the carrying values of the Company's goodwill was not impaired. The Company completed its required annual indefinite-lived intangibles impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2023 and determined that the carrying values of certain of the Company's indefinite-lived intangibles were impaired primarily as a result of higher discount rates associated with higher interest rates, as well as decreased forecasted sales growth of specific product lines. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company recorded an immaterial non-cash impairment charge related to certain of the Company's trade names. There can be no assurance that goodwill or indefinite-lived intangibles impairment will not occur in the future.

- · Pensions. The Company has U.S. and foreign defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. The most significant elements in determining the Company's pension income or expense are the assumed pension liability discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. The pension discount rate reflects the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be settled at the valuation date. At the end of each

## Table of Contents

- year, the Company determines the assumed discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities. In estimating this rate for 2023, the Company considered rates of return on high-quality, fixed-income investments that have maturities consistent with the anticipated funding requirements of the plan. In estimating the U.S. and foreign discount rates, the Company's actuaries developed a customized discount rate appropriate to the plans' projected benefit cash flow based on yields derived from a database of long-term bonds at consistent maturity dates. The Company determines the expected long-term rate of return based primarily on its expectation of future returns for the pension plans' investments. Additionally, the Company considers historical returns on comparable fixed-income and equity investments and adjusts its estimate as deemed appropriate.
- · Income Taxes. The process of providing for income taxes and determining the related balance sheet accounts requires management to assess uncertainties, make judgments regarding outcomes and utilize estimates. The Company conducts a broad range of operations around the world and is therefore subject to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. Management must make judgments currently about such uncertainties and determine estimates of the Company's tax assets and liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs, future adjustments to the Company's tax assets and liabilities may be necessary.
- The Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets, taking into consideration the Company's forecast of future taxable income, available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and the amount of, valuation allowances against the Company's deferred tax assets. To the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required.

The Company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions, by applying a minimum recognition threshold which a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. Once the minimum threshold is met, using a more likely than not standard, a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit. The tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50% likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination. The underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes, published guidance, external expert opinion, or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past. There can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy, legislation and audit practice. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.

## Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 2, Recent Accounting Pronouncements, to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements.

## Forward-Looking Information

Certain matters discussed in this Form 10-K are "forward-looking statements" as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ("PSLRA"), which involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the Company's operations and business environment and can be affected by inaccurate assumptions, or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many such factors will be important in determining the Company's actual future results. The Company wishes to take advantage of the "safe harbor" provisions of the PSLRA by cautioning readers that numerous important factors in some cases have caused, and in the future could cause, the Company's actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements made by, or on behalf of, the Company. Some, but not all, of the factors or uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from present expectations are set forth above and under Item 1A. Risk Factors. The Company undertakes no obligation to

## Table of Contents

publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, subsequent events or otherwise, unless required by the securities laws to do so.

## Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

The Company's primary exposures to market risk are fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices, which could impact its financial condition and results of operations. The Company addresses its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities. The Company's differentiated and global business activities help to reduce the impact that any particular market risk may have on its operating income as a whole.

The Company's short-term debt carries variable interest rates and generally its long-term debt carries fixed rates. These financial instruments are more fully described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The foreign currencies to which the Company has the most significant exchange rate exposure are the Euro, the British pound, the Japanese yen, the Chinese renminbi, the Canadian dollar, and the Mexican peso. Exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuation is modest, monitored, and when possible, mitigated through the use of local borrowings and occasional derivative financial instruments in the foreign currency affected. The effect of translating foreign subsidiaries' balance sheets into U.S. dollars is included in other comprehensive income within stockholders' equity. Foreign currency transactions have not had a significant effect on the operating results reported by the Company because revenues and costs associated with the revenues are generally transacted in the same foreign currencies.

The primary commodities to which the Company has market exposure are raw material purchases of nickel, aluminum, copper, steel, titanium, and gold. Exposure to price changes in these commodities are generally mitigated through adjustments in selling prices of the ultimate product and purchase order pricing arrangements, although forward contracts are sometimes used to manage some of those exposures.

Based on a hypothetical ten percent adverse movement in interest rates, commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates, the Company's best estimate is that the potential losses in future earnings, fair value of risk-sensitive financial instruments and cash flows are not material, although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis.

## Management's Responsibility for Financial Statements

Management has prepared and is responsible for the integrity of the consolidated financial statements and related information. The statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied and include certain amounts based on management's best estimates and judgments. Historical financial information elsewhere in this report is consistent with that in the financial statements.

In meeting its responsibility for the reliability of the financial information, management maintains a system of internal accounting and disclosure controls, including an internal audit program. The system of controls provides for appropriate division of responsibility and the application of written policies and procedures. That system, which undergoes continual reevaluation, is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, and records are adequate for the preparation of reliable financial data.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. AMETEK, Inc. maintains a system of internal controls that is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the fair and reliable preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements; however, there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal controls.

Management recognizes its responsibility for conducting the Company's activities according to the highest standards of personal and corporate conduct. That responsibility is characterized and reflected in a code of business conduct for all employees and in a financial code of ethics for the Chief Executive Officer and Senior Financial Officers, as well as in other key policy statements publicized throughout the Company.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of independent directors who are not employees of the Company, meets with the independent registered public accounting firm, the internal auditors and management to satisfy itself that each is properly discharging its responsibilities. The report of the Audit Committee is included in the Company's Proxy Statement for the 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Both the independent registered public accounting firm and the internal auditors have direct access to the Audit Committee.

The Company's independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, is engaged to render an opinion as to whether management's financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the Company's financial position and operating results. This report is included herein.

## Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, AMETEK, Inc. conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2023.

The Company acquired Bison Gear & Engineering Corp. ("Bison") in March 2023, United Electronic Industries ("UEI") in August 2023, Amplifier Research Corp. ("Amplifier Research") in October 2023, and Paragon Medical ("Paragon") in December 2023. As permitted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission staff interpretative guidance for newly acquired businesses, the Company excluded Bison, UEI, Amplifier Research, and Paragon from management's assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. Bison, UEI, Amplifier Research, and Paragon constituted 15.8% of total assets as of December 31, 2023 and 1.7% of net sales for the year then ended.

The Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.

## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of AMETEK, Inc.

## Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited AMETEK, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, AMETEK, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on the COSO criteria.

As indicated in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting , management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Bison Gear & Engineering, United Electronic Industries, Amplifier Research Corp., and Paragon Medical, which are included in the 2023 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 15.8% of total assets as of December 31, 2023 and 1.7% of net sales for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Bison Gear & Engineering, United Electronic Industries, Amplifier Research Corp., and Paragon Medical.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of AMETEK, Inc. as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes and our report dated February 22, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

## Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting . Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

## Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of AMETEK, Inc.:

## Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AMETEK, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 22, 2024 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

## Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

## Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

| Description of the Matter | Impairment Assessment of Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets (other than Goodwill) At December 31, 2023, the Company's indefinite lived intangible assets (other than goodwill) totaled $1,023.8 million, consisting of trademarks and trade names. As described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually in the Company's fourth quarter. |
| --- | --- |
| | Auditing management's indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests was complex and highly judgmental due to the significant measurement uncertainty in estimating the fair value of the trademarks and trade names. In particular, the fair value estimates were sensitive to significant assumptions such as discount rate, forecasted revenues and royalty rates, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions. |
| How We Addressed the Matter in | |
| Our Audit | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's indefinite lived intangible asset impairment process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the valuation models and significant assumptions, including forecasted financial information, as well as management's controls to validate that the data used in the valuations was complete and accurate. |
| | To test the estimated fair value of the Company's indefinite lived intangible assets, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the fair value methodologies utilized by management and the significant assumptions discussed above, including the underlying data used in the analyses. For example, when evaluating the significant assumptions, we compared them to current financial and operating plans, market and industry studies, historical trends, and royalty rates used in prior periods. We also assessed the historical accuracy of management's forecasts and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value estimates of the trademarks and trade names that would result from changes in the assumptions. We involved our valuation specialists to assist in evaluating the discount rate, |

Accounting for the Provisional Fair Value of the Intangibles from the Acquisition of Paragon Medical As described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the acquisition of Paragon Medical in December 2023 |
| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit | purchase accounting. The key inputs to the fair value of the intangible assets of Paragon Medical included the comparison of the revenue growth and profitability of Paragon Medical compared to similar previous acquisitions by the Company. We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's estimation of the fair value of the acquired intangible assets of Paragon Medical. For example, we tested controls over the valuation of acquired identifiable intangible assets including controls over management's review of the key inputs described above. |

1. Significant Accounting Policies

______________________________________________________________________

## Basis of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of AMETEK, Inc. (the "Company"), and include the accounts of the Company and subsidiaries, after elimination of all intercompany transactions in the consolidation.

## Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions.

## Cash Equivalents, Securities and Other Investments

All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents.

## Accounts Receivable

The Company maintains allowances for estimated credit losses resulting from the inability of customers to meet their financial obligations to the Company. The Company recognizes an allowance for credit losses, on all accounts receivable and contract assets, which considers risk of future credit losses based on factors such as historical experience, contract terms, as well as general and market business conditions, country, and political risk. Balances are written off when considered uncollectible. Bad debt expense was $4.0 million in 2023, $3.7 million in 2022 and $1.2 million in 2021. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the allowance for estimated credit losses was $13.2 million and $14.1 million, respectively.

## Inventories

The Company predominantly uses the first-in, first-out ("FIFO") method of inventory accounting, which approximates current replacement cost, at December 31, 2023. The last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method of accounting is used to determine cost for 9% of the Company's inventory at December 31, 2023. For inventories where cost is determined by the LIFO method, the FIFO value would have been $39.0 million and $40.3 million higher than the LIFO value reported in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company provides estimated inventory reserves for slow-moving and obsolete inventory based on current assessments about future demand, market conditions, customers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and related management initiatives.

## Business Combinations

The Company allocates the purchase price of an acquired company, including when applicable, the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values, with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of the acquired business are included in the Company's operating results from the date of acquisition.

## Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for additions to plant facilities, or that extend their useful lives, are capitalized. The cost of minor tools, jigs and dies, and maintenance and repairs is charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation of plant and equipment is calculated principally on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. The range of lives for depreciable assets is generallythree to 10 years for machinery and equipment,five to 27 years for leasehold improvements and 25 to 50 years for buildings.

## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -(Continued)

Depreciation expense was $122.5 million, $113.7 million and $108.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

## Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, primarily trademarks and trade names, are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually.

The Company identifies its reporting units at the component level, which is one level below its operating segments. Generally, goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which the operating company resides. The Company's reporting units are divisions that are one level below its operating segments and for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management.

When testing goodwill for impairment, the Company has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company performs a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not, then performance of a quantitative impairment test is required. In conducting a qualitative assessment, the Company analyzes actual and forecasted net sales and selling profit for each reporting unit, as well as historical performance and the results of prior quantitative tests performed. Additionally, the Company assesses critical areas that may impact its business, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, or any relevant events and factors that may impact projected financial results.

If performed, the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed using a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit, which considers cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate. The annual goodwill impairment test requires the Company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, operating margins, depreciation, amortization and working capital requirements, which are based on the Company's long-range plan and are considered level 3 inputs. The discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt, including a risk premium. While the Company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances.

During the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company completed its annual goodwill impairment tests and elected to perform a qualitative assessment.

The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (primarily trademarks and trade names) consists of a comparison of the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinitelived intangibles using the relief from royalty method using level 3 inputs for revenue growth rates and royalty rates. The fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use.

The Company completed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of 2023, 2022, and 2021 and determined that the carrying values of the Company's goodwill were not impaired. The Company completed its required annual indefinite-lived intangibles impairment test as of October 1, 2023 and determined that the carrying values of certain of the Company's trademarks and trade names with indefinite lives were impaired primarily as a result of higher discount rates associated with higher interest rates, as well as decreased forecasted sales growth of specific product lines. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company recorded an immaterial non-cash impairment charge related to certain of the Company's trade names. The Company completed its required annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2022 and determined that the carrying values of certain of the Company's trademarks and trade names with indefinite lives were impaired and as a result, during the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company recorded an immaterial non-cash impairment charge related to certain of the Company's trade names. The

## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -(Continued)

Company completed its required annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2021 and determined that the carrying values of the Company's other intangible assets with indefinite lives were not impaired.

Other intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. The carrying value of other intangible assets with finite lives is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from the asset group are less than the carrying value. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of those assets. Fair value is determined primarily using present value techniques based on projected cash flows from the asset group.

Intangible assets, other than goodwill, with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Patents and technology are being amortized over useful lives of nine to 20 years, with a weighted average life of 14 years. Customer relationships are being amortized over a period often to 20 years, with a weighted average life of 19 years. On a quarterly basis, the Company evaluates the reasonableness of the estimated useful lives of these intangible assets.

## Financial Instruments and Foreign Currency Translation

Assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and their results of operations are translated using average exchange rates for the year. Certain transactions of the Company and its subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency. Exchange gains and losses from those transactions are included in operating results for the year.

The Company makes infrequent use of derivative financial instruments. Forward contracts are primarily entered into from time to time to hedge debt or foreign currency transactions, thereby minimizing the Company's exposure to foreign currency fluctuation.

In instances where transactions are designated as hedges of an underlying item, the gains and losses on those transactions are included in accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders' equity to the extent they are effective as hedges. An evaluation of hedge effectiveness is performed by the Company at inception and on an ongoing basis and any changes in the hedge are made as appropriate.

## Leases

The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. This determination generally depends on whether the arrangement conveys to the Company the right to control the use of an explicitly or implicitly identified fixed asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company has lease agreements which include lease and non-lease components, which the Company has elected to account for as a single lease component for all classes of underlying assets. Lease expense for variable lease components are recognized when the obligation is probable.

Operating leases are included in right-of-use ("ROU") assets, accrued liabilities and other, and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Operating lease payments are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company primarily leases buildings (real estate) and automobiles which are classified as operating leases.

The lease term for all of the Company's leases includes the non-cancellable period of the lease plus any additional periods covered by either a Company option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, or an option to extend (or not to terminate) the lease controlled by the lessor. Options for lease renewals have been excluded from the lease term (and lease liability) for the majority of the Company's leases as the reasonably certain threshold is not met.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability are comprised of fixed and variable payments that depend on an index or rate.

## Table of Contents

## AMETEK, Inc.

## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -(Continued)

Variable lease payments not dependent on a rate or index associated with the Company's leases are recognized when the events, activities, or circumstances in the lease agreement on which those payments are assessed are probable. Variable lease payments are presented as operating expense in the Company's income statement in the same line item as expense arising from fixed lease payments. Cash used in operations for operating leases is not materially different than total lease costs.

## Revenue Recognition

Revenue is derived from sales of products and services. The Company's products and services are marketed and sold worldwide throughtwo operating groups: EIG and EMG. See Note 15 Descriptive Information about Reportable Segments.

The majority of the Company's revenues on product sales were recognized at a point in time when the customer obtains control of the product. The transfer in control of the product to the customer was typically evidenced by one or more of the following: the customer having legal title to the product, the Company's present right to payment, the customer's physical possession of the product, the customer accepting the product, or the customer having the benefits of ownership or risk of loss. For a small percentage of sales where title and risk of loss transfers at the point of delivery, the Company recognized revenue upon delivery to the customer, which is the point that control transferred, assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition were met.

The Company determined that revenues from certain of its customer contracts met the criteria of satisfying its performance obligations over time, primarily in the areas of the manufacture of custom-made equipment and for service repairs of customer-owned equipment. Recognizing revenue over time for custom-manufactured equipment is based on the Company's judgment that, in certain contracts, the product does not have an alternative use and the Company has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.

The Company recognizes incremental cost of obtaining contracts as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the contract cost assets that the Company would have otherwise recognized is one year or less. These costs are included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income.

The determination of the revenue to be recognized in each period for performance obligations satisfied over time is based on the input method. The Company recognizes revenue over time as it performs on these contracts because the transfer of control to the customer occurs over time. Revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The Company generally uses the total cost-to-cost input method of progress because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as costs are incurred. Under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. On certain contracts, labor hours are used as the measure of progress when it is determined to be a better depiction of the transfer of control to the customer due to the timing and pattern of labor hours incurred.

Performance obligations also include post-delivery service, installation and training. Post-delivery service revenues are recognized over the contract term. Installation and training revenues are recognized over the period the service is provided. Warranty terms in customer contracts can also be considered separate performance obligations if the warranty provides services beyond assurance that a product complies with agreed-upon specification or if a warranty can be purchased separately. The Company does not incur significant obligations for customer returns and refunds.

The Company has certain contracts with variable consideration in the form of volume discounts, rebates and early payment options, which may affect the transaction price used as the basis for revenue recognition.

Payment terms generally begin upon shipment of the product. The Company does have contracts with multiple billing terms that are all due within one year from when the product is delivered. No significant financing component exists. Payment terms are generally 30-60 days from the time of shipment or customer acceptance, but

## Table of Contents

## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -(Continued)

terms can be shorter or longer, not exceeding one year. For customer contracts that have revenue recognized over time, revenue is generally recognized prior to a payment being due from the customer. In such cases, the Company recognizes a contract asset at the time the revenue is recognized. When payment becomes due based on the contract terms, the Company reduces the contract asset and records a receivable. In contracts with billing milestones or in other instances with a long production cycle or concerns about credit, customer advance payments are received. The Company may receive a payment in excess of revenue recognized to that date. In these circumstances, a contract liability is recorded. Contract liabilities are derecognized when the performance obligations are satisfied, and revenue is recognized.

## Research and Development

Research and development costs are included in Cost of sales as incurred and were $220.8 million in 2023, $198.8 million in 2022 and $194.2 million in 2021.

## Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs are included in Cost of sales and were $77.9 million in 2023, $103.7 million in 2022 and $86.1 million in 2021.

## Share-Based Compensation

The Company expenses the fair value of share-based awards made under its share-based plans in the consolidated financial statements over their requisite service period of the grants.

## Income Taxes

The Company conducts a broad range of operations around the world and is therefore subject to complex tax regulations in numerous international taxing jurisdictions, resulting at times in tax audits, disputes and potential litigation, the outcome of which is uncertain. Management must make judgments currently about such uncertainties and determine estimates of the Company's tax assets and liabilities. To the extent the final outcome differs, future adjustments to the Company's tax assets and liabilities may be necessary.

The Company assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets, taking into consideration the Company's forecast of future taxable income, available net operating loss carryforwards and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, management must evaluate the need for, and amount of, valuation allowances against the Company's deferred tax assets. To the extent facts and circumstances change in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances may be required.

The Company assesses the uncertainty in its tax positions, by applying a minimum recognition threshold which a tax position is required to meet before a tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. Once the minimum threshold is met, using a more likely than not standard, a series of probability estimates is made for each item to properly measure and record a tax benefit. The tax benefit recorded is generally equal to the highest probable outcome that is more than 50% likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination. The underlying probabilities are determined based on the best available objective evidence such as recent tax audit outcomes, published guidance, external expert opinion, or by analogy to the outcome of similar issues in the past. There can be no assurance that these estimates will ultimately be realized given continuous changes in tax policy, legislation and audit practice. The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.

## Pensions

The Company has U.S. and foreign defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans. The key assumptions in determining the Company's pension income or expense are the assumed pension liability discount rate and the expected return on plan assets. All unrecognized prior service costs, remaining transition obligations or assets and actuarial gains and losses have been recognized, net of tax effects, as a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders' equity and will be amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost. The Company uses a measurement date of December 31 (its fiscal year end) for its U.S. and foreign defined benefit plans.

## Earnings Per Share

The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares considered outstanding during the periods. The calculation of diluted earnings per share reflects the effect of all potentially dilutive securities (principally outstanding stock options and restricted stock grants). The number of weighted average shares used in the calculation of basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share was as follows for the years ended December 31:

Table of Contents

| | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | (In thousands) | (In thousands) | (In thousands) |
| Weighted average shares: | | | |
| Basic shares | 230,519 | 230,208 | 230,955 |
| Equity-based compensation plans | 990 | 1,328 | 1,858 |
| Diluted shares | 231,509 | 231,536 | 232,813 |

The calculation of diluted earnings per share for 2022 excluded an immaterial number of stock options because the exercise prices of these stock options exceeded the average market price of the Company's common shares, and the effect of their inclusion would have been antidilutive. There were no antidilutive shares in 2023 and 2021.

2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements

______________________________________________________________________

## Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures ("ASU 2023-07"), which requires disclosure of significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis under ASC 280.

3. Revenues

______________________________________________________________________

The outstanding contract asset and liability accounts were as follows:

Table of Contents

| | 2023 | 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| | (In thousands) | (In thousands) |
| Contract assets - January 1 | $ 119,741 | $ 95,274 |
| Contract assets - December 31 | 140,826 | 119,741 |
| Change in contract assets - increase | 21,085 | 24,467 |
| Contract liabilities - January 1 | 398,692 | 328,816 |
| Contract liabilities - December 31 | 432,830 | 398,692 |
| Change in contract liabilities - (increase) | (34,138) | (69,876) |
| Net change | $ (13,053) | $ (45,409) |

The net change in 2023 and 2022 was primarily driven by the receipt of advance payments from customers exceeding the recognition of revenue and customer advance payments from acquired businesses. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized revenue of $345 million and $272 million, respectively, that was previously included in the beginning balance of contract liabilities.

Contract assets are reported as a component of Other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, $57.3 million and $41.0 million, respectively, of Customer advanced payments (contract liabilities) were recorded in Other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.

The remaining performance obligations exceeding one year as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $607.5 million and $526.0 million, respectively. Remaining performance obligations represent the transaction price of firm, non-cancelable orders, with expected delivery dates to customers greater than one year from the balance sheet date, for which the performance obligation is unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied. These performance obligations will be substantially satisfied within two to three years.

## Geographic Areas

Net sales were attributed to geographic areas based on the location of the customer. Information about the Company's operations in different geographic areas was as follows for the year ended December 31:

## Product Warranties

The Company provides limited warranties in connection with the sale of its products. The warranty periods for products sold vary among the Company's operations, but the majority do not exceed one year. The Company calculates its warranty expense provision based on its historical warranty experience and adjustments are made periodically to reflect actual warranty expenses. Product warranty obligations are reported as a component of Accrued liabilities and other in the consolidated balance sheet.

Changes in the accrued product warranty obligation were as follows:

4. Fair Value Measurements

______________________________________________________________________

Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Company utilizes a hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to the valuations used to measure fair value. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows:

Level 1 - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

Level 2 - quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument

Level 3 - unobservable inputs based on the Company's own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value

A financial asset or liability's classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

The following tables provide the Company's assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31:

| | 2023 | 2023 | 2023 | 2023 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Total | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 |
| | (In thousands) | (In thousands) | (In thousands) | (In thousands) |
| Mutual fund investments | $ 11,922 | $ 11,922 | $ - | $ - |
| Foreign currency forward contracts | 2,035 | - | 2,035 | - |

Table of Contents

| | 2022 | 2022 | 2022 | 2022 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | Total | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 |
| | (In thousands) | (In thousands) | (In thousands) | (In thousands) |
| Mutual fund investments | $ 9,856 | $ 9,856 | $ - | $ - |
| Foreign currency forward contracts | 3,032 | - | 3,032 | - |

The fair value of mutual fund investments is based on quoted market prices. The mutual fund investments are shown as a component of long-term assets in the consolidated balance sheet. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, gains and losses on the investments were not significant.

## Foreign Currency

At December 31, 2023, the Company had a Euro forward contract for a notional value of50.0 million Euros. At December 31, 2022 the Company had a Euro forward contract for a total notional value of 40.0 million Euros and a Canadian dollar forward contract for a notional value of26.5 million Canadian dollars. Foreign currency forward contracts are valued as level 2 assets as they are corroborated by foreign currency exchange rates and shown as a component of other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet. For the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, realized gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts were not significant. The Company does not typically designate its foreign currency forward contracts as accounting hedges.

## Financial Instruments

Cash, cash equivalents and mutual fund investments are recorded at fair value at December 31, 2023 and 2022 in the consolidated balance sheet.

The fair value of short-term borrowings, net approximates the carrying value. The Company's long-term debt, net is all privately held with no public market for this debt, therefore, the fair value of long-term debt, net was computed based on comparable current market data for similar debt instruments and is considered to be a level 3 liability. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the fair value of long-term debt (including current portion) was $2,087.6 million and $2,010.9 million and the recorded amount of long-term debt (including current portion) was $2,197.5 million and $2,161.6 million, respectively. See Note 10 for long-term debt principal amounts, interest rates and maturities.

5. Hedging Activities

______________________________________________________________________

The Company has designated certain foreign-currency-denominated long-term borrowings as hedges of the net investment in certain foreign operations. As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, these net investment hedges included British-pound and Euro-denominated long-term debt. These borrowings were designed to create net investment hedges in each of the designated foreign subsidiaries. The Company designated the British-pound- and Euro-denominated loans referred to above as hedging instruments to offset translation gains or losses on the net investment due to changes in the British pound and Euro exchange rates. These net investment hedges are evidenced by management's contemporaneous documentation supporting the hedge designation. Any gain or loss on the hedging instruments (the debt) following hedge designation is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income in the same manner as the translation adjustment on the hedged investment based on changes in the spot rate, which is used to measure hedge effectiveness.

At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $286.6 million and $271.7 million, respectively, of British-pound denominated loans, which were designated as a hedge against the net investment in British pound functional currency foreign subsidiaries. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company had $580.8 million and $572.1 million, respectively, in Euro-denominated loans, which were designated as a hedge against the net investment in Euro functional currency foreign subsidiaries. As a result of the British-pound and Euro-denominated loans being designated and 100% effective as net investment hedges, $32.8 million of pre-tax currency remeasurement losses and $69.5 million of pre-tax currency remeasurement gains have been included in the foreign currency translation component of other comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

6. Acquisitions

______________________________________________________________________

The Company spent $2,237.9 million in cash, net of cash acquired, to acquire Paragon Medical ("Paragon") in December 2023, Amplifier Research Corp. ("Amplifier Research") in October 2023, United Electronic Industries ("UEI") in August 2023, and Bison Gear & Engineering Corp. ("Bison") in March 2023. Paragon is a leading provider of highly engineered medical components and instruments. Amplifier Research is a leading manufacturer of radio frequency and microwave amplifiers and electromagnetic compatibility testing equipment. Bison is a leading manufacturer of highly engineered motion control solutions serving diverse markets and applications. UEI is a leading provider of data acquisition and control solutions for the aerospace, defense, energy and semiconductor industries. UEI and Amplifier Research are part of EIG. Paragon and Bison are part of EMG.

The following table represents the allocation of the purchase price for the net assets of the 2023 acquisitions based on the estimated fair values at acquisition (in millions):

Table of Contents

| | Paragon Medical | Other Acquisitions | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | (in millions) | (in millions) | (in millions) |
| Property, plant and equipment | $ 211.4 | $ 23.7 | $ 235.1 |
| Goodwill | 907.0 | 104.7 | 1,011.7 |
| Other intangible assets | 874.0 | 171.3 | 1,045.3 |
| Deferred income taxes | (213.4) | (10.7) | (224.1) |
| ROU lease asset | 51.4 | 4.4 | 55.8 |
| Lease liabilities | (51.0) | (4.5) | (55.5) |
| Net working capital and other (1) | 112.8 | 56.8 | 169.6 |
| Total cash paid | $ 1,892.2 | $ 345.7 | $ 2,237.9 |

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The amount allocated to goodwill is reflective of the benefits the Company expects to realize from the acquisitions. Paragon's portfolio of single-use and consumable surgical instruments and implantable components meaningfully expands the Company's presence in the MedTech market and complements the Company's existing medical businesses. Amplifier Research's expertise and capability in amplifier design complements the Company's existing capabilities in the electromagnetic compatibility testing market. UEI's innovative solutions complement the Company's existing testing and data acquisition expertise. Bison's engineering expertise and broad product portfolio complement the Company's existing motion control and automation solutions business. The Company expects approximately $180.6 million of the goodwill relating to the acquisitions will be tax deductible in future years.

At December 31, 2023, the purchase price allocated to other intangible assets of $1,045.3 million consists of $145.1 million of indefinite-lived intangible trade names, which are not subject to amortization. The remaining $900.2 million of other intangible assets consists of $696.4 million of customer relationships, which are being amortized over a period of 19 to 20 years and $203.8 million of purchased technology, which is being amortized over a period of 10 to 20 years. Amortization expense for each of the next five years for the acquisitions is expected to be $49.7 million per year.

The Company finalized its measurements of certain tangible and intangible assets and liabilities for its September 2022 acquisition of Navitar, Inc., its October 2022 acquisition of RTDS Technologies and its March 2023 acquisition of Bison, which had no material impact to the consolidated statement of income and balance sheet. The Company is in the process of finalizing the measurement of the intangible assets, tangible assets, and liabilities for its acquisitions of Amplifier Research and UEI, as well as, the accounting for income taxes.

The initial accounting for the Paragon acquisition is incomplete, related to finalizing the measurement of the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities, as well as, the associated income tax considerations. All

amounts could change, potentially materially, as there is significant additional information that the Company must obtain to finalize the valuations of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and to finalize the value of the intangible assets, primarily due to the proximity of the acquisition date to the balance sheet date of December 31, 2023.

The acquisitions had an immaterial impact on reported net sales, net income, and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2023. Had the acquisitions been made at the beginning of 2023 or 2022, unaudited pro forma net income and diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, would not have been materially different than the amounts reported. Had the acquisitions been made at the beginning of 2023 or 2022, unaudited pro forma net sales would have been approximately 8% higher than reported amounts for the year ended December 31, 2023 and would have been approximately11% higher than reported amounts for the year ended December 31, 2022.

In 2022, the Company spent $429.7 million in cash, net of cash acquired, to acquire Navitar, Inc.("Navitar") in September 2022 and RTDS Technologies Inc. ("RTDS") in October 2022. Navitar is a market leader in the design, development and manufacturing of customized, fully integrated optical imaging systems, cameras, components and software. RTDS is a leading provider of real-time power simulation systems used by utilities, and research and education institutions in the development and testing of the electric power grid and renewable energy applications. Navitar and RTDS are part of EIG.

In 2021, the Company spent $1,959.2 million in cash, net of cash acquired, to acquire Magnetrol International ("Magnetrol"), Crank Software, and EGS Automation ("EGS") in March 2021, NSI-MI Technologies ("NSI-MI") and Abaco Systems, Inc. ("Abaco") in April 2021, and Alphasense in November 2021. Magnetrol is a leading provider of level and flow control solutions for challenging process applications across a diverse set of end markets including medical, pharmaceutical, oil and gas, food and beverage, and general industrial.

The Company elected to pay the cash tax cost of the one-time mandatory tax on previously deferred earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries over an eight-year period. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has a remaining cash tax obligation of $35.9 million, $9.0 million is classified as current and the remaining portion is classified as non-current.

The Company has evaluated the impact of the global intangible low-taxed income ("GILTI") section of the Tax Act and has made a tax accounting policy election to record the annual tax cost of GILTI as a current period expense when incurred and, as such, will not be measuring an impact of GILTI in its determination of deferred taxes.

As a result of the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation and the taxable inclusions under the GILTI provisions of the Tax Act, the Company has approximately $938.1 million in previously taxed income ("PTI") as of December 31, 2023 which can be repatriated without incremental U.S. Federal tax. The Company intends to reinvest its earnings indefinitely in operations outside the United States except to the extent of the PTI. There has been no provision for U.S. deferred income taxes for the undistributed earnings over PTI of approximately $385.4 million and $60.4 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022 respectively because determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable.

As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company recorded deferred income taxes totaling $15.0 million and $12.4 million respectively in state income and foreign withholding taxes expected to be incurred when the cash amounts related to the previously taxed income are ultimately repatriated to the U.S.

The Company is acquisitive and at times acquires entities with tax attributes (net operating losses or tax credits) that carry over to post-acquisition tax periods of the Company. At December 31, 2023, the Company had tax effected benefits, net of uncertain tax positions of $109.0 million related to net operating loss carryforwards, which will be available to offset future income taxes payable, subject to certain annual or other limitations based on foreign and U.S. tax laws. This amount includes net operating loss carryforwards of $1.9 million for federal income tax purposes with no valuation allowance for the U.S. consolidated group, $8.8 million for state income tax purposes with a valuation allowance of $2.8 million, and $98.3 million for foreign income tax purposes with a valuation allowance of $4.7 million. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, if not used, will expire between 2024 and 2043. The majority of the foreign net operating loss carryforwards can be carried forward indefinitely with the remaining portion set to expire between 2028 and 2043, if not used.

At December 31, 2023, the Company had tax effected benefits of $17.5 million related to tax credit carryforwards, which will be available to offset future income taxes payable, subject to certain annual or other limitations based on foreign and U.S. tax laws. This primarily includes foreign tax credit carryforwards of $9.3 million, $7.0 million for state income tax purposes with a valuation allowance of $2.7 million, and $0.6 million for foreign income tax purposes with a valuation allowance of $0.6 million. These tax credit carryforwards, if not used, will expire between 2024 and 2043.

As of December 31, 2023, the Company has $13.2 million of IRC Section 163(j) interest expense limitation carryforwards which have an indefinite carryforward period.

The Company maintains a valuation allowance to reduce certain deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized. This allowance relates to deferred tax assets established for federal, state, and foreign net operating losses, credit carryforwards, and other miscellaneous timing items. In 2023, the Company recorded a net increase of $7.2 million in the valuation allowance. The increase primarily relates to a valuation allowance of $4.0 million recorded against nondepreciable UK fixed assets which have been deemed unlikely to meet the recognition criteria. The remainder of the increase relates to valuation allowances recorded against foreign net operating losses and tax credits in the amounts of $2 million and $0.6 million respectively.

At December 31, 2023, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $233.5 million, of which $185.2 million, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. At December 31, 2022, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $174.7 million, of which $128.5 million, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate.

At December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company reported $18.3 million and $12.4 million, respectively, related to interest and penalties as a component of other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. During 2023, the Company recognized a net expense of $5.9 million, and in 2022 net expense of $3.2 million, for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the consolidated statement of income as a component of income tax expense.

Approximately 56% of the Company's overall tax liability is incurred in the United States. The Company files income tax returns in various other state and foreign tax jurisdictions, in some cases for multiple legal entities per jurisdiction. Generally, the Company has open tax years subject to tax audit on average of between three and six years in these jurisdictions. At December 31, 2023, the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") audit of the Company's consolidated U.S. income tax returns for the year 2018 and 2019 is ongoing. The Company has not materially extended any other statutes of limitation for any significant location and has reviewed and accrued for, where necessary, tax liabilities for open periods including state and foreign jurisdictions that remain subject to examination. There have been no penalties asserted or imposed by the IRS related to substantial understatement of income, gross valuation misstatement or failure to disclose a listed or reportable transaction.

During 2023, the Company added $75.5 million of tax, interest and penalties related to identified uncertain tax positions and reversed $10.7 million of tax and interest related to statute expirations and settlement of prior uncertain positions. During 2022, the Company added $43.4 million of tax, interest and penalties related to identified uncertain tax positions and reversed $4.4 million of tax and interest related to statute expirations and settlement of prior uncertain positions.

In 2023, the additions above primarily reflect the increase in tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions related to certain higher transfer pricing risks for intangible assets. The reductions above primarily relate to statute expirations. The net increase of $58.8 million in uncertain tax positions resulted in an increase of $34.8 million to income tax expense and the remainder primarily in goodwill. At December 31, 2023, tax, interest and penalties of $241.7 million were classified as a non-current liability and $10.2 million was reflected as a reduction against deferred tax assets.

11. Share-Based Compensation

______________________________________________________________________

Under the terms of the Company's stockholder-approved share-based plans, performance restricted stock units ("PRSUs"), incentive and non-qualified stock options and restricted stock have been, and may be, issued to the Company's officers, management-level employees and members of its Board of Directors. Stock options granted generally vest at a rate of one-third on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date and have a maximum contractual term of ten years. Restricted stock granted to employees generally vests one-third on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date. Restricted stock granted to non-employee directors generally vests two years after the grant date (cliff vesting) and is subject to accelerated vesting due to certain events, including doubling of the grant price of the Company's common stock as of the close of business during any five consecutive trading days.

## Share Based Compensation Expense

The Company measures and records compensation expense related to all stock awards by recognizing the grant date fair value of the awards over their requisite service periods in the financial statements. For grants under any of the Company's plans that are subject to graded vesting based on a service condition, the Company recognizes expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award.

Total share-based compensation expense was as follows for the years ended December 31:

Table of Contents

| | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| | (In thousands) | (In thousands) | (In thousands) |
| Stock option expense | $ 14,284 | $ 13,021 | $ 12,733 |
| Restricted stock expense | 20,792 | 20,115 | 21,393 |
| PRSU expense | 11,123 | 14,239 | 11,977 |
| Total pre-tax expense | $ 46,199 | $ 47,375 | $ 46,103 |

Pre-tax share-based compensation expense is included in the consolidated statement of income in either Cost of sales or Selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on where the recipient's cash compensation is reported.

## Stock Options

The fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model.The following weighted average assumptions were used in the Black-Scholes-Merton model to estimate the fair values of stock options granted during the years indicated:

| | 2023 | 2022 | 2021 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Expected volatility | 26.0 % | 24.5 % | 24.2 % |
| Expected term (years) | 5.0 | 5.0 | 5.0 |
| Risk-free interest rate | 3.54 % | 2.33 % | 0.85 % |
| Expected dividend yield | 0.72 % | 0.65 % | 0.66 % |
| Black-Scholes-Merton fair value per stock option granted | $ 38.11 | $ 32.54 | $ 25.63 |

Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's stock over the stock options' expected term. The Company used historical exercise data to estimate the stock options' expected term, which represents the period of time that the stock options granted are expected to be outstanding. Management anticipates that the future stock option holding periods will be similar to the historical stock option holding periods. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected term of the stock option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve at the time of grant. The expected dividend yield is calculated by dividing the Company's annual dividend, based on

## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -(Continued)

the most recent quarterly dividend rate, by the Company's closing common stock price on the grant date. Compensation expense recognized for all share-based awards is net of estimated forfeitures. The Company's estimated forfeiture rates are based on its historical experience.

The following is a summary of the Company's stock option activity and related information for the year ended December 31, 2023:

| Exercisable at the end of the year | 1,831 | $ 84.65 | 5.6 | $ 147.0 |

The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $54.9 million, $50.3 million and $59.1 million, respectively. The total fair value of stock options vested during 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $12.8 million, $11.4 million and $13.7 million, respectively.

The following is a summary of the Company's non-vested stock option activity and related information for the year ended December 31, 2023:

| | Shares (In thousands) | Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Non-vested stock options outstanding at the beginning of the year | 1,116 | $ 26.57 |
| Granted | 453 | 38.11 |
| Vested | (588) | 21.83 |
| Forfeited | (71) | 31.68 |
| Non-vested stock options outstanding at the end of the year | 910 | $ 34.98 |

As of December 31, 2023, there was approximately $18 million of expected future pre-tax compensation expense related to the0.9 million non-vested stock options outstanding, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of less than two years.

## Restricted Stock

The fair value of restricted shares under the Company's restricted stock arrangement is determined by the product of the number of shares granted and the Company's closing common stock price on the grant date. Upon the grant of restricted stock, the fair value of the restricted shares (unearned compensation) at the grant date is charged as a reduction of capital in excess of par value in the Company's consolidated balance sheet and is amortized to expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is the same as the calculated derived service period as determined on the grant date.

| Forfeited | (30) | 127.80 |
| Non-vested restricted stock outstanding at the end of the year | 296 | $ 135.39 |

The total fair value of restricted stock vested during 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $20.5 million, $17.7 million and $28.6 million, respectively. The weighted average fair value of restricted stock granted per share during 2023 and 2022 was $139.08 and $134.52, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, there was approximately $24 million of expected future pre-tax compensation expense related to the 0.3 million non-vested restricted shares outstanding, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of less than two years.

## Performance Restricted Stock Units

The PRSUs vest over a period up tothree years from the grant date based on continuous service, with the number of shares earned (0% to 200% of the target award) depending upon the extent to which the Company achieves certain financial and market performance targets measured over the period from January 1 of the year of grant through December 31 of the third year. Half of the PRSUs are valued in a manner similar to restricted stock as the financial targets are based on the Company's operating results. The grant date fair value of these PRSUs are recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period based on the number of awards expected to vest at each reporting date. The other half of the PRSUs were valued using a Monte Carlo model as the performance target is related to the Company's total shareholder return compared to a group of peer companies, which represents a market condition. The Company recognizes the grant date fair value of these awards as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period.

The following is a summary of the Company's non-vested performance restricted stock activity and related information for the year ended December 31, 2023:

| | Shares (In thousands) | Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value |

12. Retirement Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits

______________________________________________________________________

## Retirement and Pension Plans

The Company sponsors several retirement and pension plans covering eligible salaried and hourly employees. The plans generally provide benefits based on participants' years of service and/or compensation. The following is a brief description of the Company's retirement and pension plans.

The Company maintains contributory and non-contributory defined benefit pension plans. Benefits for eligible salaried and hourly employees under all defined benefit plans are funded through trusts established in conjunction with the plans. The Company's funding policy with respect to its defined benefit plans is to contribute amounts that provide for benefits based on actuarial calculations and the applicable requirements of U.S. federal and local foreign laws. The Company estimates that it will make both required and discretionary cash contributions of approximately $7 million to $11 million to its worldwide defined benefit pension plans in 2024.

The Company uses a measurement date of December 31 (its fiscal year end) for its U.S. and foreign defined benefit pension plans.

The Company sponsors a 401(k) retirement and savings plan for eligible U.S. employees. Participants in the retirement and savings plan may contribute a specified portion of their compensation on a pre-tax basis, which varies by location. The Company matches employee contributions ranging from 20% to 100%, up to a maximum percentage ranging from 1% to 8% of eligible compensation or up to a maximum of $1,200 per participant in some locations.

The Company's retirement and savings plan has a defined contribution retirement feature principally to cover U.S. salaried employees joining the Company after December 31, 1996. Under the retirement feature, the Company makes contributions for eligible employees based on a pre-established percentage of the covered employee's salary subject to pre-established vesting. Employees of certain of the Company's foreign operations participate in various local defined contribution plans.

The Company has non-qualified unfunded retirement plans for certain Directors and retired employees. It also provides supplemental retirement benefits, through contractual arrangements and/or a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") covering certain current and former executives of the Company. These supplemental benefits are designed to compensate the executive for retirement benefits that would have been provided under the Company's primary retirement plan, except for statutory limitations on compensation that must be taken into account under those plans. The plan permits deferred amounts to be deemed invested in either, or a combination of, an interest-bearing account, phantom mutual fund accounts or the equivalent of a fund which invests in shares of the Company's common stock on behalf of the employee. The amount owed to participants is an unfunded and unsecured general obligation which is payable out of either the general assets of the Company or a grant of shares of the Company's common stock upon retirement or termination. The Company is providing for these obligations by charges to earnings over the applicable periods.

U.S. equity securities and global equity securities categorized as level 1 are traded on national and international exchanges and are valued at their closing prices on the last trading day of the year. Some U.S. equity securities and global equity securities are public investment vehicles valued using the Net Asset Value ("NAV") provided by the fund manager. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the number of shares outstanding.

Fixed income securities categorized as level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data, bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics.

The expected long-term rate of return on these plan assets was7.59% in 2023 and 6.75% in 2022. Equity securities included 232,710 shares of AMETEK, Inc. common stock with a market value of $38.4 million (6.4% of total plan investment assets) at December 31, 2023 and352,601 shares of AMETEK, Inc. common stock with a market value of $49.3 million (8.7% of total plan investment assets) at December 31, 2022.

The objectives of the Company's U.S. defined benefit plans' investment strategy are to maximize the plans' funded status and minimize Company contributions and plan expense. Because the goal is to optimize returns over the long term, an investment policy that favors equity holdings has been established. Since there may be periods of time where both equity and mutual fund markets provide poor returns, an allocation to alternative assets may be made to improve the overall portfolio's diversification and return potential. The Company periodically reviews its asset allocation, taking into consideration plan liabilities, plan benefit payment streams and the investment strategy of the pension plans. The actual asset allocation is monitored frequently relative to the established targets and ranges and is re-balanced when necessary. The target allocations for the U.S. defined benefits plans are approximately 50% equity securities, 20% fixed income securities and 30% other securities and/or cash.

The equity portfolio is diversified by market capitalization and style. The equity portfolio also includes international components.

The objective of the mutual fund portion of the pension assets is to provide interest rate sensitivity for a portion of the assets and to provide diversification. The mutual fund portfolio is diversified within certain quality and maturity guidelines to minimize the adverse effects of interest rate fluctuations.

Certain investments are prohibited and include venture capital, private placements, unregistered or restricted stock, margin trading, commodities, short selling and rights and warrants. Foreign currency futures, options and forward contracts may be used to manage foreign currency exposure.

The objective of the Company's foreign defined benefit plans' investment strategy is to maximize the long-term rate of return on plan investments, subject to a reasonable level of risk. Liability studies are also performed on a regular basis to provide guidance in setting investment goals with an objective to balance risks against the current and future needs of the plans. The trustees consider the risk associated with the different asset classes, relative to the plans' liabilities and how this can be affected by diversification, and the relative returns available on equities, mutual fund investments, real estate and cash. Also, the likely volatility of those returns and the cash flow requirements of the plans are considered. It is expected that equities will outperform mutual fund investments over the long term. However, the trustees recognize the fact that mutual fund investments may better match the liabilities for pensioners. Because of the relatively young active employee group covered by the plans and the immature nature of the plans, the trustees have chosen to adopt an asset allocation strategy more heavily weighted toward equity investments. This asset allocation strategy will be reviewed, from time to time, in view of changes in market conditions and in the plans' liability profile. The target allocations for the foreign defined benefit plans are approximately 23% equity securities, 21% fixed income securities, 51% multi-asset funds and 5% other securities, insurance or cash.

The assumption for the expected return on plan assets was developed based on a review of historical investment returns for the investment categories for the defined benefit pension assets. This review also considered current capital market conditions and projected future investment returns. The estimates of future capital market returns by asset class are lower than the actual long-term historical returns. Therefore, the assumed rate of return for U.S. plans is 7.46% and 6.49% for foreign plans in 2024.

## Postretirement Plans and Post-employment Benefits

The Company provides limited postretirement benefits other than pensions for certain retirees and a small number of former employees. Benefits under these arrangements are not funded and are not significant.

The Company also provides limited post-employment benefits for certain former or inactive employees after employment but before retirement. Those benefits are not significant in amount.

The Company has a deferred compensation plan, which allows employees whose compensation exceeds the statutory IRS limit for retirement benefits to defer a portion of earned bonus compensation. The plan permits deferred amounts to be deemed invested in either, or a combination of, an interest-bearing account, phantom mutual fund accounts or the equivalent of a fund which invests in shares of the Company's common stock on behalf of the employee. The amount owed to participants is an unfunded and unsecured general obligation which is payable out of either the general assets of the Company or a grant of shares of the Company's common stock. The amount deferred under the plan, including income earned, was $35.9 million and $31.8 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Administrative expense for the deferred compensation plan is borne by the Company and is not significant.

13. Contingencies

______________________________________________________________________

## Indemnifications

In conjunction with certain acquisition and divestiture transactions, the Company may agree to make payments to compensate or indemnify other parties for possible future unfavorable financial consequences resulting from specified events (e.g., breaches of contract obligations or retention of previously existing environmental, tax or employee liabilities) whose terms range in duration and often are not explicitly defined. Where appropriate, the obligation for such indemnifications is recorded as a liability. Because the amount of these types of indemnifications generally is not specifically stated, the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such indemnifications cannot be reasonably estimated. Further, the Company indemnifies its directors and officers for claims against them in connection with their positions with the Company. Historically, any such costs incurred to settle claims related to these indemnifications have been minimal for the Company. The Company believes that future payments, if any, under all existing indemnification agreements would not have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

## Asbestos Litigation

The Company (including its subsidiaries) has been named as a defendant in a number of asbestos-related lawsuits. Certain of these lawsuits relate to a business which was acquired by the Company and do not involve products which were manufactured or sold by the Company. In connection with these lawsuits, the seller of such business has agreed to indemnify the Company against these claims (the "Indemnified Claims"). The Indemnified Claims have been tendered to, and are being defended by, such seller. The seller has met its obligations, in all respects, and the Company does not have any reason to believe such party would fail to fulfill its obligations in the future. To date, no judgments have been rendered against the Company as a result of any asbestos-related lawsuit. The Company believes that it has good and valid defenses to each of these claims and intends to defend them vigorously.

## Environmental Matters

Certain historic processes in the manufacture of products have resulted in environmentally hazardous waste by-products as defined by federal and state laws and regulations. At December 31, 2023, the Company is named a Potentially Responsible Party ("PRP") at 12 non-AMETEK-owned former waste disposal or treatment sites (the "non-owned"sites). The Company is identified as a "de minimis" party in a majority of these sites based on the low volume of waste attributed to the Company relative to the amounts attributed to other named PRPs. The Company is participating in the investigation and/or related required remediation as part of a PRP Group and reserves have been established sufficient to satisfy the Company's expected obligations. The Company historically has resolved these issues within established reserve levels and reasonably expects this result will continue. In

## AMETEK, Inc.

## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -(Continued)

addition to these non-owned sites, the Company has an ongoing practice of providing reserves for probable remediation activities at certain of its current or previously owned manufacturing locations (the "owned" sites). For claims and proceedings against the Company with respect to other environmental matters, reserves are established once the Company has determined that a loss is probable and estimable. This estimate is refined as the Company moves through the various stages of investigation, risk assessment, feasibility study and corrective action processes. In certain instances, the Company has developed a range of estimates for such costs and has recorded a liability based on the best estimate. It is reasonably possible that the actual cost of remediation of the individual sites could vary from the current estimates and the amounts accrued in the consolidated financial statements; however, the amounts of such variances are not expected to result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements. In estimating the Company's liability for remediation, the Company also considers the likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation expense and the ability of the other PRPs to fulfill their obligations.

Total environmental reserves at December 31, 2023 and 2022 were $37.1 million and $41.0 million, respectively, for both non-owned and owned sites. In 2023, the Company recorded $6.0 million in reserves. Additionally, in 2023 the Company spent $9.9 million on environmental matters. The total environmental expense is included in Other income and expense in the consolidated statement of income.

The Company has agreements with other former owners of certain of its acquired businesses, as well as new owners of previously owned businesses. Under certain of the agreements, the former or new owners retained, or assumed and agreed to indemnify the Company against, certain environmental and other liabilities under certain circumstances. The Company and some of these other parties also carry insurance coverage for some environmental matters.

The Company believes it has established reserves for the environmental matters described above, which are sufficient to perform all known responsibilities under existing claims and consent orders. In the opinion of management, based on presently available information and the Company's historical experience related to such matters, an adequate provision for probable costs has been made and the ultimate cost resulting from these actions is not expected to materially affect the consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the Company.

14. Leases and Other Commitments

## Other Commitments

As of December 31, 2023, and 2022, the Company had $790.0 million and $1,119.7 million, respectively, in purchase obligations outstanding, which primarily consisted of contractual commitments to purchase certain inventories at fixed prices.

The Company does not provide significant guarantees on a routine basis. The Company primarily issues guarantees, stand-by letters of credit and surety bonds in the ordinary course of its business to provide financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries to support or enhance the subsidiary's stand-alone creditworthiness. The amounts subject to certain of these agreements vary depending on the covered contracts outstanding at any particular point in time. At December 31, 2023, the maximum amount of future payment obligations relative to these various guarantees was $302.5 million and the outstanding liability under certain of those guarantees was $193.6 million.

15. Reportable Segments and Geographic Areas Information

______________________________________________________________________

## Descriptive Information about Reportable Segments

The Company has two reportable segments, EIG and EMG. The Company's operating segments are identified based on the existence of segment managers. Certain of the Company's operating segments have been aggregated for segment reporting purposes primarily on the basis of product type, production processes, distribution methods and similarity of economic characteristics.

EIG manufactures advanced instruments for the process, power and industrial, and aerospace markets. It provides process and analytical instruments for the oil and gas, petrochemical, pharmaceutical, semiconductor, automation, and food and beverage industries. EIG also provides instruments to the laboratory equipment, ultraprecision manufacturing, medical, and test and measurement markets. It makes power quality monitoring and metering devices, uninterruptible power supplies, programmable power equipment, electromagnetic compatibility test equipment and gas turbines sensors. EIG also provides dashboard instruments for heavy trucks and other vehicles, as well as instrumentation and controls for the food and beverage industries. It supplies the aerospace and defense industry with aircraft and engine sensors, embedded computing systems, monitoring systems, power supplies, fuel and fluid measurement systems, and data acquisition systems.

EMG designs and manufactures highly engineered medical components and devices, automation solutions, thermal management systems, specialty metals and electrical interconnects. EMG products include single-use and consumable surgical instruments, implantable components, and drug delivery systems used across a wide range of medical applications. It also manufactures highly engineered electrical connectors and electronic packaging used to protect sensitive electronic devices. EMG makes precision motion control products for data storage, medical devices, business equipment, automation and other applications. It supplies high-purity powdered metals, strip and foil, specialty clad metals and metal matrix composites. EMG also manufactures motors used in commercial appliances, food and beverage machines, hydraulic pumps and industrial blowers. It produces motor-blower systems and heat exchangers used in thermal management and other applications on a variety of military and commercial aircraft and military ground vehicles. EMG also operates a global network of aviation maintenance, repair and overhaul facilities.

## Measurement of Segment Results

Segment operating income represents net sales less all direct costs and expenses (including certain administrative and other expenses) applicable to each segment but does not include interest expense. Net sales by segment are reported after elimination of intra- and inter-segment sales and profits, which are insignificant in amount. Reported segment assets include allocations directly related to the segment's operations. Corporate assets consist primarily of investments, pensions, insurance deposits and deferred taxes.
